    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Assessor - Expertise in evaluating risks and rewards\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to work with. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent, it's often best to start with a randomized strategy to avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without any prior moves to analyze, we can't identify any patterns in the opponent's behavior. However, many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate the risks:\n- If we choose rock: We tie if opponent chose rock, win if they chose scissors, lose if they chose paper\n- If we choose paper: We tie if opponent chose paper, win if they chose rock, lose if they chose scissors\n- If we choose scissors: We tie if opponent chose scissors, win if they chose paper, lose if they chose rock\n\nGiven the psychology that many players choose rock first, paper might give us a slight advantage.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with this analysis. Paper has a psychological advantage as a first move since it counters the common \"rock\" opening while not appearing as aggressive as scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the likelihood of opponents choosing rock as a first move, and the balanced risk-reward ratio of the paper choice.\n"

However, we need to consider that the opponent will likely adapt their strategy after losing.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent used rock in the first round and lost. Based on typical player psychology, they are likely to:\n1. Either change their move completely to try to counter our paper\n2. Or stick to rock thinking we might expect them to change\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze the opponent's likely thought process:\n- They know we used paper successfully\n- They might expect us to use paper again (thinking we'll stick to a winning move)\n- If they think we'll use paper again, they would choose scissors\n- However, if they think we're thinking this deeply, they might expect us to switch to rock to counter their potential scissors\n\nGame Strategist: This is getting into multiple levels of mind games. In such situations, it's often best to avoid overthinking. Given that our opponent just lost to paper, scissors would be their most logical counter. Therefore, rock would be our safest move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Most players tend to make a complete strategy shift after losing, rather than sticking to their losing move or trying to outthink their opponent at multiple levels.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors after losing to our paper in the previous round\n"

If this pattern holds true, they would play our last move (rock) in this round. This is actually a known strategy called \"copy last move\" or \"imitation strategy\". \n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze:\n- If they follow the pattern, they will play rock (copying our last move)\n- If we play paper, we would win IF they stick to this pattern\n- However, they might have realized we could figure out their strategy and change it\n- Risk level of playing paper is moderate, as it would only lose to scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: The imitation pattern is too clear to ignore. Even if they try to break their pattern now, they've shown a tendency to play reactively rather than randomly. Paper would be both a good counter to their pattern and a reasonable move even if they deviate.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Playing paper here has multiple advantages:\n1. It beats rock if they stick to their copying strategy\n2. It's the move that won us our first round\n3.

Instead, they seem to be cycling through the moves in order: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Excellent observation! If they're following this cycling pattern, their next move should be rock again, starting the cycle over. This is also a known strategy called \"cycling\" or \"rotating moves.\"\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate:\n- If they continue the cycle: they will play rock\n- If they realize we might have figured out their pattern: they might break it\n- However, they've shown consistency in their strategy so far\n- The safest counter to their predicted rock would be paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: I disagree with using paper. They might expect us to figure out their pattern, and we've already lost twice. We should break our own predictability.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree.
