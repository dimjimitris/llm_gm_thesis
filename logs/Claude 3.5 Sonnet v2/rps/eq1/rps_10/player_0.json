    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Decision Maker - For making final move decisions based on inputs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no history, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal. However, research has shown that \"rock\" is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data to analyze, we can only rely on statistical tendencies of human players. Studies indeed suggest that rock is the most commonly chosen first move, followed by scissors, then paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this information, I suggest we counter the statistically most likely move (rock) by choosing paper. This gives us the best chance of winning if our opponent follows the common pattern, while not leaving us too vulnerable if they don't.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. If opponent plays rock (most likely), we win. If they play scissors, we lose, and if they play paper, we tie. This gives us positive expected value given the statistical tendencies of first moves.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now, we need to consider how a player typically reacts after losing with rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: After losing with rock against paper, players often exhibit one of two common behaviors:\n1. They might switch to scissors to beat our previous move (paper), assuming we'll use it again\n2. They might stick with rock, thinking we'll expect them to change\n\nDecision Maker: The opponent just lost using rock against our paper. Given human psychology, they're more likely to want to win against our previous move (paper) rather than stick with a losing strategy. Therefore, scissors is their most likely next move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. If we expect scissors, we should play rock. This also protects us against them repeating rock, though that's less likely. The only risk is if they play paper, but that seems the least likely option given the game state and psychology.\n\nPattern Analyst: The quick success of their opponent often makes players want to \"break\" their opponent's winning strategy, further supporting the likelihood of them switching to scissors to counter our previous paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

It would both counter our previous successful move and complete their rotation through all options.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

This is significant. Also, they seem to be alternating between rock and scissors, though not in a perfectly predictable way. Looking at their last move (scissors), if they continue this pattern, they're due for a rock play.\n\nDecision Maker: Several considerations:\n1. Their avoidance of paper might continue\n2. They've been alternating between rock and scissors\n3. After losing again, they might finally try paper to break their pattern\n4. They might recognize that we've figured out their rock-scissors tendency\n\nGame Strategist: Given their consistent avoidance of paper throughout all rounds, and their apparent comfort with rock and scissors, I think they're most likely to continue this behavior. Based on their alternating pattern and their last move being scissors, rock is their most probable next move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The psychological barrier of not having used paper for five rounds makes it less likely they'll start now. The alternating pattern, even though they might be aware we've noticed it, has become a comfort zone for them.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play paper to counter their likely rock move.

The combination of frustration from losses, awareness of their pattern being read, and having never used paper makes this the highest probability yet of them choosing paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given this analysis, we should play scissors to counter their likely first use of paper.

Make a desperate attempt to be unpredictable by playing their least used move\n2. Give up on strategy and play randomly\n3. Try to end with dignity by playing their preferred move one last time\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern of behavior throughout the game, I believe they're most likely to play scissors next. Here's why:\n1. They've seen rock repeatedly fail\n2. Scissors is their second-most successful move\n3. They might anticipate us playing paper again after it just worked\n4. It would be a logical counter to our previous winning move\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The psychology suggests they'll try to counter our paper play, rather than stick with rock which has failed so many times.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play rock to counter their likely scissors play. Even if they try paper instead, we've been so successful at reading their moves that it's worth the risk.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This was the first tie of the game\n2. They finally broke away from their pattern of losses\n3. They might feel some small victory in avoiding a loss\n4. They've used rock more than any other move by far\n\nDecision Maker: This is an interesting psychological moment:\n1. The tie might give them a small confidence boost\n2.

They could either:\n   a) Stick with rock since it at least didn't lose\n   b) Try to capitalize on the momentum by changing moves\n   c) Expect us to change our move after the tie\n\nGame Strategist: In situations following a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the move that created the tie, feeling it's \"safer\"\n2. Try to gain advantage by predicting their opponent will change moves\n3. Change their own move to try to win rather than tie again\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their overall preference for rock and the psychological relief of finally not losing, I believe they're most likely to stick with rock.

It counters their likely rock play\n2. Even if they expect us to play rock again for another tie, paper would win\n3. Our paper play has been very successful against their tendency to use rock\n4.
