    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The opponent is showing a strong commitment to paper:\n   - They've now won multiple times with paper against rock\n   - They're sticking with it even when it loses to scissors\n2. Their strategy appears to be:\n   - Exploiting my tendency to switch to rock after successful scissors plays\n   - Using paper as a safe move that beats rock and at worst loses to scissors\n3. They seem to have identified and are exploiting a pattern in my play\n4. Therefore, scissors is the best counter to break their paper strategy\n\nThis move aims to punish their paper persistence while breaking my own predictable pattern of rock after scissors success, which they've been exploiting.\n"
