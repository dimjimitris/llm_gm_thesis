Psychological analysis:\n   - After their win and a tie, they're likely thinking more clearly\n   - They might feel they've figured out my strategy\n   - The tie suggests they're being more cautious\n   - They're probably gaining confidence\n\n4. Their likely thought process:\n   - They might expect me to try paper to beat their rock\n   - They could be planning to counter my expected paper with scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with rock after the tie\n   - They're showing more sophisticated thinking\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Their improved play suggests they're thinking ahead\n   - After a rock-rock tie, paper is an obvious next move\n   - They're likely to anticipate this and play scissors\n   - Therefore:\n     * Rock would be best to:\n       - Counter their likely scissors\n       - Protect against their improved strategic thinking\n       - Break their growing confidence\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might abandon that move\n   - They've seen rock beat them twice now\n   - They might expect me to stick with rock after it worked\n   - They're likely to try to counter my recent successful rock\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they think I'll use rock again, they'll use paper\n   - If they're frustrated, they might return to scissors\n   - If they're being meta, they might use rock expecting my paper\n\n5.
