    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, each move has equal probability of winning (1/3), losing (1/3), or tying (1/3).\n\n3. Since there's no historical data to base a decision on, I should avoid being predictable and choose randomly among the three options.\n\n4. Psychological research suggests that in RPS, rock is often the most common first move choice among humans, as it represents strength and stability.\n\n5. Given this, paper might be a good counter-strategy for a first move, as it would beat the most commonly chosen opening move.\n\n6. However, a sophisticated player might anticipate this thinking and choose scissors.\n\n7. Without more information, I'll go with paper as it balances potential reward with risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Potential strategies:\n   - Stay with paper (risky, likely predictable)\n   - Switch to rock (good if they switch to scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (good if they switch to paper, but risky if they switch to rock)\n\n5.

Analyzing the tie situation:\n   - A tie with scissors shows we were thinking similarly\n   - After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" each other\n   - Many players tend to shift to rock after scissors, as it's psychologically seen as a \"stronger\" move\n\n3.

Decision:\n   - Pattern has become too predictable after three successes\n   - Opponent will almost certainly adapt\n   - Need to break my own pattern before they counter it\n   - Instead of rotating to rock, staying with scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"
