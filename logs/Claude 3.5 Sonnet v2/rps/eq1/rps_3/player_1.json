    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a fresh player, we have no prior history to analyze. In such cases, people often default to 'rock' as their first move, as it's perceived as strong and stable.\n\nGame Strategist: While that's a valid psychological observation, we should also consider that in RPS, no single move is inherently better than others. Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying in a purely random game.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any previous moves to analyze, we're starting from a blank slate. However, knowing that opponents might be aware of the \"rock as first move\" tendency, they might try to counter it with paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Given these insights, I suggest we play paper. It counters the common 'rock' first move, and even if they play scissors, we're no worse off than any other losing scenario.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. It's a strategic choice that:\n1. Counters the most common opening move (rock)\n2. Shows sophisticated thinking (anticipating opponent's likely move)\n3. Has the same downside risk as any other move (-1 in worst case)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After careful consideration of common opening strategies and player psychology, I choose paper.\n"

They might try to predict our next move based on the tie\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel a need to \"break the deadlock\" by changing their move. Our opponent might expect us to switch from paper, and they might switch too.\n\nGame Strategist: In RPS, when both players know the previous round was a tie with paper, there's interesting psychology at play. Many players will either:\n1. Switch to scissors thinking their opponent will stick with paper\n2. Switch to rock anticipating their opponent will switch to scissors\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider the most likely scenario. If our opponent is thinking strategically, they might expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper), so they might play rock to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play paper again. Here's why:\n1. It beats rock, which our opponent might play to counter an expected scissors from us\n2. It's psychologically unexpected - most players feel compelled to change after a tie\n3. If they play scissors (expecting us to stay with paper), we lose no more than we would with any other losing move\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. The \"double-paper\" strategy could be especially effective because it goes against the common urge to switch moves after a tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper While players often switch after a tie, maintaining paper could catch our opponent trying to counter an expected change on our part.\n"

Having lost to paper, they might be especially reluctant to play rock again. Additionally, being beaten by the same move (paper) might frustrate them into trying to directly counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their likely frustration at losing to paper twice (one tie, one loss), there's a high probability they'll play scissors this time to counter our paper strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the psychological assessment. The opponent has seen paper from us twice now, and they lost to it in the last round. They're very likely to expect us to use paper again and will probably use scissors to counter it.\n\nPattern Analyst: If we expect them to play scissors, we should switch to rock to counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: The rock play makes sense here because:\n1. It counters the scissors we expect them to play\n2. It shows we can adapt our strategy\n3. Even if they play paper (trying to be clever), we're no worse off than with any other losing move\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The risk-reward ratio favors rock here.

Try to predict our next move based on our pattern\n\nGame Strategist: If they're following the basic sequence, their next move would be paper.

We've won three rounds in a row.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical psychological moment. After losing three times in a row, and twice to the same move (paper), the opponent is likely to be:\n1. Extremely frustrated\n2. Feeling predictable\n3. Desperate to win\n4. Possibly angry at how paper has beaten them\n\nGame Strategist: In such a frustrated state, players often:\n1. Try to be \"unpredictable\" by making what they think is a surprising move\n2. Overcompensate by trying to counter what beat them last\n3. Sometimes resort to their \"comfort move\" under pressure\n\nRisk Manager: Given their recent losses to paper, they are very unlikely to play rock again. The most probable scenarios are:\n1. They'll play scissors to beat our paper (expecting us to use it again)\n2. They might play paper themselves, trying to copy our successful strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: The strongest indication is that they'll finally play scissors to counter our successful paper plays.

They might be in a state of complete psychological surrender\n3. They might be playing purely mechanically without thought\n4. They might be feeling completely helpless\n5. They might make their next move almost randomly out of desperation\n\nGame Strategist: At this extreme point, players typically:\n1. Either completely give up and play randomly\n2. Or make one final desperate attempt to be unpredictable\n3. Or revert to their most basic instincts (often rock)\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has now lost with every possible move multiple times. They might:\n1. Feel that no choice matters anymore\n2. Try to be random to break our prediction streak\n3. Resort to their most basic instinct under extreme stress\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent sequence (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper) is interesting - it's a complete RPS cycle in reverse. In such states of complete defeat, players often resort to rock as it feels psychologically \"strongest\" - a last attempt to show strength.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play paper because:\n1. It beats rock, which is the most likely move from a psychologically defeated player\n2. Even if they play scissors in desperation, we have a massive point lead\n3. It's a strategic choice against an opponent likely to resort to basic instincts\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given the opponent's likely state of complete psychological defeat, expecting them to resort to the \"strongest-feeling\" move of rock, I choose paper.\n"
