    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After I win a round, my opponent has shown this pattern:\n   - After I won in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n\n4. After losing, my opponent has these tendencies:\n   - After losing in round 5, they switched from rock to paper\n   - After losing in round 11 (just now), what will they play?\n\n5. Many players tend to switch strategies after losing, especially when their previous move was clearly countered.\n\n6. Given that my opponent just lost with scissors against my rock, they're likely to abandon scissors.\n\n7. They might choose paper, which would beat my rock if I repeat it.\n\n8. This would align with their behavior after I won in round 5 - they played paper in the next round.\n\n9. Additionally, paper has been their most frequently played move (5 times out of 11 rounds).\n\n10.

After losing twice consecutively:\n   - My opponent just lost with paper against my scissors\n   - Before that, they lost with scissors against my rock\n\n5.

Looking at recent moves, my opponent has played scissors twice in the last three rounds.\n\n4. My opponent seems to have broken from their previous patterns and may have identified that I was starting to predict their moves.\n\n5. When I won two rounds in a row (11 and 12), they responded with scissors in round 13, successfully countering my paper.\n\n6. After winning, my opponent sometimes repeats their successful move:\n   - In rounds 8-9, they repeated paper after it won\n   - They might repeat scissors now after it just won\n\n7. However, they may also anticipate that I'll play rock to counter their scissors, and thus they might play paper.\n\n8. Given their recent adaptability and the fact that they've used scissors successfully twice recently, I believe they're more likely to change than repeat.\n\n9. The safest move against a player who appears to be adapting to my strategy would be rock:\n   - It beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n   - It loses to paper if they're thinking one step ahead\n   - But given their recent scissors preference, rock seems most prudent\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now beaten me in two consecutive rounds with different strategies:\n   - Round 13: They used scissors to beat my paper\n   - Round 14: They used paper to beat my rock\n\n4. This suggests they're either accurately predicting my moves or have developed a strategy that's working well against my patterns.\n\n5.

My best strategy is to break any predictable patterns I might have developed and counter their most likely next move.\n\n10.

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now won with scissors against their paper twice in the last three rounds:\n   - Round 17: I won with scissors against their paper\n   - Round 19: I won with scissors against their paper\n\n4. After losing with paper multiple times, my opponent is likely to change their strategy:\n   - They've now lost with paper in rounds 17 and 19\n   - They've lost with paper against scissors 4 times in total (rounds 12, 17, 19, and now)\n\n5. After losing with paper, they've historically played:\n   - Rock (round 5 to 6)\n   - Scissors (round 12 to 13)\n   - Scissors (round 17 to 18)\n\n6. Their most common response after losing with paper is to play scissors.\n\n7. Additionally, they may expect me to play scissors again after it worked well.\n\n8. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter.\n\n9. Even if they play rock instead (their other post-paper-loss move), rock would at worst tie.\n\n10. Rock provides the best coverage against their most likely responses to their recent losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has lost three consecutive rounds and played scissors in the last two rounds.\n\n5. After losing with scissors multiple times, they're very likely to change their strategy:\n   - Historically, after losing with scissors, they've played paper (rounds 11-12, 16-17)\n\n6. Additionally, they've now played scissors in 3 out of the last 4 rounds, which is unusual given their overall distribution.\n\n7. Given their pattern of switching after consecutive losses and their historical tendency to play paper after losing with scissors, paper seems most likely for their next move.\n\n8. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n9. There's also a possibility they might play rock to counter my potential scissors (if they think I'm anticipating their paper).\n\n10. However, given their strong historical pattern of playing paper after losing with scissors, scissors seems to be the highest probability play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My opponent broke their pattern of playing paper after losing with scissors, and instead played rock in the last round.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after winning with rock:\n   - After winning with rock in round 5, they played paper\n   - After winning with rock in round 15, they played scissors\n   - After winning with rock in round 21, what will they play?\n\n5. There's no consistent pattern in what they play after winning with rock.\n\n6. However, looking at the overall game:\n   - They've played paper 9 times (most frequent)\n   - They've played scissors 7 times\n   - They've played rock 5 times (least frequent)\n\n7. After winning a round, they've shown a slight tendency to switch moves rather than repeat.\n\n8. Given that they just won with rock (their least frequent move), they're likely to switch back to one of their more preferred moves - either paper or scissors.\n\n9. Paper has been their most frequent choice overall, making it slightly more probable.\n\n10. If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n11. However, given their recent unpredictability and the fact that they just countered my scissors with rock, they might anticipate I'll switch to paper and play scissors again.\n\n12. Balancing these possibilities, paper seems to be the safest choice:\n    - It beats rock if they repeat their winning move\n    - It loses to scissors if they switch as they sometimes do after winning\n    - Given their overall preference for paper, this gives me the best chance to either win or tie\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

There's a strong pattern: after winning with scissors, they've consistently played paper in the next round.\n\n7. However, they might recognize that I could detect this pattern and adjust.\n\n8.

They may have recognized that I was exploiting their patterns and have now adjusted their strategy.\n\n5. After winning with rock, their historical pattern has been:\n   - Paper (round 5 to 6)\n   - Scissors (round 15 to 16)\n   - Scissors (round 21 to 22)\n   - After winning with rock in round 25, what will they play?\n\n6. There's a slight tendency for them to play scissors after winning with rock (2 out of 3 instances).\n\n7. Additionally, they've now played rock twice in the last 5 rounds, which is more frequent than their earlier pattern.\n\n8. If they follow their slight pattern of playing scissors after winning with rock, rock would be my best counter.\n\n9. However, given that they just broke one of their strongest patterns, they may be becoming more unpredictable.\n\n10. Since they've played rock in 2 of the last 5 rounds, they may continue with this trend and play rock again.\n\n11. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n\n12. Balancing these possibilities, paper seems to be the safer choice:\n    - It beats rock if they repeat or continue their recent rock trend\n    - It loses to scissors if they follow their historical pattern after winning with rock\n    - Given that they're showing signs of adapting their strategy, countering their most recent move seems prudent\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now played scissors in 3 out of the last 4 rounds, showing a strong recent preference for scissors.\n\n4. After winning with scissors, their historical pattern has been:\n   - Paper (round 3 to 4)\n   - Paper (round 13 to 14)\n   - Paper (round 18 to 19)\n   - Paper (round 22 to 23)\n   - After winning with scissors in round 26, what will they play?\n\n5. There's been a very strong pattern: after winning with scissors, they've played paper 4 out of 4 times.\n\n6. However, they've recently begun breaking their established patterns:\n   - They broke their \"paper after losing with scissors\" pattern in round 25\n   - They may be aware that I'm tracking their patterns\n\n7. If they continue their historical pattern of playing paper after winning with scissors, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. However, given their recent adaptability and heavy use of scissors, they might either:\n   - Continue with scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their expected paper\n   - Switch to rock to counter my potential scissors play\n\n9. Given their recent preference for scissors and the fact that they've been breaking patterns, rock seems like the safest choice:\n   - It beats scissors if they continue their recent scissors trend\n   - It loses to paper if they follow their historical pattern after winning with scissors\n   - Given their recent adaptability, countering their most frequent recent move (scissors) seems prudent\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent did follow their strong pattern of playing paper after winning with scissors, returning to their established pattern after briefly breaking it in round 25.\n\n4. I've now lost three consecutive rounds, suggesting my opponent has gained an advantage in predicting my moves.\n\n5. After winning with paper, their historical pattern has been:\n   - Rock (round 4 to 5)\n   - Scissors (round 6 to 7)\n   - Paper (round 9 to 10)\n   - Scissors (round 14 to 15)\n   - After winning with paper in round 27, what will they play?\n\n6. There's no consistent pattern in what they play after winning with paper, but scissors (2 out of 4 times) is slightly more common than their other moves.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern in the last 10 rounds:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 2 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n8. Scissors has been their most frequent recent move.\n\n9. Given my recent losses and their tendency to play scissors after winning with paper, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter.\n\n11. Additionally, if they're analyzing my patterns, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock themselves. In this case, my rock would tie with theirs.\n\n12. Rock provides good coverage against their most likely moves based on recent history and their patterns after winning with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After rock-rock ties, my opponent has historically played:\n   - Scissors (round 2 to 3)\n   - Scissors (round 10 to 11)\n   - After our rock-rock tie in round 28, what will they play?\n\n4. There's a consistent pattern: after rock-rock ties, they've played scissors 2 out of 2 times.\n\n5. Additionally, after ties in general, they often switch to a different move:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played rock\n   - After rock tie in round 2, they played scissors\n   - After scissors tie in round 7, they played paper\n   - After paper tie in round 8, they played paper (exception)\n   - After rock tie in round 10, they played scissors\n   - After rock tie in round 28, they're likely to switch\n\n6. Given their perfect historical pattern of playing scissors after rock-rock ties, scissors seems to be their most likely next move.\n\n7. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter.\n\n8. However, they might recognize that I could detect this pattern and adapt by playing paper instead.\n\n9. Given their consistent pattern after rock-rock ties and my recent string of losses, I need a move that has the best chance of breaking my losing streak.\n\n10. Rock provides the best coverage against their historical pattern after rock-rock ties, while also being a safe play if they switch to paper (resulting in a loss rather than trying to guess their adaptation).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My prediction in the last round was correct - my opponent followed their pattern of playing scissors after a rock-rock tie.\n\n4.

If they play paper as predicted, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. However, they might recognize that I'm exploiting this pattern and adapt by playing rock instead.\n\n9.
