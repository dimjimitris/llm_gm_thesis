In a single round with no history, each move has equal expected value (1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, 1/3 chance of tying).\n5. However, research suggests that in the first round, people tend to choose rock slightly more frequently than other options.\n6.

However, at some point, even the most persistent player might change strategy after so many losses.\n11. If they finally switch, they would most likely play rock to counter my scissors.\n12. Given their unprecedented consistency with paper despite poor outcomes, scissors still offers the highest expected value.\n13. The overwhelming historical evidence suggests paper remains their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is a significant development - my opponent has finally played rock for the first time after 11 rounds.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 8 times, scissors 3 times, rock 1 time.\n5. They broke their seven-round paper streak, likely because they finally realized I was exploiting their pattern.\n6. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with rock since it was successful\n   - Return to their paper bias\n   - Try scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their rock\n7. Given their demonstrated preference for paper throughout the game, there's a reasonable chance they'll return to it.\n8. However, they've now shown they can adapt (albeit slowly), so rock might also be repeated.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would be my best response.\n10. If they return to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n11. If they try scissors, rock would be best.\n12. Since they've shown such a strong paper bias throughout the game, and just broke that pattern for one round, they're most likely to either:\n    - Return to their comfort zone (paper)\n    - Stay with their winning move (rock)\n13.

My opponent has now played rock twice in a row again.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 10 times, scissors 3 times, rock 7 times.\n5. We've had another tie with rock.\n6. After ties, players often:\n   - Try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's next move\n   - Sometimes stick with the same move, expecting the opponent to change\n   - Sometimes change to what beats the previous move\n7. Given my opponent's demonstrated pattern of sticking with moves for extended periods, there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n8. Their historical pattern suggests they might continue with rock for several more rounds regardless of outcomes.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would be optimal.\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would be best.\n12. Considering their established pattern of persistence with moves and the recent sequence, paper seems like the strongest choice to counter their likely rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has now switched from rock back to paper.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 11 times, scissors 3 times, rock 7 times.\n5. We've had another tie, this time with paper.\n6. After ties, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's next move.\n7. Given my opponent's demonstrated pattern of switching between moves in chunks, they might:\n   - Continue with paper for several rounds\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper again\n   - Return to rock, following their pattern of rotation\n8. Based on their historical pattern, when they switch to a move, they tend to stick with it for multiple rounds.\n9. Since they just switched to paper, there's a good chance they'll play paper again.\n10. If they play paper again, scissors would be my best counter.\n11. If they switch to scissors, rock would be optimal.\n12. If they switch to rock, paper would be best.\n13.

My opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n3. My opponent has now switched from rock to scissors.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 13 times, scissors 5 times, rock 9 times.\n5. They've lost with scissors against my rock in the last round.\n6. After losing, players typically:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Avoid repeating the move that just lost\n7. Since they lost with scissors against my rock, they're likely to switch to paper to beat my rock.\n8. Their recent pattern has been switching moves after each round, especially after losing.\n9. In the last 7 rounds, they've gone: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, showing a possible cyclic pattern.\n10. If they switch to paper as expected, scissors would be my best counter.\n11. If they surprisingly stick with scissors despite losing, rock would win again.\n12. If they switch to rock, paper would be best.\n13. Given their recent pattern of frequent switches after losses and the apparent cyclic pattern they're showing, scissors seems like the strongest choice to counter their probable paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step.

In a single round with no history, each move has equal expected value (1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, 1/3 chance of tying).\n5. However, research suggests that in the first round, people tend to choose rock slightly more frequently than other options.\n6.

Since I have no information about my opponent's patterns, I should start with a random selection.\n4. However, there are some psychological factors to consider:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move for many players (studies show approximately 35% of first moves are rock)\n   - Paper would be a good counter to rock if my opponent follows this tendency\n5.

Studies suggest that rock is the most common first move many players choose, with paper being second most common.\n5. Given this, playing paper would give me a slight edge if my opponent follows typical patterns.\n6. However, if my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n7.

I need to consider what this might tell me about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They might favor scissors as their preferred opening move\n   - They might be anticipating that I would choose paper (which many players do in opening rounds)\n   - They might be using a random strategy and just happened to play scissors\n3.

Since my opponent won with scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to stick with winning moves.\n5. If they follow this tendency, they might play scissors again.\n6.

If they play rock, my best response would be paper.\n10. However, they might also recognize their pattern and deliberately avoid being predictable.\n11.

This suggests either:\n   - A strong bias toward playing paper\n   - A deliberate strategy to make me overcommit to scissors\n   - Limited strategic adaptation\n7. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Finally break the paper streak and switch to rock to beat my potential scissors\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play rock thinking they'll play rock\n   - Continue with paper despite the losses (based on their pattern so far)\n8. Given their unusual commitment to paper despite repeated losses, they might finally switch to rock.\n9. If they switch to rock, my best counter would be paper.\n10. However, if they continue their paper streak or switch to scissors, paper would result in a tie or loss.\n11. This is a difficult prediction point due to the opponent's unusual pattern.\n12.

After losing with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Try scissors to beat my potential paper play\n   - Return to paper, their most frequent historical choice\n   - Continue with rock despite the loss\n7. Given their demonstrated tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds (7 papers in a row, now 2 rocks in a row), they might continue with rock despite losing.\n8. However, they've also shown they can adapt after repeated losses.\n9. Since they just lost with rock against my paper, and previously showed a pattern of repeating moves despite losses, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (consistent with their pattern persistence)\n   - Switch to scissors (most logical counter to my paper)\n10. Given their history of slow adaptation and tendency to repeat moves, scissors seems like the strongest choice to counter their likely paper or rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, after two consecutive losses with rock against paper, they might finally switch to scissors to counter my paper.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would be best.\n11. If they return to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n12. Considering their established pattern of extreme persistence with moves and my success with paper against their rock, I need to balance:\n    - Their historical persistence (suggesting they might play rock again)\n    - The increasing probability they'll finally adapt after multiple losses\n13. Given that they've now lost twice with rock against paper, the probability they'll switch to scissors has increased significantly.\n14. Rock would be the safest play to counter their potential scissors switch while only resulting in a tie if they persist with rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they switch to scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would be best.\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n12.

If they stay with paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n9. If they switch to scissors, rock would be best.\n10. If they switch to rock, paper would be optimal.\n11.

My opponent has switched back to rock after two rounds of paper.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 10 times, scissors 3 times, rock 6 times.\n5. They've lost with rock against my paper in the last round.\n6. After losing, players typically:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Avoid repeating the move that just lost\n7. Since they lost with rock against my paper, they're likely to switch to scissors to beat my paper.\n8. However, they've shown unusual persistence with moves and have played rock multiple times despite losing with it.\n9. Given their established pattern and recent behavior, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (logical counter to my paper)\n   - Return to paper (going back to their most frequent move)\n   - Stick with rock despite losing (as they've done before)\n10. If they switch to scissors as expected, rock would be my best counter.\n11. If they return to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n12. If they stick with rock, paper would win again.\n13. Considering their likely adaptation after a loss and the psychological factors at play, rock seems like the strongest choice to counter their probable scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"
