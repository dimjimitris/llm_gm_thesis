    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

There are several potential strategies I could use:\n   - Play rock to counter their previous scissors (assuming they might play scissors again)\n   - Play scissors, anticipating they might switch to paper (a common pattern after winning)\n   - Play paper, thinking they might go to rock (if they're trying to be unpredictable)\n4. Since my opponent won with scissors, there's a psychological tendency for players to stick with winning moves.\n5. If they follow this tendency, they might play scissors again.\n6. Therefore, rock would be a strong counter to their potential scissors play.\n7.

This is truly remarkable - my opponent has now played paper SEVEN times in a row.\n4. Their overall distribution is: paper 8 times, scissors 3 times, rock 0 times.\n5. They have never played rock in any round.\n6. I've now won with scissors against their paper 5 times out of 5 attempts.\n7. Despite these repeated losses to scissors, they continue to play paper.\n8. This behavior defies conventional game theory and suggests either:\n   - A programmed bot with a strong paper bias\n   - A player with an unusual strategy or limited understanding of the game\n9. The probability they'll play paper again remains extremely high based on their demonstrated behavior.\n10. However, at some point, even the most persistent player might change strategy after so many losses.\n11. If they finally switch, they would most likely play rock to counter my scissors.\n12. Given their unprecedented consistency with paper despite poor outcomes, scissors still offers the highest expected value.\n13. The overwhelming historical evidence suggests paper remains their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is a significant development - my opponent has finally played rock for the first time after 11 rounds.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 8 times, scissors 3 times, rock 1 time.\n5. They broke their seven-round paper streak, likely because they finally realized I was exploiting their pattern.\n6. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with rock since it was successful\n   - Return to their paper bias\n   - Try scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their rock\n7. Given their demonstrated preference for paper throughout the game, there's a reasonable chance they'll return to it.\n8. However, they've now shown they can adapt (albeit slowly), so rock might also be repeated.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would be my best response.\n10. If they return to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n11. If they try scissors, rock would be best.\n12. Since they've shown such a strong paper bias throughout the game, and just broke that pattern for one round, they're most likely to either:\n    - Return to their comfort zone (paper)\n    - Stay with their winning move (rock)\n13.

My opponent has now switched back to rock after playing paper twice.\n4. Their overall distribution is now: paper 10 times, scissors 3 times, rock 6 times.\n5. They've lost with rock against my paper in the last round.\n6. After losing, players typically:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Avoid repeating the move that just lost\n7. Since they lost with rock against my paper, they're likely to switch to scissors to beat my paper.\n8. However, they've shown an unusual persistence with moves and have played rock multiple times despite losing with it.\n9. Their pattern seems to be sticking with a move for several rounds before switching, regardless of outcomes.\n10. If they switch to scissors as expected, rock would be my best counter.\n11. If they surprisingly stick with rock despite losing, paper would win again.\n12. If they switch to paper, scissors would be best.\n13. Considering their likely adaptation after a loss and the fact that they've now lost with rock against paper multiple times, rock seems like the strongest choice to counter their probable scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given my opponent's demonstrated pattern of sticking with moves for extended periods, there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n8. Their historical pattern suggests they might continue with rock for several more rounds regardless of outcomes.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n10.
