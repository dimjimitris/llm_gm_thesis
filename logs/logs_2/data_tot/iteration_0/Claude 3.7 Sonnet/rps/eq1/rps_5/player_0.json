Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If my opponent is now deliberately breaking patterns, they might try to be unpredictable.\n7. However, after playing rock twice in a row, there's a psychological tendency to avoid playing the same move three times consecutively.\n8. This suggests they're more likely to play either paper or scissors in the next round.\n9. Between those two options, paper is statistically more common than scissors in many studies of RPS play.\n10.

My opponent has now played rock three times in a row (rounds 5, 6, and 7).\n3. This represents a significant pattern shift from their earlier behavior.\n4. Playing the same move three times consecutively is unusual and suggests either:\n   - A deliberate strategy to stick with rock\n   - They've recognized I'm trying to predict their moves and are countering\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern to mislead me\n5. After three consecutive rocks, there's an extremely strong psychological pressure to change moves.\n6. Additionally, they've just won with rock, which might give them confidence to continue with it.\n7. However, the probability of someone playing the same move four times in a row is statistically very low.\n8. If they do change from rock, paper would be the most likely next move in the sequence.\n9.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n2. My prediction was correct - they played scissors, and I won with rock.\n3. I've now won 4 consecutive rounds, showing my strategy is working well.\n4. My opponent's latest sequence shows: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. This completes a full cycle of the three possible moves.\n6. After losing with scissors, and having lost several rounds in a row, they're likely to make a significant strategy change.\n7. Looking at the overall pattern of their moves:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n8. They've shown a preference for rock historically, and might return to it under pressure.\n9. After three consecutive losses, there's a psychological tendency to return to one's \"comfort move\" or most familiar strategy.\n10. They might also try to break their losing streak by countering my previous winning move (rock) with paper.\n11. Given that I've successfully predicted their last few moves, they might try something unexpected.\n12. Weighing all factors, I think they're most likely to play paper, either as a direct counter to my rock or as part of continuing their cycle.\n13. To counter paper, my optimal move would be scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's latest sequence shows: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n5. This repeats the same cycle as before (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n6. After losing 5 consecutive rounds, they're likely feeling frustrated and may make a dramatic strategy change.\n7. However, they seem to be following a consistent pattern that they either can't break or aren't aware of.\n8. If they continue the established cycle, they would play rock next.\n9. They might also try to break their pattern deliberately to avoid being predictable.\n10. After losing with paper to my scissors, they might choose rock to beat my expected scissors.\n11.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 26: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 27: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n2. My prediction was correct again - they played paper, and I won with scissors.\n3. I've now won 20 consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves.\n4. My opponent's latest sequence continues to show: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n5. This maintains their perfectly consistent cycle pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 etc.\n6. If they continue this pattern, they should play rock next.\n7. Despite losing 20 consecutive rounds, they've shown absolute consistency in following their pattern.\n8. This extraordinary level of pattern adherence despite repeated losses confirms they are either following a predetermined sequence or are completely unaware of their pattern.\n9. At this point, it seems virtually certain they will continue with rock, as they've shown no adaptation whatsoever despite extended consecutive losses.\n10. To counter rock, my optimal move would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
