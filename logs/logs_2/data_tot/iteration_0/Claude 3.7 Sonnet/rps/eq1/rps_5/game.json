Additionally, if they're thinking I might play rock again after our tie, they would choose paper to beat rock.\n11.

My opponent has now played rock three times in a row (rounds 5, 6, and 7).\n3. This represents a significant pattern shift from their earlier behavior.\n4. Playing the same move three times consecutively is unusual and suggests either:\n   - A deliberate strategy to stick with rock\n   - They've recognized I'm trying to predict their moves and are countering\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern to mislead me\n5. After three consecutive rocks, there's an extremely strong psychological pressure to change moves.\n6. Additionally, they've just won with rock, which might give them confidence to continue with it.\n7. However, the probability of someone playing the same move four times in a row is statistically very low.\n8. If they do change from rock, paper would be the most likely next move in the sequence.\n9. Given all factors, I think it's more likely they'll finally change from rock, with paper being the most probable choice.\n10.

After losing with scissors, and having lost several rounds in a row, they're likely to make a significant strategy change.\n7.

They've shown a preference for rock historically, and might return to it under pressure.\n9.

To counter paper, my optimal move would be scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's latest sequence shows: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n5. This repeats the same cycle as before (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n6. After losing 5 consecutive rounds, they're likely feeling frustrated and may make a dramatic strategy change.\n7. However, they seem to be following a consistent pattern that they either can't break or aren't aware of.\n8. If they continue the established cycle, they would play rock next.\n9. They might also try to break their pattern deliberately to avoid being predictable.\n10. After losing with paper to my scissors, they might choose rock to beat my expected scissors.\n11.

I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we haven't played before and I don't have any prior knowledge of their strategy or patterns.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of winning, 1/3 probability of losing, and 1/3 probability of tying.\n\n3. Since I don't have information about the other player's tendencies, I need to make an unpredictable move.\n\n4. Some studies suggest that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often. Paper might give a slight statistical edge.\n\n5. However, without concrete data on this specific opponent, I should focus on being unpredictable myself.\n\n6. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it's a reasonable first move that will win against rock (the slightly more common first move) and lose against scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given they've played scissors twice in a row with success in the last round, there's a good chance they'll stick with it or switch to rock anticipating my counter.\n\n7. Playing rock would be a good counter to their potential scissors play, and would tie if they switch to rock.\n\n8. The risk is that they might anticipate this and play paper, but given their recent success with scissors, I think that's less likely.\n\n9.

If this pattern continues, they would play scissors next.\n5. However, my opponent has lost twice in a row now, which might cause them to break their pattern and be more unpredictable.\n6. After consecutive losses, players often resort to playing rock (a psychologically \"strong\" move) or might try to anticipate what I'll play next.\n7. Since I've won with paper, my opponent might think I'll play paper again (sticking with a winner), in which case they'd play scissors.\n8. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock, so they might play paper to counter that.\n9. This is becoming a deeper mind game, but based on the pattern and psychological factors, I believe scissors is the most likely move from my opponent.\n10. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

However, I've now won twice in a row, which might cause them to break their pattern deliberately.\n7. They might realize I've identified their pattern and try something unexpected.\n8. But since I have strong evidence of a pattern and no indication they're aware I've spotted it, I should play based on the pattern prediction.\n9. To counter their likely scissors play, my optimal move would be rock.\n10.

However, they've now lost twice in a row, which might cause them to break their pattern deliberately.\n7.

Still, the most concrete evidence I have is the consistent pattern they've shown throughout all five rounds.\n9. If they play scissors as the pattern suggests, my best counter would be rock.\n10.

My opponent finally broke their streak of playing rock and switched to scissors.\n3. This confirms my prediction that they would eventually change their move.\n4. My opponent's overall pattern has become less predictable over time.\n5. After a tie with scissors, common strategies include:\n   - Playing rock to beat the anticipated repeated scissors\n   - Playing scissors again expecting the opponent to switch\n   - Playing paper to beat anticipated rock (if they think you'll try to beat their scissors)\n6. The most straightforward response after a scissors tie is for my opponent to play rock.\n7. However, this game has featured many ties, suggesting my opponent and I may be using similar strategic thinking.\n8. To break this pattern, I should consider what move would be least expected.\n9. If my opponent expects me to play rock to beat their scissors, they might play paper to counter.\n10. Therefore, scissors would be effective against their potential paper play.\n11. However, this is getting into multiple levels of prediction, which becomes less reliable.\n12. Given the overall pattern and the most common response after a scissors tie, rock is my safest choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Their pattern has become less predictable in the later rounds.\n5. After a tie with scissors, common strategies include:\n   - Sticking with scissors, thinking the opponent will change\n   - Switching to rock to beat the expected scissors repeat\n   - Switching to paper, expecting the opponent to switch to rock\n6. Given that my opponent just broke a long streak of playing rock, they might be less likely to immediately jump to rock.\n7. There's also a common tendency to avoid repeating the same move after a tie.\n8. If they expect me to play rock (to beat their previous scissors), they might play paper.\n9. However, considering their historical preference for rock (played 4 out of 8 rounds), they might return to their \"comfort move.\"\n10. Weighing all factors, I think they're slightly more likely to play paper than rock, and least likely to repeat scissors.\n11. To counter paper, my optimal move would be scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

My opponent's latest sequence shows: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. This follows the classic cycle of rock-paper-scissors, suggesting they might continue the pattern with paper next.\n6. After three consecutive losses, my opponent is likely to significantly change their strategy.\n7. They might be noticing that I'm successfully predicting their moves and try something unexpected.\n8. At this point, my opponent might believe I'll expect them to play paper (continuing their cycle), so they might deliberately break the pattern.\n9. They might also try to counter my previous winning move (rock) by playing paper.\n10. Given that they've lost with scissors, they're unlikely to play scissors again immediately.\n11. Between rock and paper, paper is more likely because:\n    - It beats my previous move (rock)\n    - It would continue their observed cycle\n    - It's a logical choice after losing with scissors\n12.

If they continue this cycle, paper would be their next logical move.\n7. However, they've now lost three rounds in a row, which would typically trigger a significant strategy change.\n8. After multiple consecutive losses, players often break patterns and may even revert to their \"comfort move\" (which for this opponent appears to be rock).\n9. They might also attempt to directly counter my previous winning move (rock) by playing paper.\n10. Given their tendency to play rock when uncertain (5 times out of 11 rounds), combined with the psychological pressure to break their losing streak, there's a reasonable chance they'll return to rock.\n11.

This suggests they may be following a paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle.\n8. If this pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n9.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 26: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 27: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 28: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 29: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n2. My prediction was correct again - they played scissors, and I won with rock.\n3. I've now won 22 consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves.\n4. My opponent's latest sequence continues to show: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. This maintains their perfectly consistent cycle pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc.\n6. If they continue this pattern, they should play paper next.\n7. Despite losing 22 consecutive rounds, they've shown absolute consistency in following their pattern.\n8. This extraordinary level of pattern adherence despite repeated losses confirms they are either following a predetermined sequence or are completely unaware of their pattern.\n9. At this point, it seems virtually certain they will continue with paper, as they've shown no adaptation whatsoever despite extended consecutive losses.\n10.
