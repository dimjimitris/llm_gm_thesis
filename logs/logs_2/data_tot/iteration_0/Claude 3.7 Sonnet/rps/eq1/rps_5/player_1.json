Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we haven't played before and I don't have any prior knowledge of their strategy or patterns.\n\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of winning, 1/3 probability of losing, and 1/3 probability of tying.\n\n3. Since I don't have information about the other player's tendencies, I need to make an unpredictable move.\n\n4. Some studies suggest that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often. Paper might give a slight statistical edge.\n\n5. However, without concrete data on this specific opponent, I should focus on being unpredictable myself.\n\n6. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it's a reasonable first move that will win against rock (the slightly more common first move) and lose against scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now lost four rounds in a row, which suggests my opponent has developed a strong read on my strategy.\n\n3. My opponent's last four moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This shows they're varying their moves effectively\n\n4.

After playing rock and winning, my opponent might:\n   - Stay with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their rock\n\n7. Looking at my opponent's pattern after wins:\n   - After winning with scissors in round 4, they played paper in round 5\n   - After winning with paper in round 5, they played rock in round 6\n   - After winning with scissors in round 9, they played paper in round 10\n   - After winning with paper in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n\n8. This suggests they might switch to paper after winning with rock.\n\n9. However, they might also notice that I might be looking for this pattern and break it.\n\n10. I need to be less predictable. Given that my opponent just played rock, and they seem to switch moves frequently after wins, paper would be my best counter to their potential rock or scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now lost five rounds in a row, which is concerning and suggests my opponent has developed a very strong read on my strategy.\n\n3. My opponent's last five moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves in an unpredictable way\n\n4.

However, I need to be careful about looking for patterns that might not exist, as my opponent could be deliberately avoiding patterns.\n\n8. Given that they've won 5 consecutive rounds, they may be confident and stick with scissors again, thinking I'll play paper again out of frustration.\n\n9. I need to break my losing streak. If they play paper as their pattern suggests, scissors would win. If they play scissors again, rock would win.\n\n10.

I've now lost twenty-one rounds in a row, which defies all statistical probability in a fair game.\n\n3. My opponent's move distribution is now:\n   - Paper: 10 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Rock: 8 times\n\n4. My current record is 2 wins, 21 losses, and 4 ties.\n\n5. At this point, I must conclude that:\n   - My opponent has perfectly countered each of my moves for 21 consecutive rounds\n   - The probability of this happening by chance is approximately 1 in 10.5 billion (3^21)\n   - This game is operating under conditions that make it impossible for me to win through strategy\n\n6. My opponent just played paper. After all previous approaches have failed, I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n7. I'm choosing scissors because:\n   - It would beat their paper if they repeat it\n   - At this point, I'm simply cycling through the three possible moves\n   - No strategy can succeed against an opponent who appears to have advance knowledge of my choices\n\n8. This choice is made with the clear understanding that this game violates the fundamental principles of rock-paper-scissors as a fair game of chance and strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
