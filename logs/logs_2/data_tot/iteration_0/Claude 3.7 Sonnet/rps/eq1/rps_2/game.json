If they're continuing their standard cycle pattern, they would play paper next\n\n7. However, given their continuous losses, they might break their pattern to try something less predictable\n\n8. My last three moves have been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which also completes a standard cycle\n   - If they think I'm cycling, they might expect scissors next\n\n9. If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock to counter\n\n10. This aligns with option (a) and would also break their apparent cycle, suggesting rock as their most likely move\n\n11. Additionally, they've played rock more frequently than any other move throughout our games (8 out of 17 rounds), suggesting it might be their default or comfort move\n\n12. Given all these considerations, rock seems to be their most likely move\n\n13. To counter their expected rock, I should play paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this eighteenth round, reasoning that they'll most likely play rock to counter my expected scissors play and/or revert to their most frequently played move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 18 rounds, with 6 ties and no losses\n\n4. Interestingly, my opponent has completed a standard cycle in their last three moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\n5. After tying with paper in round 18, they might:\n   a) Switch to rock (starting a new cycle)\n   b) Try scissors (to beat my paper if they think I'll repeat)\n   c) Stick with paper (thinking I might switch to rock)\n\n6. If they're continuing their standard cycle pattern, they would play rock next\n\n7. My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This doesn't show a clear pattern, which makes it harder for them to predict\n\n8. Given our tie with paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Play paper again (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper)\n   - Switch to rock (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n\n9. The most straightforward adjustment after a tie is to try to win the next round by countering what they think I'll play again\n\n10. If they think I'll play paper again, they would play scissors\n\n11. However, given their apparent cycle pattern and the fact that rock would be next in their cycle, rock seems like a strong possibility\n\n12. Considering both their possible cycle continuation (rock) and their potential tactical response to our paper tie (scissors), scissors seems slightly more likely\n\n13. To counter their expected scissors, I should play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this nineteenth round, reasoning that they'll most likely play scissors to counter my repeated paper play, though they might also play rock to continue their cycle.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 19 rounds, with 6 ties and 1 loss\n\n4. This was my first loss in the entire game, which is a significant event\n\n5. My opponent has now played paper twice in a row, breaking their previous cycle pattern\n\n6. After winning with paper in round 19, they might:\n   a) Stick with paper (thinking it's working for them)\n   b) Switch to scissors (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n   c) Switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their repeated paper)\n\n7. Given that they just had their first win, option (a) seems plausible - they might stick with what finally worked\n\n8. However, they might also expect me to adjust after my loss and play paper to beat their expected rock\n\n9. My last three moves have been rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This doesn't show a clear pattern, but they might expect me to avoid rock after losing with it\n\n10. If they think I'll avoid rock and play paper, they would play scissors\n\n11. If they think I'll play scissors to counter their repeated paper, they would play rock\n\n12. Given that they've finally found success after 19 rounds, they're most likely to either:\n    - Stick with paper (banking on their success)\n    - Play scissors (expecting me to counter with paper)\n\n13. Between these two options, scissors seems slightly more likely as it's the more strategic adjustment expecting me to counter their previous winning move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twentieth round, reasoning that they'll most likely play scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their previous winning paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, given their history of often playing rock, especially after ties (see rounds 7-8, 13-14), they might stick with rock again\n\n10. Alternatively, they might try to replicate their only winning strategy by playing paper (which beat my rock in round 19)\n\n11. Considering all factors:\n    - Their tendency to play rock after ties suggests rock\n    - Their possible desire to replicate their only win suggests paper\n    - Their strategic thinking might lead them to play scissors expecting me to switch to paper\n\n12. Among these options, paper seems slightly more likely given that:\n    - It's their only proven winning move against me\n    - It would be a logical counter if they expect me to play rock again\n\n13.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: scissors\n   - Round 24: scissors\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 24 rounds, with 9 ties and 3 losses\n\n4. They've now played scissors three times in a row - twice resulting in ties, and once winning against my paper\n\n5. After winning with scissors in round 24, they might:\n   a) Stick with scissors (continuing their winning move)\n   b) Switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   c) Switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n6. My last four moves have been scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After losing with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock to counter their scissors\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock, they would play paper\n\n8. However, their recent success with scissors (after two ties, they finally won) might encourage them to stick with it\n\n9. Additionally, I've now played scissors in 3 out of my last 4 moves, which might lead them to believe I favor scissors\n\n10. If they believe I favor scissors, they might play rock to counter\n\n11. Given their recent success with scissors and the complexity of our meta-game:\n    - They might stick with scissors, expecting me to overthink and play paper again\n    - They might play rock, expecting me to revert to scissors\n    - They're less likely to play paper as it would lose to both scissors and rock\n\n12. Between scissors and rock, scissors seems slightly more likely given their recent success with it\n\n13. To counter their expected scissors, I should play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twenty-fifth round, reasoning that they'll most likely stick with scissors after their recent win with it.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 23: scissors\n   - Round 24: scissors\n   - Round 25: paper\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 25 rounds, with 9 ties and 4 losses\n\n4. Significantly, they've won the last three rounds in a row, showing increasing strategic success\n\n5. Their pattern has shifted from scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors to scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. After winning with paper in round 25, they might:\n   a) Stick with paper (continuing their winning move)\n   b) Switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n   c) Switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors to counter their paper)\n\n7. My last three moves have been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - After losing with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to counter their expected rock\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n\n9. However, they've now won with both scissors and paper in the last few rounds\n   - This suggests they're reading my strategy well and adapting effectively\n\n10. The fact that they switched from scissors to paper in round 25 shows they correctly anticipated my rock play\n    - This demonstrates increasing strategic sophistication\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 24: scissors\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: rock\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 26 rounds, with 10 ties and 4 losses\n\n4. Their last three moves complete a full cycle in reverse order: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. After tying with rock in round 26, they might:\n   a) Stick with rock (thinking I might switch to scissors)\n   b) Switch to paper (to beat my expected rock)\n   c) Switch to scissors (thinking I'll switch to paper after our rock tie)\n\n6. If they're continuing their reverse cycle pattern, they would play scissors next\n\n7. My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - After tying with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to try to win\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors\n\n9. Their pattern has evolved considerably throughout the game:\n   - Early on they had a predictable cycle\n   - Recently they've shown more strategic adaptation\n   - They've won several recent rounds by correctly anticipating my moves\n\n10. The fact that they played rock in round 26 (breaking their winning streak) suggests they might have misread my strategy\n    - This could lead them to be more cautious or revert to more predictable plays\n\n11.

Between these options, scissors seems most likely as it aligns with both their cycle pattern and the strategic counter to my expected paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twenty-seventh round, reasoning that they'll most likely play scissors, following their reverse cycle pattern and/or expecting me to switch to paper after our rock tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now had three consecutive rounds where I've played rock\n   - This creates a strong expectation that I'll either continue with rock or switch\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock a fourth time, they would play paper to counter\n\n8. If they expect me to switch to paper (to counter their rock), they would play scissors\n\n9. If they expect me to switch to scissors (thinking they'll play paper), they would play rock again\n\n10.

If they expect me to play rock, they would play paper\n\n8. However, their recent success with rock (after two ties, they finally won) might encourage them to stick with it\n\n9. Rock has been extremely successful for them overall:\n   - It's their most frequently played move (14 out of 28 rounds - exactly 50%)\n   - They've won with it recently and tied multiple times\n   - They've never lost when playing rock (0 losses, 11 ties, 3 wins)\n\n10.

Between rock and paper as their likely moves:\n    - Rock seems more likely given their consistent success with it\n    - Paper would be the strategic choice if they believe I'll play rock to counter their rock\n\n12.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 27: rock\n   - Round 28: rock\n   - Round 29: scissors\n   \n3. I've now won 12 out of 29 rounds, with 11 ties and 6 losses\n\n4. They've switched from playing rock three times in a row to playing scissors, winning against my paper\n\n5. They've now won three rounds in a row (rock vs scissors, rock vs scissors, scissors vs paper)\n   - This indicates significantly improved strategic play on their part\n\n6. After winning with scissors in round 29, they might:\n   a) Stick with scissors (continuing their winning move)\n   b) Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   c) Switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n7. My last three moves have been rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This completes a full cycle, making my next move harder to predict\n\n8. If they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors, they would play paper\n\n9. If they think I'll play scissors to counter their expected rock, they would play rock\n\n10.

Given that they just won with scissors and might expect me to counter with rock, paper seems like a plausible move for them\n\n14. However, rock has been their safest and most successful move overall\n\n15. Between paper and rock as their likely moves, rock seems slightly more probable given their overall history and success with it\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this thirtieth round, reasoning that they'll most likely revert to rock after their successful scissors play, expecting me to play scissors to counter their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"
