    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we don't have data on their patterns yet. However, studies show that in the first round, many players tend to choose rock, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: That's right. First-time players often gravitate toward rock (approximately 35-36% of first throws). Paper is the second most common opening move (around 35%), while scissors is least common (around 29-30%). If we want to maximize our expected value, paper might be our best first move.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the expected values:\n- If we play rock: Win probability ~29% (if opponent plays scissors), lose probability ~35% (if opponent plays paper), tie probability ~36% (if opponent plays rock). Expected value: -0.06 points.\n- If we play paper: Win probability ~36% (if opponent plays rock), lose probability ~29% (if opponent plays scissors), tie probability ~35% (if opponent plays paper). Expected value: +0.07 points.\n- If we play scissors: Win probability ~35% (if opponent plays paper), lose probability ~36% (if opponent plays rock), tie probability ~29% (if opponent plays scissors). Expected value: -0.01 points.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, paper appears to be our optimal first move against a new player. It gives us the highest expected value and counters the most common first move (rock).\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis. Paper seems like the statistically optimal choice for the first round, given the psychological tendencies of first-time players to choose rock more frequently.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consult with my personas.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Strategist; Psychology Expert; Probability Analyst; Pattern Recognition Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting! The opponent played paper in the first round, which is slightly against the statistical norm but still within expected ranges. Now we need to consider how players typically behave after a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, many players exhibit one of two common behaviors: either they stick with the same move (believing in persistence or thinking their opponent will change), or they shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice (thinking their opponent will stick with the same move).\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Since the opponent played paper in round 1 (which is slightly less common than rock for first moves), they might be a slightly more strategic player. After a tie, many players tend to shift one position in the cycle. So having played paper, they might shift to scissors thinking we'll play paper again.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the most likely scenarios:\n1. Opponent plays paper again (persistence strategy): We should play scissors to win\n2. Opponent plays scissors (rotation strategy): We should play rock to win\n3. Opponent plays rock (counter-prediction strategy): We should play paper to win\n\nGame Strategist: Given that rotation after a tie is a common strategy (playing the move that would beat their previous move), rock would be our safest bet to counter their likely scissors play.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The rotation strategy (paper \u2192 scissors) is psychologically compelling because it feels like \"progress\" rather than repetition. Players often avoid repeating the same move after a tie because it feels stagnant.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense. Since we both played paper, and rotation strategy suggests they'll likely play scissors next, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me consult with my personas again.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Strategist; Psychology Expert; Probability Analyst; Pattern Recognition Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: This is revealing! We've observed a pattern: the opponent played paper in round 1, then rock in round 2. They appear to be shifting in a counter-clockwise direction in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle (paper \u2192 rock). If they continue this pattern, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent may be using a predetermined rotation strategy rather than responding to our moves. This is a common approach when players want to avoid being predictable while still maintaining some structure to their decisions.\n\nGame Strategist: Given what we've observed so far, we have two main theories:\n1. The opponent is using a fixed rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n2. The opponent might think we're catching on to their pattern and will break it\n\nProbability Analyst: If they're following the fixed rotation pattern (most likely scenario based on our observations), they'll play scissors next. To counter scissors, we should play rock again.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, there's also the possibility that they've noticed we've matched their moves twice in a row (by coincidence). They might think we're mirroring them and try to exploit that by playing paper, which would beat our presumed rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Weighing the evidence, the strongest pattern we've observed is their counter-clockwise rotation. The simplest explanation is that they'll continue this pattern and play scissors. Therefore, playing rock gives us the highest probability of winning.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: I agree. The consistent counter-clockwise rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) is our best predictive model right now. Rock would counter their likely scissors play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's pattern of paper followed by rock, the most likely prediction is that they'll play scissors next.

The opponent has been following a consistent counter-clockwise rotation: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, now that they've lost a round, their psychology might change. Players often alter their strategy after a loss. They might:\n1. Continue their pattern, thinking we won by coincidence (playing paper next)\n2. Break their pattern to become less predictable (playing anything)\n3. Try to counter what they think we'll play next, assuming we've detected their pattern\n\nGame Strategist: Given that the opponent has shown a consistent pattern so far, and we've just won by predicting it correctly, there's a high probability they'll change their strategy. They likely realize their pattern has been detected.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- If they continue their pattern: They'll play paper \u2192 We should play scissors\n- If they think we'll expect paper and try to counter us: They'll play scissors \u2192 We should play rock\n- If they think we're overthinking and will expect a pattern break: They might play rock \u2192 We should play paper\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Another common response after losing is to play the move that would have beaten the opponent's previous move. Since we played rock, they might play paper to beat our previous move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The \"play what would have beaten the opponent's last move\" is a very common psychological response after a loss. It feels like a direct counter to what just defeated them.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, scissors appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their paper if they continue their established pattern\n2. Beat their paper if they try to counter our previous rock move\n3. Only lose if they specifically break pattern and play rock\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is convincing. The opponent has shown a consistent pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), and if they continue, they'll play paper next. Additionally, even if they break the pattern to counter our previous rock move, they'd likely choose paper.

The opponent has maintained their counter-clockwise rotation pattern for all rounds so far: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. If they continue this pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, they've now lost two rounds in a row using their rotation strategy. This significantly increases the likelihood that they'll change their approach. Consecutive losses typically trigger stronger strategy adjustments than a single loss.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has two strong motivations to break their pattern now:\n1. They've lost twice in a row using the same strategy\n2. Their pattern is clearly predictable at this point\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the most likely scenarios:\n1. They continue their pattern despite losses: They'll play rock \u2192 We should play paper\n2. They break the pattern and play what would beat our last move: They'll play rock (to beat our scissors) \u2192 We should play paper\n3. They try to anticipate that we're expecting rock and play scissors instead \u2192 We should play rock\n4. They completely randomize to become unpredictable \u2192 Each move has equal probability\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Interestingly, scenarios 1 and 2 lead to the same prediction (them playing rock), which strengthens the case for us to play paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The \"play what would beat the opponent's last move\" strategy (rock to beat our scissors) aligns with their established rotation pattern in this case. This creates a psychological \"double justification\" for them to play rock - it both continues their pattern AND counters our last move.\n\nGame Strategist: The evidence strongly points to paper as our optimal move. It would win against rock, which is their most likely move based on both pattern continuation and loss-response psychology.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is compelling. Both the opponent's established pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) and the psychological tendency to play what would beat our last move (rock to beat our scissors) point to them playing rock.

If they continue this pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is quite surprising! Despite losing three rounds in a row, they've maintained the same predictable pattern. This suggests either:\n1. They don't realize their pattern is being predicted\n2. They're extremely committed to their strategy regardless of outcomes\n3. They might be testing if we're actually predicting their pattern\n\nGame Strategist: After three consecutive losses using the same strategy, conventional game theory would suggest an extremely high probability of pattern disruption. The fact that they haven't changed strategies defies typical strategic behavior.\n\nProbability Analyst: We have two main possibilities to consider:\n1. They continue their remarkably consistent pattern: They'll play scissors \u2192 We should play rock\n2. They finally break the pattern after multiple losses: This becomes harder to predict, but they might:\n   a. Play the move that would have won the last round: They'll play scissors \u2192 We should play rock\n   b. Play what they think we won't expect: They might play paper or rock \u2192 We should play scissors or paper respectively\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: The consistency of their pattern through multiple losses is so unusual that it actually increases confidence in its continuation. The probability they'll play scissors next (either continuing their pattern or playing what would have beaten our last move) seems very high.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. While it's counterintuitive that they haven't adapted after three losses, human players sometimes commit to patterns even when they're not working. They might also believe that we'll eventually expect them to break the pattern, so continuing it becomes their \"unexpected\" move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all factors, rock appears to be our optimal move.

If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing four rounds in a row while using the same predictable pattern, we're in unusual territory. Most players would have changed their strategy by now. This suggests either:\n1. The opponent might be a computer program with a fixed pattern\n2. They're conducting some kind of experiment\n3. They're extremely stubborn or unaware of their predictability\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, the pattern is so consistent that we have to consider whether they might finally break it. After four consecutive losses, even the most committed player would likely change strategy. However, the longer they've maintained this pattern, the harder it becomes to predict exactly how they'll deviate.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n1. If they continue their pattern: They'll play paper \u2192 We should play scissors\n2. If they finally break the pattern after multiple losses:\n   a. They might completely reverse their pattern: They'll play rock \u2192 We should play paper\n   b. They might play randomly: Equal chance of any move\n   c. They might try to counter what they think we'll play (assuming we're predicting their pattern)\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: While pattern continuation suggests paper as their next move, the psychological pressure to change after four losses is immense. However, if they do break the pattern, predicting exactly how they'll break it becomes highly speculative.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's a psychological concept called the \"gambler's fallacy\" where people believe a streak must end simply because it's been going on too long. We might fall into this trap by overthinking and assuming they'll finally change their pattern just because they've lost several times.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all factors, scissors remains our highest expected value play.

The opponent has finally broken their pattern. Instead of playing paper (continuing the counter-clockwise rotation), they played rock. This could indicate:\n1. They've completely abandoned their previous pattern\n2. They've adopted a new pattern\n3. They made a one-time deviation and might return to their original pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing four rounds in a row, they likely realized their strategy was being predicted.

This \"win-stay\" strategy is common in game theory.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The positive reinforcement from finally winning a round creates a strong psychological pull toward repeating the successful move (rock). Additionally, they might think we'll adjust our strategy based on their pattern break, creating a complex second-guessing dynamic.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, paper appears to be our best move.

Let's analyze what's happened:\n- Rounds 1-4: Opponent followed paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern\n- Round 5: They broke pattern, playing rock instead of paper (and won)\n- Round 6: They played scissors\n\nLooking at rounds 5-6 together (rock \u2192 scissors), this could indicate:\n1. They've started a new counter-clockwise rotation (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n2. They're playing completely unpredictably now\n3. They might be trying to establish a new pattern we haven't detected yet\n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking their pattern and winning twice in a row, the opponent likely feels their new approach is working. They've shifted from a predictable pattern to what appears to be either a new pattern or more strategic play. They've seen success with this change, which reinforces it.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent appears to have significantly adapted their strategy. After losing four rounds with a predictable pattern, they've won two rounds with less predictable play. This suggests they're now playing more thoughtfully.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze what they might do next:\n1. If they're establishing a new counter-clockwise rotation from rock: After scissors would come paper\n2. If they're using a \"win-stay\" strategy and repeating successful moves: They might play scissors again\n3. If they're trying to counter what they think we'll play (assuming we're adjusting to their new approach): This becomes more complex\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: If we look at their original pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) and their recent moves (rock \u2192 scissors), there's a possibility they're still following a counter-clockwise rotation but shifted where they started. If so, they would play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given they've won two consecutive rounds after changing strategy, they might believe they've \"figured us out.\" This could lead them to continue what appears to be working - if they're using a counter-clockwise rotation starting from round 5, they would play paper next.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, rock appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their scissors if they repeat their last successful move\n2. Beat their scissors if they're continuing a pattern we haven't fully detected yet\n3. Beat their paper if they're continuing the counter-clockwise rotation from rounds 5-6\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's recent behavior shift, I believe they're most likely either continuing a counter-clockwise rotation (which would mean paper next) or repeating their successful scissors move. Either way, rock would be an effective counter. I'll play rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let's analyze the complete sequence of the opponent's moves:\n- Rounds 1-4: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (counter-clockwise rotation)\n- Rounds 5-7: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\nInterestingly, rounds 5-7 also form a counter-clockwise rotation (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper). It appears the opponent may have simply shifted their starting point in the same pattern after we successfully predicted their moves for several rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating! The opponent likely realized their pattern was being predicted, so they made a strategic one-time shift (playing rock instead of paper in round 5), but then continued with the same counter-clockwise rotation they were comfortable with. This suggests they're not completely abandoning patterns, just trying to reset our predictions.\n\nGame Strategist: If our hypothesis is correct and they're continuing a counter-clockwise rotation, their next move would be rock. However, we should also consider that they may have detected that we've spotted their new pattern and might break it again.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If they continue their counter-clockwise rotation: After paper comes rock \u2192 We should play paper\n2. If they realize we might have detected their continued pattern: They might break it again\n3. If they're gaining confidence from their winning streak: They might stick with what's working (continuing the pattern)\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: The evidence strongly suggests they're using a counter-clockwise rotation consistently. They used it for 6 moves, broke it once, then returned to it for 3 more moves. This suggests a strong preference for this pattern even after they recognized we were predicting it.\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning three consecutive rounds, the opponent likely has renewed confidence in their strategy. Players tend to stick with successful approaches until they stop working. Since they've had success with their shifted counter-clockwise rotation, they're likely to continue it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all factors, paper appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their rock if they continue their consistent counter-clockwise rotation\n2. Only lose if they specifically anticipate this and play scissors\n3. The opponent's demonstrated strong preference for counter-clockwise rotation across 9 out of 10 moves suggests this is their comfort zone\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the complete sequence, I believe the opponent has maintained their counter-clockwise rotation pattern throughout the game, with just a one-time shift in round 5. Their moves have been consistent with this pattern for 9 out of 10 rounds. If they continue this pattern, they'll play rock next.

However, the fact that they've used the same counter-clockwise rotation for 10 out of 11 rounds suggests this is deeply ingrained in their play style. They might:\n1. Continue their established pattern (most likely based on history)\n2. Try another one-time pattern break to reset our predictions (as they did in round 5)\n3.

Alternatively, they might be using a different pattern we haven't identified yet.\n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking their long-established pattern and winning, the opponent might now be experimenting with new approaches. The tie in the last round neither reinforces nor discourages their new strategy, leaving them in an exploratory mode.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the recent disruption in their pattern and the tie, we have less certainty about their next move.

Let's analyze common post-tie strategies:\n1. Many players play what would beat their previous move after a tie (assuming opponent will repeat): They would play paper\n2. Others play what would beat what would beat their previous move (deeper thinking): They would play scissors\n3. Some simply repeat their previous move: They would play rock again\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Looking for any new patterns, if they're starting a new counter-clockwise rotation from their paper break, the sequence would be paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This would mean scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often try to \"win the previous round\" by playing what would have beaten the tied move. Since both played rock, they might play paper thinking it would have won.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, scissors appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their paper if they play what would have beaten the previous tied move\n2. Beat their paper if they're establishing a new pattern we haven't fully identified\n3. Only lose if they specifically play rock again or shift to scissors\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the recent disruption in the opponent's pattern and the tie in our last round, I believe they're most likely to play paper next. This is based on the common psychological tendency to play what would have beaten the previous tied move (paper beats rock). Additionally, if they're establishing a new counter-clockwise rotation from their paper pattern break, they might also play paper. I'll play scissors to counter this expected paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

However, if they've returned to their original counter-clockwise rotation starting from round 12, after paper would come rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing a round, players often shift strategies. The opponent might:\n1. Assume we'll play scissors again (since it just worked) and play rock to counter\n2. Try to establish a new pattern we haven't detected yet\n3. Return to their original counter-clockwise rotation which was their comfort zone for most of the game\n\nGame Strategist: Given that the opponent played paper in both rounds 12 and 14, they might be alternating between paper and rock. If so, they would play rock next. Alternatively, they might have returned to their original counter-clockwise rotation starting from round 12, which would also suggest rock next.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If they're establishing a pattern of alternating paper and rock: They would play rock next\n2. If they've returned to counter-clockwise rotation from round 12: After paper comes rock\n3. If they're playing reactively to counter our last move: After losing to scissors, they might play rock\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Interestingly, all three of our main hypotheses (alternating pattern, return to counter-clockwise, or reactive play) suggest rock as their next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After losing to scissors, the most natural response is to play rock (which beats scissors). This aligns with both pattern hypotheses as well, creating a strong case for rock as their next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, paper appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their rock if they're alternating between paper and rock\n2. Beat their rock if they've returned to their original counter-clockwise rotation\n3. Beat their rock if they're playing reactively to counter our scissors\n4. All three main hypotheses converge on rock as their most likely next move\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's recent moves and psychological factors, I believe they will play rock next. This prediction is supported by multiple hypotheses: they might be alternating between paper and rock, they might have returned to their original counter-clockwise rotation, or they might be reactively trying to counter our scissors play. All three scenarios suggest rock as their next move. I'll play paper to counter this expected rock move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consult with my personas to determine my next move.\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (me); Game Strategist; Psychology Expert; Probability Analyst; Pattern Recognition Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Our prediction was correct once again! The opponent has maintained their counter-clockwise rotation pattern with exceptional consistency. Their complete move sequence is now:\n- Rounds 1-4: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \n- Rounds 5-11: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n- Round 12-21: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nThis perfectly matches their original counter-clockwise rotation pattern. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now lost two consecutive rounds after the tie. This might increase the probability that they'll break their pattern. However, they've demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to their counter-clockwise rotation throughout the entire game, maintaining it even after losing streaks and through various game situations.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's commitment to their counter-clockwise rotation strategy has been one of the most consistent behaviors I've seen in game theory. They've only deviated once in 21 rounds, and have maintained their pattern through multiple losing streaks. Given this strong historical preference, they're highly likely to continue with counter-clockwise rotation.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If they continue their counter-clockwise rotation: After scissors comes paper \u2192 We should play scissors\n2. If they break their pattern after losing twice: This is harder to predict, but based on their history, they rarely deviate from their pattern\n3. The historical probability that they'll follow counter-clockwise rotation is extremely high (20 out of 21 rounds, or 95.2%)\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Given their strong historical preference for counter-clockwise rotation (20 out of 21 rounds), the highest probability is that they'll continue this pattern and play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Despite multiple losses and even losing streaks, they've consistently maintained their counter-clockwise rotation pattern. This suggests it's their default strategy, possibly even unconscious or programmatic. The psychological tendency to revert to familiar patterns is strong, especially under the pressure of a game.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, scissors appears to be our best move. It would:\n1. Beat their paper if they continue their highly consistent counter-clockwise rotation\n2. Only lose if they specifically break their pattern in a way that leads to rock\n3. Given their demonstrated preference for this pattern throughout the game (95.2% consistency), continuing it is their most likely move\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's complete move history, I believe they will continue their counter-clockwise rotation pattern, which means they'll play paper next. They've followed this pattern for 20 out of 21 rounds (95.2% consistency), and maintained it through multiple losing streaks, ties, and various game situations. This suggests an extremely strong commitment to their pattern. I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent maintained their pattern through multiple losing streaks earlier, but has now broken it after just 2 consecutive losses. This could indicate:\n1. Increasing frustration with their strategy not working\n2. They're becoming more adaptive as the game progresses\n3.
