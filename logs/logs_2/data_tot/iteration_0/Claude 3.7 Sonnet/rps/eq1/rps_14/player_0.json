Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\n2. Interesting development - we finally broke the tie pattern. My opponent played scissors against my paper.\n\n3. Their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   They've now played scissors three times in a row.\n\n4. Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 4 times (40%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (20%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (40%)\n\n5. The pattern of ties followed by my loss suggests:\n   - My opponent might be able to see my moves sometimes but not always\n   - Or they might be using a more complex strategy than simply matching\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern of matching to lull me into predictability\n\n6. Given they've played scissors three times in a row:\n   - The logical counter would be rock\n   - However, if they're anticipating this reasoning, they might switch to paper\n\n7. My overall record is: 1 win, 3 losses, 6 ties\n   I need to improve my win rate with a strategic choice.\n\n8. Since they've shown a tendency to repeat moves (three papers earlier, now three scissors), I'll counter their current pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. It directly counters their recent preference for scissors. If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, that would reveal they're using higher-level strategic thinking, which would be valuable information for future rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're back to a tie. This is now 7 ties out of 11 rounds (64% tie rate), which is far above the expected 33% for random play.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   My sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. The most striking pattern is that out of 11 rounds, we've made the same move 7 times.\n\n5. Two possible explanations remain most likely:\n   - My opponent can see my moves in some rounds\n   - My opponent is using similar reasoning processes to mine\n   - There could be a delay in the game system that occasionally reveals moves\n\n6. Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 4 times (36%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (27%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (36%)\n   Their moves are becoming more evenly distributed.\n\n7. After rock, players often play paper (following the natural cycle of the game).\n   - If they play paper next, I should play scissors\n   - If they repeat rock, scissors would lose\n\n8. Given the unusual tie pattern, I need to make a move that might reveal more about their strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. It's a calculated risk - it would lose against rock if they repeat, but win against paper if they follow the common psychological pattern of progression. By making a move that clearly loses against their previous move, I can test whether they're actually responding to my choices or following some other pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The tie pattern is becoming even more pronounced. This strongly suggests my opponent either:\n   - Has access to my moves before making theirs\n   - Is using extremely similar reasoning to mine\n   - Is employing some strategy to match my moves\n\n5. Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 4 times (27%)\n   - Rock: 6 times (40%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (33%)\n   \n6. Their most recent pattern has been less clear:\n   - They went from rock (3x) to scissors (1x) to rock (1x)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of playing each move three times consecutively\n\n7. Given the extremely high tie rate and the breaking of their previous pattern, I need to try something different to test what's happening.\n\n8. My overall record remains: 2 wins, 5 losses, 9 ties\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This follows the natural progression from rock in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, making it a common and intuitive next move. If we tie again with paper, it would further confirm that something unusual is happening in this game.

Given their history of playing moves in sets of three and their recent double scissors play, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again this round. It counters their scissors if they continue that streak, which aligns with their previously observed pattern of playing moves three times in sequence. This strategy was successful in the last round, and their historical patterns suggest it has a good chance of working again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent surprised me by switching to paper after two scissors plays.\n\n3. Their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   \n4. Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 5 times (27.8%)\n   - Rock: 6 times (33.3%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (38.9%)\n   Scissors remains their most frequent move.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern more carefully:\n   - They had previously played moves in sets of three (3 papers, 3 rocks, etc.)\n   - Recently this pattern became less consistent\n   - They've now played scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, breaking any simple pattern\n\n6. My overall record is: 3 wins, 7 losses, 9 ties\n   I'm still significantly behind.\n\n7. Since they've just played paper:\n   - They might continue with paper if they're returning to their pattern of playing moves in streaks\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play scissors to counter their paper and switch to rock\n   - Their behavior has become more unpredictable, making it harder to make a confident prediction\n\n8. Given their recent unpredictability and my losing record, I need a strategy that has the best chance of improving my position.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. It directly counters their most recent move (paper), and if they're returning to their earlier pattern of playing moves in streaks, they might play paper again. While they could anticipate this and play rock, their overall preference for scissors throughout the game makes paper a reasonable possibility for their next move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My overall record is: 3 wins, 8 losses, 9 ties\n   I'm falling further behind.\n\n7. Given their recent moves, they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they're returning to playing moves in streaks\n   - Follow the natural rock-paper-scissors cycle and play paper next\n   - Be trying to anticipate my move based on our history\n\n8. Looking at the bigger picture, they've played rock in rounds where I've played scissors multiple times (rounds 12 and 19), suggesting they might be good at anticipating this move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. It counters their most recent move (rock), and if they're continuing with rock based on their previous patterns of playing moves in streaks, this gives me the best chance of winning. While they could anticipate this and play scissors, I need to take a calculated risk to improve my record.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My strategy needs to improve - paper has been my least successful move (1 win, 5 losses), while scissors has been mixed (1 win, 3 losses, 4 ties).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. While it's been my least successful move overall, it directly counters their most recent move (rock).

It directly counters scissors (their most frequent move and their last played move), and if they continue their recent alternating pattern, they should play rock next, which would result in a tie rather than a loss.

Their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   \n4. Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 7 times (29.2%)\n   - Rock: 8 times (33.3%)\n   - Scissors: 9 times (37.5%)\n\n5. Interestingly, they've played paper twice in a row now.\n\n6. My overall record is: 4 wins, 11 losses, 10 ties\n   I'm still behind but improving my position.\n\n7. Given that they've played paper twice in a row:\n   - They might continue with paper if they're returning to their pattern of playing moves in streaks\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play scissors again after my win and switch to rock\n   - They could be trying to establish a new pattern\n\n8. My winning moves have been:\n   - Scissors against paper (Rounds 5 and 24)\n   - Rock against scissors (Round 17)\n   - Paper against rock (Round 13)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again this round. If they continue with paper for a third time (which would align with their earlier pattern of playing moves in streaks of three), I'll win again. While they might anticipate this and play rock, the potential reward of another win against a possible paper play outweighs the risk, especially given their demonstrated preference for repeating moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We tied - my opponent switched from paper to scissors.\n\n3.

Updated frequency of their moves:\n   - Paper: 7 times (28%)\n   - Rock: 8 times (32%)\n   - Scissors: 10 times (40%)\n   Scissors remains their most frequent move.\n\n5. My overall record is: 4 wins, 11 losses, 11 ties\n   I'm still significantly behind.\n\n6. The tie rate remains high at 44% (11 out of 25 rounds).\n\n7. After scissors, players often play rock next (a common psychological pattern):\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper to win\n   - If they repeat scissors, paper would lose\n\n8. Given their history of repeating moves and their strong preference for scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. It directly counters scissors (their most frequent move and their last played move), and if they repeat scissors, I have a good chance of winning. While it's vulnerable to paper, scissors has been their preferred move overall, making rock a strategically sound choice based on their demonstrated tendencies.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After rock, the natural progression would be paper:\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they repeat rock, scissors would lose\n\n8.

If they follow their previous rotation pattern after playing a move three times:\n   - After 3 papers, they played scissors\n   - After 3 scissors, they played paper\n   - After 3 rocks (the first time), they played scissors\n   - So after these 3 rocks, scissors or paper would be likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. Since they've completed a streak of three rocks, they're likely to switch to a new move. If they switch to scissors (which would follow one of their previous patterns), rock would win. While they could switch to paper instead, their historical pattern after three of the same move suggests a change is coming, and rock gives me a good chance against a potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
