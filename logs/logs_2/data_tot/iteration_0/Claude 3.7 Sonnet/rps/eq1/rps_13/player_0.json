    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of winning, 1/3 probability of losing, and 1/3 probability of tying. However, we should consider what most people tend to choose on their first move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Research suggests that in the first round, rock is the most common choice among players (approximately 35-40% of first moves), as it symbolizes strength and stability. Paper is typically the least chosen first move. Since we're playing against a fresh player, exploiting this tendency by playing paper might give us a slight edge.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While the game is theoretically balanced, studies of human behavior in rock-paper-scissors reveal patterns. A study in China with 360 students showed rock was chosen 36% of the time, scissors 32%, and paper 32% in first rounds. This supports the psychological analysis that paper might be our optimal first move.\n\nDecision Maker: Thank you all for the insights. Given that this is our first move against a fresh player with no established pattern, and considering the psychological tendency for people to choose rock as their first move, I'll choose paper as our strategic first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We won the first round by playing paper against their rock. Now we need to consider how our opponent might adjust their strategy. In repeated games, players often shift their moves based on previous outcomes. Since they lost with rock, they might switch to paper (to beat our expected rock) or scissors (to beat our previous paper).\n\nPsychological Strategist: People who lose a round often shift their strategy. Our opponent just lost with rock against our paper, so they're unlikely to play rock again. They're most likely to choose scissors next, anticipating that we'll play paper again. This is a common psychological pattern called \"one-level reasoning\" - they expect us to repeat our winning move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Data on sequential play shows that after losing, players typically shift to the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. In this case, they're likely to choose scissors to counter our previous paper. To counter this anticipated scissors, we should play rock.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis is compelling. Our opponent lost with rock against our paper, and the most likely response is for them to switch to scissors, expecting us to play paper again. To counter this anticipated scissors move, I'll choose rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

If this pattern continues, they might expect us to play scissors next (to beat their previous scissors), so they might play rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Our opponent has lost twice in a row now, which may trigger a change in their strategy. They appear to be using a simple adaptation strategy - trying to counter what they think we'll play next. Since we played rock last time, they might anticipate we'll play paper this time (following our own winning pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?). If they think we'll play paper, they'll likely choose scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at our sequence and the opponent's responses:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\nTheir pattern suggests they're always one step behind, playing what would counter our previous move. If this pattern holds, they'll play paper this round (to beat our previous rock). To counter their expected paper, we should play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: This is getting interesting.

Our sequence has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, and our opponent's has been rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. The opponent seems to be consistently playing what would beat our previous move, which is a predictable pattern we can exploit.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has lost three times in a row, which will likely trigger a more significant change in strategy. They might:\n1. Continue their pattern (playing rock to beat our scissors)\n2. Break the pattern completely with a random choice\n3. Try to predict our next move based on our pattern (we've gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, so they might expect us to cycle back to paper)\n4. Stick with their last move out of frustration\n\nGiven that we've established a clear winning streak, the opponent is most likely to break their pattern and try something new.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze the patterns more carefully:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 3: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n\nThe opponent has consistently played what would beat our previous move. If this pattern continues, they would play rock (to beat our scissors).

If they notice we've played the complete cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they might anticipate we'll start over with paper and play scissors to counter that.\n\nDecision Maker: This is a critical decision point. The opponent has shown a consistent pattern of playing what would beat our previous move. If they continue this pattern, they'll play rock. However, after three consecutive losses, they're likely to change strategies.\n\nConsidering all factors, I believe the opponent is most likely to either continue their established pattern (playing rock) or try to get ahead of our cycle (expecting us to play paper and countering with scissors). Between these two possibilities, I think continuing their established pattern is more likely since it's simpler.

The opponent is still following the same pattern of playing what would beat our previous move, despite consistently losing.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Four consecutive losses would typically trigger a strong pattern break in human players. However, our opponent appears to be following a rigid strategy regardless of outcomes. This suggests either:\n1. They're using a programmed algorithm rather than adaptive human thinking\n2. They're extremely stubborn in their approach\n3. They're playing a meta-game, hoping we'll eventually overthink and change our winning strategy\n\nGiven their consistency despite losing, I believe they'll continue their pattern.

Their strategy is entirely predictable and mechanical.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our match history shows perfect consistency across all twenty-eight rounds:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 2: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 3: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 4: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 5: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 6: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 7: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 8: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 9: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 10: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 11: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 12: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 13: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 14: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 15: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 16: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 17: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 18: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 19: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 20: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 21: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 22: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 23: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 24: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 25: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n- Round 26: We played rock, they played scissors (we won)\n- Round 27: We played scissors, they played paper (we won)\n- Round 28: We played paper, they played rock (we won)\n\nThe opponent has followed the same pattern with 100% consistency - always playing what would beat our previous move. If this pattern continues, they will play scissors this round (to beat our paper). To counter their expected scissors, we should play rock.\n\nDecision Maker: The evidence is absolutely conclusive that our opponent is using a fixed algorithm based solely on our previous move. Given their perfect consistency across twenty-eight rounds, the optimal strategy is to continue exploiting their predictable behavior.\n\nBased on our analysis, I'll choose rock to counter their expected scissors move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"
