Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's pattern is now fully established: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   Their last 6 moves confirm a clear alternating pattern between paper and rock.\n\n3. Based on this very consistent pattern, they will almost certainly choose paper next.\n\n4. To counter paper, my best move would be scissors (giving me +1 point).\n\n5. At this point, the pattern is so clear that it would be surprising if they deviated from it.\n\n6. However, they might finally realize I've figured out their pattern and try to break it:\n   - If they choose scissors (breaking pattern), I would lose -1 point\n   - If they choose rock again (breaking pattern), I would tie (0 points)\n\n7. But given their remarkable consistency so far, and the fact that they haven't adapted despite my winning streak, paper seems highly likely to be their next move.\n\n8. The expected value of choosing scissors remains the highest given the strong, consistent pattern observed.\n\n9. Additionally, I've won the last 4 rounds by correctly predicting their moves, which suggests they're not adapting their strategy.\n\n10. Scissors is my optimal play for this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their last two moves were scissors \u2192 rock, which could be the start of a new pattern.\n\n4. If they're establishing a new pattern beginning with scissors \u2192 rock, they might play paper next.\n\n5.

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock twice in a row, which is interesting.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent three moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   This could indicate they're getting more defensive with rock after trying scissors.\n\n4. They've now played rock in 4 of the last 5 rounds, showing a strong recent preference for rock.\n\n5. If they're establishing a new pattern of playing rock repeatedly, they might play rock again.\n\n6. However, they might also realize that playing rock repeatedly is becoming predictable and switch to paper or scissors.\n\n7.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 11: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie)\n\n2. My opponent broke their recent alternating pattern of scissors \u2192 paper by playing rock.\n\n3. Looking at their overall game, they've shown a tendency to play rock after experiencing losses:\n   - After losing in round 9, they played rock in round 10\n   - After losing in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After losing in round 16, they played paper in round 17\n   - After losing in round 17, they played rock in round 18\n\n4. They've now played rock, which is different from their recent pattern. This could indicate they're:\n   - Trying to be unpredictable\n   - Responding to my recent success by changing strategy\n   - Starting a new pattern\n\n5. Looking at what they've done after playing rock in the past:\n   - After round 6 (rock): they played paper\n   - After round 8 (rock): they played paper\n   - After round 10 (rock): they played scissors\n   - After round 12 (rock): they played rock\n   - After round 13 (rock): they played scissors\n   \n   This shows a slight tendency to play paper or scissors after rock, but not consistently.\n\n6. If they play:\n   - Rock again: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n7. Given their inconsistent follow-up to rock moves and the fact that we just tied with rock, they might expect me to play paper to try to beat their expected rock.\n\n8. If they anticipate I'll play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\n9. To counter their potential scissors play, rock would be my optimal choice (+1).\n\n10. However, they've played rock multiple times in succession before (rounds 12-13), so paper is also a reasonable choice with higher potential reward.\n\n11. Given the uncertainty and their past behavior after rock moves, scissors seems like a balanced choice that:\n    - Wins against paper (+1) which they've played after rock before\n    - Ties with scissors (0) which they've also played after rock\n    - Loses to rock (-1) with minimal penalty if they repeat rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   After breaking their alternating pattern with rock in round 18, they returned to paper in round 19.\n\n3. Looking at their overall choices, they've played:\n   - Paper: 9 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   Paper continues to be their most frequent choice.\n\n4. They've now lost several rounds in a row, which might influence their strategy:\n   - They lost in round 16 (scissors)\n   - They lost in round 17 (paper)\n   - They tied in round 18 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 19 (paper)\n\n5. After losing with paper in round 19, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to try to beat my expected scissors\n   - Switch to scissors to try something different\n   - Stick with paper hoping I'll switch strategies\n\n6. Looking at what they've done after playing paper and losing:\n   - After losing with paper in round 5: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 7: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 9: they played rock\n   - After losing with paper in round 17: they played rock\n\n7. This shows a very strong tendency to play rock after losing with paper.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - Paper again: scissors would win (+1)\n   - Scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Based on their established pattern after losing with paper, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. To counter rock, paper would be my optimal play (giving me +3 points).\n\n11. Given their highly consistent pattern of playing rock after losing with paper, paper seems like the most strategic choice with the highest expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They're showing a clear alternating pattern between paper and rock in recent rounds.\n\n3. They've now lost several rounds in a row:\n   - They lost in round 17 (paper)\n   - They tied in round 18 (rock)\n   - They lost in round 19 (paper)\n   - They lost in round 20 (rock)\n\n4. Looking at what they've done after playing rock and losing:\n   - After losing with rock in round 10: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 13: they played scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 20: ? (current decision)\n\n5. This shows a strong tendency to play scissors after losing with rock.\n\n6. Additionally, their recent alternating pattern between paper and rock suggests they might play paper next.\n\n7. Considering both their pattern after losing with rock (scissors) and their recent alternating pattern (paper), there's some uncertainty about their next move.\n\n8. If they play:\n   - Scissors (after losing with rock): rock would win (+1)\n   - Paper (continuing alternating pattern): scissors would win (+1)\n   - Rock again (breaking both patterns): paper would win (+3)\n\n9. Given their strong tendency to play scissors after losing with rock in previous instances, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. To counter scissors, rock would be my optimal play (giving me +1 point).\n\n11. Rock also provides a balanced risk profile - if they play paper instead, I lose 3 points, but their pattern after losing with rock suggests this is less likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
