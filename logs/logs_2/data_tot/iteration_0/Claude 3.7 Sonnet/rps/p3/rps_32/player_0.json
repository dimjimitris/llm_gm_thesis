Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper beats rock with highest reward (3 points vs -3), while rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper both give 1 point vs -1.\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no pattern to analyze.\n3. In the absence of information, I need to consider common first-move tendencies in rock-paper-scissors.\n4. Research suggests rock is often the most common first move for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n5. If my opponent plays rock, paper would give me the highest possible payoff (3 points).\n6. The downside risk of playing paper is losing 1 point to scissors, which is less than the 3 points I'd lose if I played rock against paper.\n7. Paper offers a good risk-reward balance for a first move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played scissors in 8 out of 11 rounds, showing an extraordinary commitment to this move.\n\n4. They've played scissors five times in a row now, despite losses and ties.\n\n5. This level of persistence with scissors defies conventional game theory and suggests:\n   a) They have an extremely strong bias toward scissors\n   b) They're executing a peculiar strategy hoping I'll eventually switch away from countering scissors\n   c) They're not actively adapting their strategy at all\n\n6. Given five consecutive scissors plays, the probability that they'll play scissors again remains surprisingly high based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\n7. However, even with this pattern, there must be some threshold where they would consider switching.\n\n8. If they do finally switch, paper would be their logical choice to counter my frequent rock plays.\n\n9. Rock has been my most successful move in this match, winning against their scissors multiple times.\n\n10.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie 0)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. They've now switched from scissors to paper, which has proven effective against my rock play.\n\n4. Looking at recent rounds, they seem to be getting better at predicting my moves and countering them.\n\n5. They've now used paper successfully against my rock twice in the last 6 rounds.\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Play rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n\n7. Given their success with paper in this situation before, and their pattern of occasionally repeating successful moves, option (a) seems plausible.\n\n8. However, they've also shown they can make strategic switches to stay ahead of my strategy.\n\n9. If they do play paper again, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n10. Given their recent success with paper against my rock, and the psychological tendency to repeat successful strategies, scissors offers the best expected value.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now used all three moves in the last three rounds: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n4. This suggests they might be deliberately cycling through moves to be less predictable.\n\n5. They've won the last two rounds by successfully countering my moves.\n\n6. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n   b) Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   c) Play scissors, expecting me to play paper to counter their rock\n\n7. If they're truly cycling through moves in sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), scissors would be next.\n\n8. However, they've also shown they can adapt strategically to win consecutive rounds.\n\n9. If they do play rock again, paper would be my best counter.\n\n10. Given their recent success with adapting to my moves and the possibility they're cycling through options, paper offers the best expected value against their potential rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
