    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their most recent sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) continues the rotation pattern I've observed throughout the game.\n\nIf they're following this pattern, their next move would be scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, given their remarkable success rate against me, I need to consider that they might be employing a more sophisticated strategy than a simple rotation. They might be anticipating my recognition of their pattern and adjusting accordingly.\n\nAt this point, I'll play rock, which would:\n- Beat scissors if they follow their apparent pattern\n- Tie with rock if they play that\n- Lose to paper if they counter my expected move\n\n[move] Rock\n"
