Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I notice a striking pattern - my opponent has now played rock five times, and I've won with paper against their rock four times.\n\n4. Despite repeatedly losing with rock, they continue to play it frequently.\n\n5. After losing with rock in the last round, they might finally change strategy more significantly.\n\n6. Given their history of losses with rock, they're likely to play either paper (to beat my potential rock) or scissors (to beat my potential paper).\n\n7. Considering I've just won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock (anticipating their scissors) and play paper to counter.\n\n9. Based on their overall pattern and tendency to return to rock despite losses, scissors seems most likely from them this round as they try to break their losing streak.\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n11. If they play paper, rock would lose badly (-3 points).\n\n12. If they play rock again (which seems less likely but has been a persistent pattern), rock would tie.\n\n13. Given their likely frustration with repeated losses and the psychological tendency to counter the move that just beat you, I think scissors is their most probable move.\n\n14. Therefore, I'll play rock this round to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've won the last two rounds, first with paper against their rock, then with rock against their scissors.\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern, there's a tendency to alternate between rock and scissors, with occasional paper plays.\n\n5. After losing with scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock (returning to their most common choice)\n   - Play paper (trying to beat my potential rock, since I just won with rock)\n   - Play scissors again (being unpredictable)\n\n6. Psychologically, after losing to rock with scissors, many players would switch to paper to beat the rock that just defeated them.\n\n7. Given that I've consistently won against their rock with paper, they might be hesitant to play rock again.\n\n8. Their most logical move would be paper, expecting me to play rock again after just winning with it.\n\n9. If they play paper, my best counter is scissors.\n\n10.

Psychologically, after breaking a long losing streak, players often:\n   - Stick with the move that just worked\n   - Feel more confident and start thinking more strategically\n   - Try to establish a new winning pattern\n\n6. Given that they just won with paper against my rock, they're likely to:\n   - Play paper again (expecting me to play rock again)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper)\n\n7. Of these options, scissors seems more likely because:\n   - It would counter my potential paper (which would be a logical move for me after losing to paper)\n   - It represents a forward-thinking strategy rather than simply repeating the last move\n   - It continues their pattern of rotation (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n9. If they play paper again, rock would lose again (-3 points).\n\n10. If they play rock, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n11. Considering the psychological boost from their recent win and their likely strategic thinking after breaking their losing streak, scissors seems their most probable move.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play rock this round to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now won two consecutive rounds by playing paper against my rock.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n4. After winning twice with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper for a third time, believing it will work again\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock, thinking I might play scissors to counter their paper\n\n5. Psychologically, after two consecutive wins with the same move, players often:\n   - Continue with the winning move (paper)\n   - Anticipate that their opponent will adjust and counter accordingly\n\n6. Given that they've won twice with paper against my rock, they're likely to:\n   - Play paper again (expecting me to play rock again or thinking I won't expect them to use the same move three times)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper)\n\n7. Of these options, paper seems more likely because:\n   - It has worked twice in a row\n   - They might believe I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, in which case they would switch to rock\n   - However, since paper has the highest payoff when it wins, sticking with it is tempting\n\n8. If they play paper again, my best counter is scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, scissors would tie (0 points).\n\n10. If they play rock, scissors would lose (-1 point).\n\n11. Considering their recent success with paper and the psychological tendency to stick with what's working, paper seems their most probable move for a third time.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play scissors this round to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won six consecutive rounds, using the sequence scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my rock)\n   - Play rock (to tie if I play rock again)\n   - Avoid scissors (since it just lost)\n\n5. Looking at the overall game history, they seem to be somewhat predictable in their responses to losses.\n\n6. Psychologically, after losing with scissors, they're likely to:\n   - Play paper (to counter the rock that just beat them)\n   - Try to break the pattern that's leading to their continued losses\n\n7. Given that I've just won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again, in which case they would play paper.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to scissors (continuing my rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper sequence), in which case they would play rock.\n\n9. Of these options, paper seems more likely because:\n   - It would counter my rock that just beat them\n   - It's a logical response after losing to rock\n   - They've shown a tendency to counter the move that just beat them\n   - Paper gives them the highest potential payoff (+3 points)\n\n10. If they play paper, my best counter is scissors.\n\n11. If they play rock, scissors would lose (-1 point).\n\n12. If they play scissors again, scissors would tie (0 points).\n\n13. Considering their likely strategy adjustment after losing to rock and the psychological tendency to counter the move that just beat them, paper seems their most probable choice.\n\n14. Therefore, I'll play scissors this round to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n11. If they play paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\n12. If they play rock again, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n13. Considering their extremely consistent strategy of countering the move that just beat them, scissors seems their most probable choice.\n\n14. Therefore, I'll play rock this round to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
