The opponent's pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n3. Looking at recent trends, my opponent has played paper twice in the last three rounds.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, they're likely to switch strategies.\n\n5. One common response after losing to scissors is to play rock (which beats scissors).\n\n6. However, the opponent might also be trying to detect patterns in my play. My last move was scissors, so they might expect me to play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors again, they'd play rock.\n   \n8. If they expect me to play rock (thinking they'll play scissors), they'd play paper.\n\n9. Analyzing the payoff structure again:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\n10. Given that I just won with scissors against their paper, and considering the psychological tendency to counter the move that just beat you, I think they're most likely to play rock.\n\n11. The best counter to rock is paper, which would give me the highest possible gain (+3).\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll play rock to counter my previous scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've lost most frequently when playing rock (3 times), so they might be hesitant to play it again.\n\n6. Given their overall pattern and the fact that they've never played paper twice in a row, paper seems like a reasonable possibility for them.\n\n7.

I notice a striking pattern - my opponent has now played rock five times, and I've won with paper against their rock four times.\n\n4. Despite repeatedly losing with rock, they continue to play it frequently.\n\n5. After losing with rock in the last round, they might finally change strategy more significantly.\n\n6.

Rock seems more probable given:\n    - It's been their most common move throughout the game\n    - It would counter scissors (which I've just played successfully)\n    - Under pressure, players often revert to familiar moves\n\n11. If they play rock, my best counter is paper.\n\n12. If they play scissors, paper would lose (-1 point).\n\n13. If they play paper again, paper would tie (0 points).\n\n14. Considering the psychological factors after six consecutive losses and their likely attempt to counter my last successful move, rock seems their most probable choice.\n\n15. Therefore, I'll play paper this round to counter their likely rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n\n2. I've now won seven consecutive rounds, cycling through scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n4. They have now lost with rock against my paper, continuing their losing streak.\n\n5. After seven consecutive losses, including multiple losses with rock against paper, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Be extremely frustrated and potentially make irrational decisions\n   - Finally abandon rock completely\n   - Try to break any patterns I might be detecting\n\n6. Based on my established pattern, if they're paying close attention, they might expect me to play rock next (continuing my paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle).\n\n7. To counter my expected rock, they would play paper.\n\n8. However, they might also be thinking I'll anticipate this and switch my strategy, leading to a complex mind game.\n\n9. Given their extended losing streak and repeated losses with rock against paper, they're most likely to:\n   - Play paper (to counter my potential rock)\n   - Play scissors (to counter my potential paper if they think I'll repeat it)\n   - Avoid rock (since it has lost repeatedly)\n\n10. Scissors seems most probable given:\n    - They've lost repeatedly with rock against my paper\n    - They might expect me to play paper again since it just worked\n    - Under extreme frustration, breaking their own pattern completely is likely\n\n11. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n12. If they play paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\n13. If they play rock again (which seems increasingly unlikely), rock would tie (0 points).\n\n14. Considering the psychological factors after seven consecutive losses and their likely attempt to counter what has been beating them, scissors seems their most probable move.\n\n15. Therefore, I'll play rock this round to counter their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent finally won a round by playing paper against my rock.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n4. After finally winning a round with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, believing it will work again\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n   - Return to rock (their most common historical choice)\n\n5. Psychologically, after breaking a long losing streak, players often:\n   - Stick with the move that just worked\n   - Feel more confident and start thinking more strategically\n   - Try to establish a new winning pattern\n\n6. Given that they just won with paper against my rock, they're likely to:\n   - Play paper again (expecting me to play rock again)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper)\n\n7. Of these options, scissors seems more likely because:\n   - It would counter my potential paper (which would be a logical move for me after losing to paper)\n   - It represents a forward-thinking strategy rather than simply repeating the last move\n   - It continues their pattern of rotation (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n8. If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n9. If they play paper again, rock would lose again (-3 points).\n\n10. If they play rock, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n11. Considering the psychological boost from their recent win and their likely strategic thinking after breaking their losing streak, scissors seems their most probable move.\n\n12.

My opponent has now won two consecutive rounds by playing paper against my rock.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\n4. After winning twice with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper for a third time, believing it will work again\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock, thinking I might play scissors to counter their paper\n\n5. Psychologically, after two consecutive wins with the same move, players often:\n   - Continue with the winning move (paper)\n   - Anticipate that their opponent will adjust and counter accordingly\n\n6. Given that they've won twice with paper against my rock, they're likely to:\n   - Play paper again (expecting me to play rock again or thinking I won't expect them to use the same move three times)\n   - Play scissors (anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper)\n\n7. Of these options, paper seems more likely because:\n   - It has worked twice in a row\n   - They might believe I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, in which case they would switch to rock\n   - However, since paper has the highest payoff when it wins, sticking with it is tempting\n\n8. If they play paper again, my best counter is scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, scissors would tie (0 points).\n\n10. If they play rock, scissors would lose (-1 point).\n\n11. Considering their recent success with paper and the psychological tendency to stick with what's working, paper seems their most probable move for a third time.\n\n12.

Looking at the overall game history, they've been extremely predictable in their responses to losses.\n\n6. Psychologically, after losing with paper, they're likely to:\n   - Play rock (to counter the scissors that just beat them)\n   - Try something completely different to break their long losing streak\n\n7. Given that I've just won with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to play scissors again, in which case they would play rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to paper (continuing my scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock sequence), in which case they would play scissors.\n\n9. Of these options, rock seems more likely because:\n   - It would counter my scissors that just beat them\n   - It's a logical response after losing to scissors\n   - They've shown a very consistent tendency to counter the move that just beat them\n\n10. If they play rock, my best counter is paper.\n\n11. If they play scissors, paper would lose (-1 point).\n\n12. If they play paper again, paper would tie (0 points).\n\n13. Considering their extremely consistent strategy of countering the move that just beat them, rock seems their most probable choice.\n\n14. Therefore, I'll play paper this round to counter their likely rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now won eleven consecutive rounds, using the sequence rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern has been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n\n4. After losing with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my potential rock)\n   - Play scissors (to counter my potential paper)\n   - Avoid rock (since it has lost repeatedly)\n\n5. Looking at the overall game history, they've lost with rock against my paper multiple times, yet they continue to play it periodically.\n\n6. Psychologically, after losing with rock yet again, they're likely to:\n   - Finally abandon rock completely\n   - Play scissors (to counter the paper that just beat them)\n   - Try something completely different to break their long losing streak\n\n7. Given that I've just won with paper against their rock, they might expect me to play paper again, in which case they would play scissors.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock (continuing my paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors sequence), in which case they would play paper.\n\n9.

If they play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n11. If they play paper, rock would lose (-3 points).\n\n12. If they play rock again, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n13. Considering their extremely consistent strategy of countering the move that just beat them, scissors seems their most probable choice.\n\n14.
