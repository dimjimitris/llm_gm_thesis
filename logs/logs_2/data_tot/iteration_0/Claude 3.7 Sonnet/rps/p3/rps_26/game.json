At this point, I have to consider that:\n\n1) They have an overwhelming strategic preference for paper\n2) They might finally adapt after losing to scissors again\n3) They might be employing reverse psychology, expecting me to switch from scissors\n\nGiven their extraordinary paper preference despite repeated losses, I think they're still most likely to play paper again. However, there's an increased chance they'll finally switch to rock to counter my scissors. I'll play paper which would beat their potential rock and tie against their potential paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
