    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent might anticipate that I'll move to paper (to beat their previous rock), and therefore they might play scissors.\n\n5.

The safest option against a strategic player after a rock-rock tie would be to play rock again, as:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I win (+1)\n   - If they play rock again, it's another tie (0)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to repeat rock), I lose (-3)\n\n8.

Looking at what happened after my previous scissors wins:\n   - After round 5 win, I played paper in round 6, and my opponent countered with scissors and won.\n   - After round 8 win, I played paper in round 9, and my opponent countered with scissors and won.\n\n4. There's a clear pattern: after I win with scissors, I've played paper and then lost to scissors.\n\n5. My opponent seems to anticipate that I'll switch to paper after winning with scissors.\n\n6. Given this pattern, my opponent is likely expecting me to play paper again and will counter with scissors.\n\n7. To break this pattern and counter their expected scissors, I should play rock.\n\n8. Additionally, my opponent has played scissors after I win in previous rounds, so rock would be an effective counter to this tendency.\n\n9. Playing rock gives me a chance to win if they play scissors as expected, or tie if they anticipate my reasoning and play rock as well.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has shown they can break patterns and anticipate my moves well. They correctly anticipated I would play scissors in round 13.\n\n4. After I lose a round, my next moves have varied:\n   - After losing round 2, I played paper in round 3 and lost again\n   - After losing round 3, I played rock in round 4 and tied\n   - After losing round 6, I played rock in round 7 and tied\n   - After losing round 9, I played rock in round 10 and tied\n\n5. It appears that playing rock after a loss has resulted in ties for me.\n\n6. My opponent just played rock and won. Based on their previous patterns:\n   - After winning with rock in round 2 (against my paper), they played scissors in round 3\n   - After tying with rock in rounds 4, 7, and 10, they consistently played paper in the next round\n\n7. Since they just won with rock, they might follow their pattern and play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n8.

I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (+3)\n\n2. I've now won three consecutive rounds (rounds 17, 18, and 19).\n\n3. Looking at my behavior after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 1, I played rock in round 2 and lost\n   - I should avoid repeating that pattern\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's behavior after losing to paper:\n   - After losing to paper in round 1, they played paper in round 2\n   - After losing to paper in round 19 (just now), they might follow the same pattern and play paper\n\n5. When my opponent has lost three or more consecutive rounds:\n   - This is the first time in our game that they've lost three consecutive rounds\n   - They might be more desperate to break their losing streak and play more aggressively\n\n6. My opponent might expect me to play paper again after winning with it.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper, they're likely to counter with scissors.\n\n8. If they play scissors to counter my expected paper, my best response would be rock.\n\n9. Additionally, rock has worked well for me recently (won in round 18).\n\n10. Given these considerations, and the high probability that my opponent will play scissors to counter my expected paper play, I'll choose rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"
