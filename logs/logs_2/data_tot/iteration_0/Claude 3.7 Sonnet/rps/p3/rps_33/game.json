After a tie, players often change their move rather than repeating the same one.\n\n4. My opponent might anticipate that I'll move to paper (to beat their previous rock), and therefore they might play scissors.\n\n5. Alternatively, they might stick with rock, thinking I'll play scissors expecting them to play paper.\n\n6. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent appears to be strategic and adaptable. They've managed to counter or tie with me in the last three rounds.\n\n7. The safest option against a strategic player after a rock-rock tie would be to play rock again, as:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), I win (+1)\n   - If they play rock again, it's another tie (0)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to repeat rock), I lose (-3)\n\n8.

In round 12, I successfully broke my pattern by playing rock after winning with scissors, and my opponent indeed played scissors as I predicted.\n\n4. After losing to my rock, my opponent might expect me to stick with the winning move (rock).\n\n5. If they expect me to play rock again, they're likely to counter with paper.\n\n6. Looking at previous rounds where I won consecutively:\n   - After rounds 1 (win), I lost in round 2 when I played rock and they countered with paper.\n   - After rounds 5 (win), I lost in round 6 when I played paper and they countered with scissors.\n   - After rounds 8 (win), I lost in round 9 when I played paper and they countered with scissors.\n\n7. My opponent has shown they adapt well after losing, successfully countering my next move.\n\n8. Given their likely expectation that I'll play rock again, and their pattern of effective adaptation after losses, they're most likely to play paper.\n\n9. To counter their expected paper play, I should choose scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n"

In the previous round, I played scissors expecting my opponent to play paper, but they played rock instead and I lost.\n\n3. My opponent has shown they can break patterns and anticipate my moves well. They correctly anticipated I would play scissors in round 13.\n\n4. After I lose a round, my next moves have varied:\n   - After losing round 2, I played paper in round 3 and lost again\n   - After losing round 3, I played rock in round 4 and tied\n   - After losing round 6, I played rock in round 7 and tied\n   - After losing round 9, I played rock in round 10 and tied\n\n5. It appears that playing rock after a loss has resulted in ties for me.\n\n6. My opponent just played rock and won. Based on their previous patterns:\n   - After winning with rock in round 2 (against my paper), they played scissors in round 3\n   - After tying with rock in rounds 4, 7, and 10, they consistently played paper in the next round\n\n7. Since they just won with rock, they might follow their pattern and play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper and they play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n9.

When my opponent has played paper, I've responded with:\n   - Rock in round 2 and lost\n   - Scissors in rounds 5, 8, and 11 and won each time\n\n6. Scissors has been consistently effective against my opponent's paper plays.\n\n7. After consecutive losses, I need to break out of this losing pattern.\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to play scissors (to counter their paper), they might play rock.\n\n9.

Looking at my opponent's behavior after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 2, they played scissors in round 3\n   - After winning with paper in round 14, they played scissors in round 15\n   - After winning with paper in round 20 (just now), they might follow this pattern and play scissors\n\n5. When my opponent has won with paper, they've consistently played scissors in the next round.\n\n6. If I expect them to play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n7. Rock has worked well against their scissors plays (rounds 12, 15, 18).\n\n8. Given the consistent pattern of my opponent playing scissors after winning with paper, rock seems to be the strongest move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

Additionally, paper has worked well after winning with rock (rounds 19, 22, and 25).\n\n8. Given the pattern of my opponent playing rock after losing to rock, and my success with paper in this situation, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (highest reward)\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point\n4. The paper-rock outcome has the highest potential reward (+3), making paper an attractive first move.\n5.

        "I'll think step-by-step about how to approach this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n1. I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history between us.\n2. The payoff structure is important: paper beating rock gives 3 points (highest reward), while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper only give 1 point each.\n3. Since this is the first round with no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what most players might do.\n4. Many players often choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's psychologically seen as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses rock, I get 3 points (maximum possible).\n6. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses scissors, I lose 1 point.\n7. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses paper, it's a tie with 0 points.\n8. Given the higher reward for paper beating rock (3 points vs. 1 point for other winning combinations), and the common tendency for players to choose rock first, paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my move.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Let me consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for me if I choose rock and they choose scissors\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for me if I choose paper and they choose rock\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for me if I choose scissors and they choose paper\n4. Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n5. Since I have no prior information, I could choose randomly or consider what a typical first-time player might choose.\n6. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n7.

Since paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, it seems like a good option.\n4. However, I need to consider what the other player might be thinking.\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n6. If I assume they chose rock, then paper would be my best response.\n7. The risk is if they chose scissors, but the potential reward of +3 points outweighs the risk of -1 points if I'm wrong.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Without prior information, each move has equal expected value in theory.\n5. However, research suggests that in first-time rock-paper-scissors games, rock is the most common opening move for many players.\n6. If I assume the opponent might play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n7. Paper also has the highest potential payoff (3 points) if I win.\n8.

Now I need to anticipate my opponent's likely next move.\n3. After losing to paper, many players will shift to scissors (which would beat my previous move).\n4. If my opponent plays scissors, my best response would be rock.\n5. However, my opponent might also anticipate that I'll expect them to switch to scissors, and they might stay with rock or switch to paper.\n6. Given that the opponent lost significantly (-3 points) to paper, there's a strong psychological incentive for them to counter with scissors.\n7. The safest counter to scissors is rock, which would give me +1 if I'm right.\n8. The risk of playing rock is lower than other options - if they play rock again, it's a tie (0 points), and if they play paper, I lose 3 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n",

Alternatively, they might switch to paper thinking I'll choose rock.\n6. Given that they just lost significantly (-3 points), they're likely to change their strategy.\n7. The most logical counter to my previous paper would be scissors.\n8. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their likely scissors.\n9. If they play paper instead, I lose 3 points, but if they play scissors and I choose rock, I gain 1 point.\n10. If they repeat rock (less likely), I would lose 1 point with rock.\n11.

If they switch to scissors, I should play rock to win.\n7. Between these two possibilities, scissors seems more likely because many players follow a \"rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\" rotation pattern.\n8.

This suggests they might be cycling through moves and scissors would come next.\n\n5. If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n6. However, if they're being more strategic and trying to counter what they think I'll play, they might expect me to play rock (to beat their anticipated scissors), and thus they might play paper.\n\n7. Given that paper vs rock has the highest stakes (+3/-3), they might be tempted to play paper to potentially gain more points.\n\n8. The safest option that also has potential for gain would be rock:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing their cycle or expecting me to play paper), I win (+1)\n   - If they play paper (trying to counter my anticipated rock), I lose (-3)\n   - If they play rock (trying to counter my previous scissors), it's a tie (0)\n\n9. Since I've already accumulated 0 points overall (3-3-1+0+1=0), I should consider balancing risk and reward.\n\n10.

My opponent seems to be good at anticipating my moves. When I thought they'd play rock in round 6, they actually played scissors.\n\n5.

There's a clear pattern: after I win with scissors, I've consistently played paper in the next round, and my opponent has successfully countered with scissors both times.\n\n5. My opponent seems to be very good at recognizing and exploiting my patterns.\n\n6. Breaking my own pattern is essential. Given that I've played paper after my scissors wins twice before (and lost both times), I should avoid paper this time.\n\n7. My opponent likely expects me to either:\n   - Play paper again (following my established pattern after scissors wins)\n   - Or break the pattern by playing rock (to counter their expected scissors)\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they'll play scissors again.\n   If they expect me to play rock, they'll play paper.\n\n9. Since my opponent has been adaptive and pattern-recognizing, they're more likely to expect me to break my pattern this time.\n\n10. Therefore, they're more likely to play paper (expecting my rock). In this case, scissors would be my best counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n",

This pattern has now occurred three times (rounds 5, 8, and 11).\n\n3. Looking at what happened after my previous scissors wins:\n   - After round 5 win, I played paper in round 6, and my opponent countered with scissors and won\n   - After round 8 win, I played paper in round 9, and my opponent countered with scissors and won\n\n4. There's a clear pattern that after I win with scissors, I've played paper and my opponent has successfully countered with scissors both times.\n\n5. My opponent seems to recognize patterns and adapt effectively. They'll likely expect me to play paper again after my scissors win.\n\n6. If they expect me to play paper, they're likely to play scissors again.\n\n7. To break this pattern and counter their expected scissors play, I should play rock.\n\n8. This is especially important since I've fallen into this exact trap twice before (rounds 6 and 9).\n\n9. Playing rock would give me +1 point if they play scissors as expected, 0 points if they play rock, and -3 if they play paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

I'm now on a two-round winning streak, having won with scissors in round 11 and rock in round 12.\n\n3. Looking at patterns after I win:\n   - When I won with paper in round 1, my opponent played paper in round 2\n   - When I won with scissors in round 5, my opponent played scissors in round 6\n   - When I won with scissors in round 8, my opponent played scissors in round 9\n   - When I won with scissors in round 11, my opponent played scissors in round 12\n\n4. There's a pattern where my opponent tends to play the move that just beat them in the next round.\n\n5. Following this pattern, since I just beat them with rock, they might play rock in this round.\n\n6. Another pattern is that after I win consecutive rounds, my opponent adapts effectively:\n   - After my win in round 1, they won in round 2\n   - After my win in round 5, they won in round 6\n   - After my win in round 8, they won in round 9\n\n7. This suggests they're good at breaking winning streaks, and I should be particularly careful now that I've won twice in a row.\n\n8. If they play rock as predicted, my best counter would be paper.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate this reasoning and play scissors instead.\n\n10.

In round 12, I successfully broke my pattern by playing rock after winning with scissors, and my opponent indeed played scissors as I predicted.\n\n4. After losing to my rock, my opponent might expect me to stick with the winning move (rock).\n\n5. If they expect me to play rock again, they're likely to counter with paper.\n\n6. Looking at previous rounds where I won consecutively:\n   - After rounds 1 (win), I lost in round 2 when I played rock and they countered with paper.\n   - After rounds 5 (win), I lost in round 6 when I played paper and they countered with scissors.\n   - After rounds 8 (win), I lost in round 9 when I played paper and they countered with scissors.\n\n7. My opponent has shown they adapt well after losing, successfully countering my next move.\n\n8.

After losing to scissors in round 11, they played scissors in round 12. After losing to rock in round 12, they might play paper to counter rock.\n\n5. Looking at broader patterns, after I win:\n   - When I won with paper (round 1), they played paper next (round 2)\n   - When I won with scissors (rounds 5, 8, 11), they often anticipated my next move correctly\n\n6. My opponent seems to be good at predicting my moves after I win, so I should avoid being predictable.\n\n7. The conventional wisdom would be to stick with rock after winning with it, but my opponent likely expects me to either:\n   - Stick with rock (the winning move)\n   - Switch to paper (to counter their expected rock)\n\n8. If they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper. If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors.\n\n9.

My opponent tends to counter my winning moves effectively. After I win, they've played paper once and scissors three times.\n\n5. After I win with rock specifically (this is the first time), they might anticipate I'll stick with rock and counter with paper.\n\n6.

In the previous round, I expected my opponent to play paper after losing to my rock, but they played rock instead and beat my scissors.\n\n3. My opponent has now played rock in the last round. Looking at previous rounds where they played rock:\n   - After round 1 (rock), they played paper in round 2\n   - After round 4 (rock tie), they played paper in round 5\n   - After round 7 (rock tie), they played paper in round 8\n   - After round 10 (rock tie), they played paper in round 11\n\n4. There's a consistent pattern: after playing rock, my opponent tends to play paper in the next round.\n\n5. However, this is the first time they've won with rock, which might change their behavior.\n\n6. My opponent seems to adapt well to my moves, often anticipating my strategy.\n\n7. They might expect me to counter their rock with paper, and therefore play scissors.\n\n8. Alternatively, since rock worked well for them, they might stick with it.\n\n9. Given their historical tendency to play paper after rock, but considering they might adapt differently after winning, I need to balance these possibilities.\n\n10.

This suggests they often play rock after winning with scissors. However, they just won with rock, not scissors.\n\n7. After winning with paper in round 2, they played scissors next. This might suggest they like to cycle to the next move after winning.\n\n8. If they follow a cycling pattern after winning with rock, they might play paper next.\n\n9.

I've now lost two consecutive rounds (rounds 13 and 14).\n\n3. My opponent has beaten me with rock followed by paper. This suggests they might continue their winning sequence with scissors.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's behavior after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 2, they played scissors in round 3\n   - They've played paper in round 14 and won, so they might play scissors in round 15 following this pattern\n\n5. When my opponent has played paper, I've responded with:\n   - Rock in round 2 and lost\n   - Scissors in rounds 5, 8, and 11 and won each time\n\n6. Scissors has been consistently effective against my opponent's paper plays.\n\n7. After consecutive losses, I need to break out of this losing pattern.\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to play scissors (to counter their paper), they might play rock.\n\n9. However, given their pattern of playing scissors after winning with paper, and my success with scissors against their paper plays, I believe they're more likely to play scissors in this round.\n\n10.

Looking at my consecutive losses:\n   - After rounds 2-3 consecutive losses, I played rock in round 4 and tied\n   - After rounds 13-14 consecutive losses (current situation), I need to break this losing streak\n\n5. My opponent has now played paper \u2192 scissors multiple times in the game.\n\n6. If they follow their established pattern after winning with paper, they're likely to play scissors in this round.\n\n7. The best counter to scissors would be rock.\n\n8. Additionally, my opponent might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper, which would lead them to play rock.

I've now lost two rounds in a row, with a significant -3 point loss in the last round.\n\n3. My opponent has played paper after playing rock in the previous round multiple times (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 14).\n\n4. Looking at what my opponent does after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 2, they played scissors in round 3\n   - After winning with paper in round 14, I need to predict their next move\n\n5. Given their pattern, after winning with paper they tend to play scissors next.\n\n6. Additionally, my opponent might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper, so they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n7. I've lost significantly with rock against their paper, so they might expect me to avoid rock.\n\n8. If I expect them to play scissors (based on their pattern after winning with paper) or rock (to counter my expected scissors), my safest move would be rock:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - Rock ties with rock (0)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3), but I think this is less likely based on their patterns\n\n9. However, given that I just lost with rock against paper, playing rock again might be predictable.\n\n10.

I've now lost two consecutive rounds (rounds 13 and 14).\n\n3. My opponent has just won with paper against my rock, the highest possible point differential.\n\n4. Looking at previous instances when my opponent played paper:\n   - In round 2, they played paper and won, then played scissors in round 3\n   - In round 5, they played paper and lost, then played scissors in round 6\n   - In round 8, they played paper and lost, then played scissors in round 9\n   - In round 11, they played paper and lost, then played scissors in round 12\n\n5. There's a strong pattern: after playing paper (win or lose), my opponent has consistently played scissors in the next round.\n\n6. Based on this pattern, they're very likely to play scissors in this round.\n\n7. If I expect them to play scissors, my best counter is rock.\n\n8. However, my rock plays have not been successful recently, and my opponent might anticipate this reasoning.\n\n9. Given their adaptability, they might break their own pattern, expecting me to play rock to counter their usual scissors after paper.\n\n10.

This is similar to round 2, where they also beat my rock with paper.\n\n4. After winning with paper in round 2, my opponent played scissors in round 3.\n\n5. My opponent seems to follow certain patterns:\n   - After winning with paper, they've often played scissors in the next round\n   - After winning with rock, they've played paper in the next round (as seen in round 14)\n\n6. If they follow their pattern after winning with paper, they're likely to play scissors in this round.\n\n7.

I just lost with scissors against their rock.\n\n3. Looking at my behavior after losing with scissors:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 13, I played rock in round 14 and lost again\n\n4. My opponent has now played rock twice in the last three rounds (rounds 13 and 16).\n\n5. When my opponent has played rock:\n   - In round 1, I played paper and won\n   - In rounds 4, 7, and 10, we both played rock and tied\n   - In rounds 13 and 16, I played scissors and lost\n\n6. Paper has been my only successful counter to their rock plays.\n\n7. Looking at my opponent's pattern after winning with rock:\n   - After winning with rock in round 13, they played paper in round 14\n   - They might follow the same pattern and play paper after winning with rock in round 16\n\n8. If I expect them to play paper, scissors would be the appropriate counter.\n\n9. However, given that I've just lost with scissors to their rock, they might expect me to switch to paper and counter with scissors.\n\n10. My opponent has shown they can anticipate my moves, but they also follow certain patterns themselves.\n\n11. Given their tendency to play paper after winning with rock, and my previous success countering their paper with scissors, I'll play scissors again despite just losing with it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n",

I just lost by playing scissors against their rock.\n\n3. I notice that my opponent has played rock in rounds 13 and 16, both times beating my scissors. This suggests they may be identifying a pattern in when I play scissors.\n\n4. Looking at my behavior after losing with scissors:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 13, I played rock in round 14 and lost\n   - I should avoid repeating that pattern\n\n5. My opponent has just played rock and won. Based on their previous patterns:\n   - After winning with rock in round 13, they played paper in round 14\n   - They might follow this pattern and play paper again\n\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect paper and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Looking at the overall game, my opponent has demonstrated good adaptability and pattern recognition.\n\n8. When I've lost to rock, my subsequent moves have varied:\n   - After losing to rock in round 13, I played rock in round 14 and lost\n   - Paper would be the logical counter to their expected rock play\n\n9. Given that my opponent has beaten me with rock twice when I played scissors, they might expect me to avoid scissors and play either rock or paper.\n\n10. If they expect me to play paper (to counter their previous rock), they might play scissors.\n\n11. To counter their potential scissors play, I should choose rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n",

I lost (-3)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+1)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost (-1)\n\n2. My opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 15 and 16).\n\n3. Looking at previous instances when my opponent played rock:\n   - After playing rock in round 1, they played paper in round 2\n   - After playing rock in rounds 4, 7, and 10 (all ties), they played paper in the next round\n   - After playing rock in round 13, they played paper in round 14\n\n4. There's a strong pattern that after my opponent plays rock, they tend to play paper in the next round.\n\n5. If this pattern holds, they're likely to play paper in this round.\n\n6. When I've faced paper from my opponent, scissors has been my most successful counter (winning in rounds 5, 8, and 11).\n\n7. However, my opponent might anticipate this reasoning, especially since I just played scissors in the previous round.\n\n8. Given that I just lost with scissors against their rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors and play either rock or paper.\n\n9. If they expect me to play rock or paper and they play paper, my paper would tie and my rock would lose.\n\n10. Despite the risk of them anticipating my move, their strong pattern of playing paper after rock makes scissors my best option.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] scissors\n",

My opponent has played rock in the last round and won against my scissors.\n\n3. Looking at patterns after my opponent wins with rock:\n   - After winning with rock in round 13, they played paper in round 14\n   - They may follow this pattern and play paper again\n\n4. I've also noticed that when I've lost with scissors (rounds 13 and 16), my opponent has played rock.\n\n5. When my opponent plays rock twice in a row (rounds 4 & 5, 7 & 8, 10 & 11), they've never played rock a third time. Instead, they've consistently played paper after two rock plays.\n\n6. However, my opponent has shown adaptability and might anticipate that I'll expect paper and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Given that they've just won with rock against my scissors, they might stick with the winning move, expecting me to play paper (which would lose to scissors).\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper and they play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n9. Alternatively, if they play paper (following their pattern after winning with rock), my best move would be scissors.\n\n10. Considering their demonstrated ability to break patterns and anticipate my moves, and the fact that they've just successfully used rock, I think they're more likely to play scissors expecting my paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at my opponent's behavior after losing to rock:\n   - After losing to rock in round 1, they played paper in round 2\n   - After losing to rock in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After losing to rock in round 18 (just now), their response might vary\n\n5. When my opponent has lost twice in a row (as they have now), they've typically made adaptive changes to break their losing streak.\n\n6. If they follow their earliest pattern after losing to rock, they might play paper.\n\n7. However, given their more recent behavior and the fact that they've lost twice in a row, they might be more unpredictable.\n\n8. Paper would be the logical counter if they play rock, and it also has the highest potential reward (+3).\n\n9. Given that I've won with rock twice recently (rounds 15 and 18), my opponent might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n10.

Looking at my opponent's behavior after losing to rock:\n   - After losing to rock in round 1, they played paper in round 2\n   - After losing to rock in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After losing to rock in round 18 (just now), they might play either paper or rock\n\n5. When my opponent has lost multiple consecutive rounds, they might be more likely to change their strategy significantly.\n\n6. If they follow their pattern from round 1 to 2, they might play paper after losing to rock.\n\n7. If they follow their pattern from round 15 to 16, they might play rock after losing to rock.\n\n8. Given my success with rock in the last round and the opponent's potential adaptability, I need to consider both scenarios.\n\n9. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n   If they play rock, paper would be my best counter.\n\n10. Since paper has the highest potential reward (+3) against rock and would at least tie against paper, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] paper\n",

My opponent doesn't have a completely consistent pattern after losing to rock, but paper is a common response.\n\n6. If they play paper, my best counter would be scissors.\n\n7. However, playing scissors after winning with rock has led to losses for me in rounds 13 and 16.\n\n8. Another possibility is that they'll expect me to play rock again (since I've won with it) and counter with paper.\n\n9.
