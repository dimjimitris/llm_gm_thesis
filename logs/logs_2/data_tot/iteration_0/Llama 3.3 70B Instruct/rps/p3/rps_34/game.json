Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any information about the other player's move or strategy, I should choose a move that has a relatively high chance of winning or tying.\n4. Rock is a common starting move, as it beats scissors, which is also a common move. However, paper beats rock, so I should consider the risk.\n5. Scissors is a relatively safe move, as it only loses to rock, but it also has a low payoff when winning.\n6. Paper has a high payoff when winning but loses to scissors.\n\nConsidering the payoffs and the lack of information about the other player's strategy, I will choose a move that balances the risk and potential reward.\n[move] (Choosing a common starting move with moderate risk and reward) rock\n",

If I choose paper and the other player chose scissors, I lose 1 point. If I choose paper and the other player chose paper, it's a tie.\n5.

Rock has a payoff of 1 and a penalty of -3, paper has a payoff of 3 and a penalty of -1, and scissors has a payoff of 1 and a penalty of -1.\n8.

Choosing paper has a high payoff if the other player chooses rock, but a relatively low penalty if the other player chooses scissors.\n9.
