    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If that's the case, we might need to think several steps ahead to gain an advantage.\n\nPsychologist: Alternatively, our opponent may be using a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account our previous moves and adjusts their strategy accordingly.

Perhaps we could choose a move that is based on a deeper understanding of the game and its mechanics, while also taking into account our opponent's potential strategy.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): After considering all the factors, I think we should try to make a move that is based on the fundamental principles of the game, while also trying to throw off our opponent's prediction. Since rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock, we could try to make a move that will result in a win, regardless of whether our opponent mirrors us or not.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree, and we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the outcome of this round.\n\nPsychologist: I concur.

This is the twenty-ninth consecutive tie, which suggests that our opponent is still able to consistently match our moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the twenty-nine consecutive ties, it's clear that our opponent is using a strategy that is highly effective at mirroring our moves. We need to think of a new way to break the tie, and consider the possibility that our opponent may be using a more advanced strategy.\n\nPsychologist: Our opponent's ability to mirror our moves so consistently suggests that they may be using a strategy that involves predicting our moves based on our past behavior. We should try to think of a way to exploit this strategy and gain an advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): Considering these possibilities, I think we should try to make a move that will result in a win, while also trying to throw off our opponent's prediction. Since we've been trying to outsmart our opponent and failed, maybe it's time to try a different approach.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a good idea, but we should also make sure that our move is still strategic and takes into account the potential moves our opponent might make. A move that is too predictable or obvious might not be the best approach.\n\nPsychologist: I agree with the Game Theorist. We should try to find a balance between making a move that will result in a win and making a strategic move.
