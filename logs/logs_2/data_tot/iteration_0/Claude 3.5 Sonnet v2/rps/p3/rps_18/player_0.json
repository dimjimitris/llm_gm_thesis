You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Every strategic approach I've tried has been thoroughly countered - whether analyzing patterns, making direct counters, maintaining consistency, or trying to be unpredictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors to counter their paper play, though their demonstrated ability to stay ahead of my thinking throughout this game suggests they've likely already anticipated this move. They've proven to be an exceptionally skilled opponent who seems to read my strategy no matter what approach I take.\n"
