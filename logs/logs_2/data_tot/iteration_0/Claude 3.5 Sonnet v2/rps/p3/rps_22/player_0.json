    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Medium reward (+1)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Medium reward (+1)\n- Same moves: No points (0)\n- Losing moves: Corresponding negative points\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on historical patterns. However, studies show that \"rock\" is often a common first move for many players, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, paper would be the optimal choice if the opponent plays rock:\n- If they play rock: we get +3\n- If they play paper: we get 0\n- If they play scissors: we get -1\nThe expected value is positive if we assume rock is slightly more likely as a first move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. It gives us the highest potential reward (+3), and in worst case we only lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might also be using a similar strategic approach\n2. They might switch to scissors now, anticipating we'll play paper again\n3. They might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the opponent's perspective:\n- They might expect us to avoid paper since it was just played\n- They might expect us to play scissors to beat their previous paper\n- They might try to counter this by playing rock\n\nRisk Manager: Given these possibilities, let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play scissors: Win (+1) vs paper, Lose (-3) vs rock, Tie (0) vs scissors\n- If we play rock: Win (+1) vs scissors, Lose (-3) vs paper, Tie (0) vs rock\n- If we play paper: Win (+3) vs rock, Lose (-1) vs scissors, Tie (0) vs paper\n\nGame Strategist: Since they played paper first (like us), they might be using similar strategic thinking. In this case, rock would be a safer play as it:\n1. Protects against potential scissors (which is a common counter to previous paper)\n2. Only risks -3 against paper, but paper is less likely since it was just played\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock. While it has a higher potential loss (-3), it protects against the most likely opponent move (scissors), and could catch them if they try to be too clever by playing scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 2: Both played rock (tie)\nThis suggests the opponent might be using similar logical patterns to ours, or they're mirroring our moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The sequence paper \u2192 rock is a common progression as we saw. Now we're at a crucial decision point. Looking at the pattern:\n- The opponent has been matching our moves (intentionally or coincidentally)\n- They've shown conservative play so far\n- They might expect us to complete the classic \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence with scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the current situation:\n1. If we play scissors:\n   - Could be predictable as it completes the sequence\n   - Vulnerable to rock (-3)\n2. If we play paper:\n   - Beats rock (+3)\n   - Safe against another rock-rock standoff\n3. If we play rock:\n   - Could catch them if they finally try scissors (+1)\n   - Vulnerable to paper (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've seen two consecutive ties with matching moves, I suggest breaking the pattern decisively. Paper would be optimal because:\n- It beats the previous move (rock)\n- Has the highest potential gain (+3)\n- If they're mirroring us, we'll get another tie (0)\n- If they try to break pattern with scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree.

The opponent:\n- Seems to be playing more reactively than strategically\n- Might be frustrated after losing and looking to counter our winning paper move\n- Has shown a tendency to stay with basic patterns\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, let's evaluate our options:\n1. If we play paper again:\n   - Too risky as they're likely to counter with scissors\n   - Could be seen as overconfident after our win\n2.

Stay with scissors expecting opponent to switch\n2. Switch to rock to beat expected scissors\n3. Switch to paper to beat expected rock\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate options:\n1.

I suggest scissors because:\n- It's the logical counter to paper, but that's exactly why they might not expect us to make the \"obvious\" play\n- If they're truly mirroring, they'll need to see our move first\n- Breaking the mirroring pattern is crucial at this point\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

If we play paper:\n   - Beats rock if they play defensively (+3)\n   - Could catch them if they expect us to repeat rock\n   - Vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n3. If we play scissors:\n   - Could surprise them\n   - Worked well recently\n   - Vulnerable to rock (-3)\n\nPattern Analyst: After losing to rock:\n- Players typically avoid scissors\n- Often play paper to counter repeated rock\n- Might also play rock as a \"reset\" move\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper because:\n1. Opponent likely to abandon scissors after losing to rock\n2. They might expect us to stay with winning rock\n3. Even if they predict this and play scissors, we only lose 1 point\n4. Has highest potential payoff (+3)\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Paper is the optimal choice:\n- Best risk-reward ratio\n- Anticipates opponent's likely adaptation\n- With +8 points, we can afford some calculated risk\n- Shows we're still reading their strategy well\n\n[move] paper\n"
