    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent game history:\n- Round 21: paper tie (0)\n- Round 22: rock tie (0)\n- Round 23: scissors tie (0)\n- Round 24: paper tie (0)\n- Total score: -8 points\n- Four consecutive ties!\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n- Opponent has matched EVERY move\n- Sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n- They might be:\n  * Reading my moves perfectly\n  * Using a mirroring strategy\n  * Setting up for a decisive break\n\n3. Psychological pressure:\n- Four ties is extremely unusual\n- Both players must break this pattern\n- Opponent has shown incredible prediction/matching\n- They might expect me to make dramatic change\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n- Cannot continue this tie pattern\n- Opponent has proven they can read/match my moves\n- They might break pattern this round\n- Need unexpected move to break their reading ability\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n- After paper tie, most players would:\n  * Use scissors to beat paper\n  * Or keep paper expecting a switch\n- But this opponent is exceptional at predictions\n- They might expect me to:\n  * Use scissors as obvious choice\n  * Or rock to counter expected scissors\n- Need to think several steps ahead\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock. Reasoning:\n- Unexpected move after paper tie\n- Breaks both the mirroring and conventional responses\n- Beats scissors if they try to punish paper play\n- Even if they predict this with paper, taking -3 risk is needed\n- Must break this tie sequence with bold move\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n- Opponent is showing extraordinary mirroring ability\n- They've matched: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n- This is beyond coincidence\n- They must have a systematic way to read my moves\n\n3.

Breaking the pattern:\n- Normal strategic thinking isn't working\n- Need to move beyond conventional game theory\n- Must make a truly random choice\n- Cannot use logical progression\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n- Will deliberately NOT think through obvious choices\n- Will NOT try to counter what they might expect\n- Will NOT follow any pattern from previous moves\n- Will make instinctive choice to break their reading ability\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors.
