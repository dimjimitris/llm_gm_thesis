    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing optimal choice:\n   - If I choose paper, I could win 3 points or lose 1 point\n   - If I choose rock, I could win 1 point or lose 3 points\n   - If I choose scissors, I could win 1 point or lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategy consideration:\n   - Since it's the first move, opponent might choose rock as it's a common first choice\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - Even if I lose with paper, I only lose 1 point\n\n5.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Round 24: Won with scissors vs paper (+1)\n   - Round 25: Won with paper vs rock (+3)\n   - I'm on a two-win streak\n   - Momentum has shifted strongly\n   - Successfully predicted their last two moves\n\n2. Current momentum:\n   - Scored 4 points in last two rounds\n   - Broke out of losing streak decisively\n   - Opponent has lost twice in a row\n   - They might be feeling pressured\n   - Their predictable counters aren't working\n\n3. Opponent's psychology:\n   - They've lost to both scissors and paper\n   - They're likely frustrated after consecutive losses\n   - Might abandon conservative rock play\n   - Could become more aggressive to break their losing streak\n   - Might expect me to be overconfident\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - They likely expect me to stick with paper after big win\n   - Scissors would be their obvious counter to paper\n   - They might overthink and play paper expecting my scissors\n   - Need to stay ahead of their predictions\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - High probability they'll play scissors to counter potential paper repeat\n   - Paper would be too obvious after success\n   - Playing scissors would be too risky\n   - Rock here would:\n   * Beat their likely scissors play\n   * Be unexpected after paper success\n   * Protect against their potential aggressive counter\n   * Show strategic flexibility\n   - Rock is safest play with good winning chance\n\n[move] rock\n"
