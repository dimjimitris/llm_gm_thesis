    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Statistical Analyst - For probability analysis and pattern recognition\n3. Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and decision-making\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point for winning. However, losing with rock or paper against paper or scissors respectively has a higher penalty (-3 points).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. In such cases, we should consider the base probabilities. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, players might be slightly more inclined to choose paper for its higher reward potential.\n\nPsychology Expert: With a fresh player and first move, players often default to 'rock' as it's psychologically perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is known as the \"rock bias\" in RPS. However, since this is an AI game context, the opponent might be aware of this bias.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, I suggest playing paper. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays rock (common first move), we get maximum points (+3)\n2. If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n3. If opponent plays scissors, we lose minimum points (-1)\nThis provides a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Paper has the best expected value in this situation given the payoff structure and the likelihood of facing rock as a first move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Concur with paper as the optimal choice. It exploits the common \"rock bias\" while minimizing potential losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now, let's analyze the situation for the second round.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing to paper, many players tend to switch to scissors as a direct counter. This is a common psychological response - players often try to counter what beat them in the previous round. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this thinking and stick with rock or switch to paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If opponent switches to scissors (common reaction): we should play rock\n2. If opponent predicts our thinking and plays paper: rock would lose badly (-3)\n3. If opponent stays with rock: paper would win again (+3)\n\nGame Strategist: Given the high-stakes nature of the paper outcome (+3/-3), we should be more conservative this round. The opponent just lost -3 points and might be more risk-averse. I suggest playing rock as it:\n- Beats scissors (likely counter to our previous paper)\n- Only risks -3 against paper\n- Ties against rock\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock. After a significant loss, players often try to \"counter\" the previous winning move, making scissors a likely choice. Additionally, they might be hesitant to use rock again after just losing with it.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The expected value calculation supports this. Given the higher probability of scissors in this situation, rock provides the best risk-adjusted return.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's analyze the current situation carefully.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial moment psychologically. The opponent has lost twice and will likely be more aggressive in their strategy. After losing to rock, many players avoid scissors in the next round. Additionally, they might be trying to detect a pattern in our plays: we went paper->rock, so they might expect scissors from us following this progression.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's look at our sequence and potential opponent thinking:\n1. Round 1: We played paper, won against rock (+3)\n2. Round 2: We played rock, won against scissors (+1)\n3. Round 3: If we followed the apparent rotation, we'd play scissors...\n\nGame Strategist: However, this is exactly what we should avoid. The opponent might be expecting us to complete the cycle with scissors. After two losses, they're likely to try to break their losing streak with a bold move. I suggest we play rock again because:\n- If they expect scissors from us and play paper, rock minimizes our loss (-3)\n- If they try to beat our expected scissors with rock, our rock ties (0)\n- If they play scissors again hoping to catch us with paper, we win (+1)\n\nPsychology Expert: I disagree slightly. After two losses, especially with the last one being against rock, the opponent is very unlikely to play scissors again. They're more likely to play paper to beat our potential rock, especially since rock just won for us.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree with the Psychology Expert. The probability of them playing paper seems highest in this round. Given this, we should play scissors. It would:\n- Beat their likely paper play (+1)\n- Only lose minimally to rock (-1)\n- Tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Strategist: The Statistical Analyst makes a compelling case. The risk-reward ratio for scissors is better in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've won three consecutive rounds with perfect predictions (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), scoring +3, +1, and +1 points respectively. This is a very interesting situation.\n\nPsychology Expert: We're dealing with a psychologically challenging situation for our opponent. They've lost three times in a row, and our last three moves have been paper, rock, and scissors in that order. This creates two strong psychological pressures:\n1. Desperate desire to break the losing streak\n2. Pattern recognition - they might think we're either:\n   - Going to start the cycle again with paper\n   - Or try to be unpredictable by breaking the pattern\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze the opponent's possible thinking:\n1. They might expect us to restart with paper (following our sequence)\n2. They might expect us to avoid paper (breaking the obvious pattern)\n3. They've lost to all three possible moves now, which might make their choice more random\n4. Previous moves: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper (their sequence)\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical decision point. I suggest rock because:\n1. If they expect us to play paper and try scissors, we win (+1)\n2. If they try to break their losing streak with paper, we lose but minimize damage (-3)\n3. If they play rock, we tie (0)\n\nPsychology Expert: I disagree. After losing to scissors, and seeing our full paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors sequence, they're most likely to expect us to either repeat paper or play scissors again. In this heightened emotional state of consecutive losses, they're likely to play rock as it feels like a \"strong\" move to break a losing streak and would beat our potential scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The Psychology Expert's analysis aligns with game theory here. Paper would be our optimal choice because:\n1. Beats their likely rock play (+3)\n2. Ties against paper (0)\n3. Loses to scissors (-1)\nThe expected value is highest with paper, considering the psychological factors.\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological analysis is convincing.

Just lost with rock against paper for the second time (-3 points both times)\n3. Has seen us make seemingly predictable yet winning moves\n4.

We've completed a full cycle and returned to paper\n2. They've also shown a pattern, returning to rock\n3. They've lost heavily to paper twice (-6 points total from just those moves)\n\nGame Strategist: Given the opponent's significant losses to paper, they're extremely unlikely to play rock again. The most probable responses are:\n1. Scissors - to decisively beat paper (their biggest problem)\n2. Paper - to break away from their losing rock moves\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly believe they will play scissors this round. The -6 points lost to paper will make them absolutely adverse to playing rock, and they'll want to finally beat the move that has cost them the most points.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed. The probability of scissors is highest this round:\n1. Natural counter to our previous paper\n2. Emotional response to their paper losses\n3.

Completely random play to be unpredictable\n2. Return to basic, fundamental strategies\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing to rock with scissors, there's a strong psychological tendency to avoid scissors. They've also seen us alternate between paper and rock in our last two moves. They might expect another alternation to paper. In this highly frustrated state, they're likely to:\n1. Avoid scissors (just lost with it)\n2. Avoid rock (lost badly to paper twice)\n3. Therefore, paper becomes their most likely play\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

The psychological pressure to finally win will make them want to \"catch\" us following our pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agree with the Psychology Expert. The probability of them playing scissors to counter our expected paper is highest by far.

The opponent just had their first \"success\" with rock. Players often stick to what finally worked for them, especially after a long losing streak. I suggest scissors to punish their likely paper play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After further consideration, I agree with the Game Strategist.

Scissors would be risky for them as it ties with our last move\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly believe they'll play rock because:\n1. It's their most recent \"non-losing\" move\n2. It beats our last-played scissors\n3. It feels like a safe, defensive choice after their paper just lost\n4. They need to rebuild confidence\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agree. Historical data shows that after losing to scissors, rock is the most common response, especially when the player had recently had some success with rock (the tie in this case).\n\nGame Strategist: The analysis clearly points to paper as our optimal play:\n1. Beats their highly probable rock play (+3)\n2. Safe against scissors (-1)\n3. Ties with paper (0)\n4. Maximizes our potential points against their most likely move\n\nAll personas agree: Paper is the strongest play given the opponent's likely psychological state and recent game history.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

We just won with paper against rock again.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's psychological state is now critical:\n1. Lost heavily to paper again (-3 points)\n2. Brief hope from the tie is completely gone\n3. Has lost to paper multiple times now (-3 points each time)\n4. Must be feeling extremely frustrated and potentially:\n   - Angry at falling for paper again\n   - Determined to not lose to paper again\n   - Likely to make an emotional rather than strategic decision\n\nStatistical Analyst: Pattern analysis:\n1. Paper has been our most successful move (+3 points each time)\n2. Opponent has lost most heavily to paper\n3. They've shown a consistent vulnerability to paper\n4. After losing to paper, players almost always avoid rock in the next round\n\nGame Strategist: Given their multiple heavy losses to paper, they're extremely likely to:\n1. Avoid rock completely (just lost -3 to paper again)\n2. Want to punish paper with scissors\n3. Consider paper only as a distant third option\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. The psychological aversion to rock after multiple -3 losses to paper, combined with the emotional desire to finally punish our paper plays, makes scissors their most likely move by far.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The probability distribution heavily favors scissors from their side:\n1. Natural counter to paper (which just beat them)\n2. Emotional satisfaction of beating the move that cost them most points\n3. Historical data shows very high probability of scissors after losing to paper multiple times\n\nGame Strategist: The analysis overwhelmingly points to rock as our optimal play:\n1. Beats their highly probable scissors play (+1)\n2. Safe against rock (0)\n3.

Rock just beat their scissors\n2. They might expect us to stay with rock (since it won)\n3. Or expect us to play paper (following our paper\u2192rock alternation)\n4. They're likely to avoid scissors (just lost with it)\n\nPsychology Expert: In such extreme losing situations, players often revert to paper because:\n1. It's the \"middle ground\" move\n2. Beats rock (which just beat them)\n3. Feels less aggressive than scissors\n4. Hasn't lost as recently as scissors\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agree. When players have lost multiple times with both rock and scissors, they statistically tend to try paper as a \"fresh start\" strategy. Also, paper would beat our previous winning move (rock).\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, scissors is our optimal play:\n1. Beats their likely paper play (+1)\n2.
