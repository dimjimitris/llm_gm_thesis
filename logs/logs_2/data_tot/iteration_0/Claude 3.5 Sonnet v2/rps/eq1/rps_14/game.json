Pattern evolution:\n   - They've moved from rock/paper alternation\n   - To consecutive paper plays\n   - This shows significant strategy change\n   - They're becoming less predictable\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Two consecutive ties might:\n     * Build their confidence in paper\n     * Make them feel safe\n     * Create false sense of security\n     * Make them resistant to change\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - If they stick with paper: scissors wins\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins\n   - If they finally try scissors: rock wins\n   - Their three consecutive paper plays suggest possible overconfidence\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their new pattern of paper persistence\n   - Their possible overconfidence from avoiding losses\n   - The success I've had with scissors against paper\n   - Their continued avoidance of scissors\n   - Scissors would be optimal to punish their likely paper continuation\n\n[move] scissors\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
