    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in competitive settings\n\nLet's start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their tendencies. The Nash equilibrium for rock-paper-scissors suggests each move should be played with equal 1/3 probability for optimal results.\n\nPsychology Expert: Studies show that in the first round, many players tend to choose \"rock\" as their initial move. This is because \"rock\" is often perceived as a strong, stable choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we have no historical data yet, we can't make predictions based on patterns. However, we should carefully observe this first move to start building our understanding.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the scoring system (+1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for tie), we should consider that no move is inherently riskier than others. Each move has equal potential for win/loss/tie.\n\nGame Strategist: Considering the Psychology Expert's input about \"rock\" being a common first move, we could counter that by playing \"paper\".\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Playing \"paper\" gives us an edge if the opponent follows the common tendency, while not putting us at any particular disadvantage if they don't.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk is managed as the scoring system is symmetric, so this seems like a reasonable approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on analysis of common first-move tendencies in rock-paper-scissors\n"

A sophisticated player who anticipated the \"paper\" counter to common \"rock\" opening\n2. Someone who naturally favors scissors as their opening move\n\nPsychology Expert: After a winning move, players often have two common tendencies:\n1. Stick with their winning move (scissors in this case)\n2. Rotate to the next move in sequence (rock in this case)\nThe second tendency is more common as players try to stay \"one step ahead.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, we should consider playing rock for two reasons:\n1. It counters scissors if they stick with their winning move\n2. It ties with rock if they make the common rotation\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent's decisive first move suggests they might be an experienced player. We should be prepared to adapt our strategy based on their next move, but for now, rock seems like our safest option with the highest expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Additionally, after losing a round, many players tend to choose rock as it's perceived as a \"strong\" move to recover from a loss. Our opponent might anticipate this and try to counter it with paper, but based on their first move showing strategic thinking, they're more likely to expect us to overthink and make a different choice.\n\nGame Strategist: The consensus seems clear. Playing rock gives us the best odds based on both psychological and strategic analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on analysis of post-win behavior patterns and strategic position\n"

A strong preference for scissors\n2. A strategy to establish a pattern before breaking it\n3. A simple coincidence\n\nPsychology Expert: Having just lost twice in a row, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Finally abandon scissors due to consecutive losses\n2. Feel frustrated and potentially make a more emotional decision\n3. Try to outsmart us by expecting us to counter scissors again\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown themselves to be predictable so far, but this could be a setup for a sudden change. Let's analyze our options:\n1. Rock - Won last time, but might be too obvious\n2. Paper - Risky if they stick to scissors\n3. Scissors - Would tie if they persist, win if they switch to paper\n\nRisk Manager: We're currently at 0 points total (-1+1). The opponent might be desperate to win this round. This desperation often leads to a complete strategy change.\n\nPsychology Expert: The \"gambler's fallacy\" might lead them to think \"scissors can't lose three times in a row,\" encouraging them to finally switch. Most likely to paper, trying to beat our expected rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, scissors appears to be our best move because:\n1. It protects against paper if they try to counter our previous rock\n2. It results in a tie if they stubbornly stick to scissors\n3. It only loses to rock, which would be their least likely choice given the psychological factors\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Scissors offers the best risk-reward profile in this situation, with a good chance of win or tie, and protection against the most likely opponent move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on opponent's history and psychological analysis of likely strategy shift\n"

In such states, players often:\n1. Return to their \"comfort move\" (possibly scissors for this player)\n2. Try to completely randomize to become unpredictable\n3. Attempt to counter what just beat them (rock to beat our scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can adapt, but they're now in a defensive position psychologically. They've experienced each move now (scissors twice, then paper), except rock.\n\nRisk Manager: We're at +2 points total (-1+1+1). With a winning streak, we should be cautious of overconfidence but also recognize our successful reading of the opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the psychological pressure on the opponent, rock is likely their next move because:\n1. They haven't used it yet\n2. It's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move when under pressure\n3. It would beat our scissors if they think we'll stick with our winning move\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree.

Try to \"win\" the deadlock by sticking to the same move\n2. Switch to what would have beaten the tied move\n3. Assume their opponent will switch and plan accordingly\n\nRisk Manager: We're still at +2 points total (-1+1+1+0). The tie maintains our lead but shows our opponent might be improving at reading our strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they maintain their \"double move\" pattern, they might be due for a change since they've now played paper twice.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might make them feel they've \"figured us out,\" potentially leading to overconfidence. However, their historical tendency to repeat moves twice is our strongest signal.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I believe they're most likely to switch away from paper after using it twice. The most aggressive choice would be scissors, as it:\n1. Follows their apparent comfort with this move (used in rounds 1-2)\n2. Would beat paper if we stick with it\n3. Represents an aggressive attempt to break the tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

Attempt to \"outsmart\" by thinking multiple levels ahead\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown a strong preference for scissors (3 times) and paper (2 times), but has notably never played rock.

This pattern has become costly for them.\n\nGame Strategist: After this many rounds without using rock, there are only two likely scenarios:\n1. They're stubbornly committed to never using rock, making them highly predictable\n2. They're finally at the breaking point where they must use rock\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure is at its peak:\n1. Multiple losses with their preferred move (scissors)\n2. Inability to win with their alternative move (paper)\n3. The obvious absence of rock in their strategy\n4. The clear failure of their current approach\n\nRisk Manager: Given their mounting frustration and the complete failure of their current strategy, this seems like the most likely moment for them to finally use rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on prediction that the opponent has finally reached the absolute breaking point and will use rock for the first time\n"
