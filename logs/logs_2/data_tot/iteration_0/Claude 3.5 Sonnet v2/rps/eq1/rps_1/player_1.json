    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Decision Maker - For making final move decisions based on inputs\n4. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to work with. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without any previous moves to analyze, we can't identify any patterns in the opponent's behavior. However, some players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: In terms of risk-reward, all moves have equal potential for winning or losing. Since we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, we should aim for a balanced approach.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inputs from all personas, I suggest we go with 'paper' for the following reasons:\n1. It counters the common 'rock' first move\n2. It's a balanced choice that doesn't reveal any particular strategy\n3. Without prior information, any choice has equal mathematical expectation, so psychological factors can be considered\n\nDoes everyone agree with this reasoning?\n\nGame Strategist: The logic is sound. While all moves have equal theoretical value, the psychological insight about 'rock' being a common first move makes 'paper' a reasonable choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might:\n1. Change their strategy after losing\n2. Stick to rock believing we won by luck\n3. Try to predict our next move assuming we might play paper again\n\nGame Strategist: After a loss, players often change their strategy. Since we played paper and won, they might expect us to play paper again, making scissors an attractive option for them.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent now knows we played paper last time. If they're strategic, they're more likely to play scissors to counter our previous paper. Therefore, playing paper again would be risky.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these analyses:\n1. If they expect us to play paper again, they'll play scissors\n2. If they're trying to counter our expected counter to their potential scissors, they might play rock\n3. The safest play would be rock, as it:\n   - Beats scissors (their most likely move to counter our previous paper)\n   - Ties with rock (if they repeat their move)\n   - Only loses to paper (which seems less likely given the game state)\n\nGame Strategist: Agree with the reasoning. Rock provides the best risk-adjusted outcome based on likely opponent psychology.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've now won two rounds and have more data about our opponent:\nRound 1: They played rock, we won with paper\nRound 2: They played scissors, we won with rock\nTheir pattern suggests they're making logical transitions: rock \u2192 scissors, possibly trying to counter our previous moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent appears to be using a reactive strategy, changing their move each time after losing. They went from rock to scissors, following a logical sequence. If they continue this pattern, paper would be their next logical move to beat our rock.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has lost twice now. This often leads to either:\n1. More aggressive/unpredictable play due to frustration\n2. Or a more calculated approach to break their losing streak\nGiven they've shown logical thinking so far, the second scenario seems more likely.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. If they continue their logical sequence, they'll play paper to beat our rock\n2. They might expect us to predict this and try to outthink us\n3. They haven't used paper yet, making it a likely choice\n\nGiven these factors, I suggest we play scissors because:\n- It beats paper (their most logical next move)\n- If they try to outthink us and go back to rock, we only lose one point after gaining two\n- It continues our unpredictable yet logical sequence (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: Agree.

They might now realize we've been correctly predicting their moves, which could lead to a dramatic strategy change.\n\nRisk Assessor: This is a critical moment:\n1. We've won three times in a row\n2. The opponent has shown a predictable pattern\n3. They're likely to completely change their strategy now that the pattern is obvious\n4. The psychological pressure on them is immense after three losses\n\nDecision Maker: Let's consider the possibilities:\n1. They might abandon their systematic approach entirely\n2. They could try to use our own successful sequence against us (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors)\n3. They might overthink and try multiple levels of mind games\n4. They could resort to a completely random choice out of frustration\n\nGiven that they've shown logical thinking but have been outplayed, they're most likely to:\na) Either copy our winning sequence (making them play paper)\nb) Or make a completely unexpected choice to break their losing streak\n\nI suggest we play rock because:\n- It beats scissors (if they copy our sequence)\n- It's not what we played last time (breaking our own pattern)\n- It's a strong defensive move if they're going random\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

It broke our winning streak\n2. It shows they've abandoned their previous pattern\n3. They might gain confidence from stopping their losing streak\n4. They might view rock as their \"safe\" move since it at least didn't lose\n\nRisk Assessor: After a tie with rock-rock:\n1. Many players stick with rock again, viewing it as a \"safe\" option\n2. Others assume their opponent will switch to paper to beat rock\n3. The psychological relief of not losing might make them more aggressive\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. If they stay with rock (seeking safety) \u2192 paper wins\n2. If they predict we'll play paper and switch to scissors \u2192 rock wins\n3.

Their use of scissors after losses has become a tell\n\nRisk Assessor: Current situation:\n1. We're in an almost unbeatable position\n2. The opponent is likely completely demoralized\n3. They might either become totally random or totally predictable\n4. Their last three moves (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) suggest desperation\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze:\n1. After losing with scissors:\n   - Historical pattern suggests they might play paper\n   - They might try to break their obvious patterns\n   - They could revert to rock as their \"comfort move\"\n   - They might realize we've been predicting them successfully\n2. Psychologically:\n   - They're likely feeling completely outmatched\n   - Their strategy has completely fallen apart\n   - They might try something entirely different\n   - They might give up on strategy and play randomly\n\nI recommend playing scissors because:\n- It counters paper (their historical pattern after losing with scissors)\n- It's unexpected since we just won with rock\n- At this point, maintaining our unpredictability is key\n- Even if they play rock, our dominant position means we can afford a loss\n- It continues our strategy of staying one step ahead of their thinking\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Scissors maintains our psychological advantage while covering their most likely moves based on their pattern of behavior under pressure.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've won their second round\n2. Rock has been their most successful move\n3. They might gain confidence from this win\n4. Their return to rock worked well for them\n\nRisk Assessor: Key considerations:\n1. They might be regaining confidence\n2. Their success with rock might influence their next move\n3. They've broken our winning streak\n4. The psychological dynamics have shifted slightly\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze:\n1. After winning with rock:\n   - They might stick with their successful move\n   - They might expect us to play paper to counter potential rock\n   - They could try to build on their success with a new strategy\n2. Psychologically:\n   - Their confidence is likely boosted\n   - They've seen rock work against us\n   - They might think they've finally found our weakness\n\nI recommend playing rock because:\n- If they're confident, they might play scissors to counter our expected paper\n- If they try to overthink, they might play scissors thinking we'll expect them to play rock again\n- Rock has been historically successful for us\n- It protects against their potential aggressive play with scissors\n- It's unexpected since they might think we'll play paper to counter their successful rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Their success with rock might make them overconfident and aggressive, making scissors their likely next move. Rock is our best counter to this psychology.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Rock seems to be their comfort zone (3 recent uses)\n2. The tie maintains the current momentum\n3. Their recent success (win + tie) might reinforce their strategy\n4. Rock has become their anchor move\n\nRisk Assessor: Important factors:\n1. They haven't lost with rock in the last few rounds\n2. The tie might encourage them to stick with rock\n3. However, they might expect us to counter with paper\n4. Their confidence is likely stable after recent results\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze deeply:\n1. After a rock-rock tie:\n   - Historical patterns suggest many players stick with rock\n   - They might expect us to play paper to beat their rock\n   - They've had recent success with rock (win + tie)\n2. Psychologically:\n   - They're likely feeling more comfortable\n   - Rock has become their \"safe\" move\n   - They might try to outthink us by countering our expected paper\n\nHowever, I recommend we play paper because:\n- Their recent pattern strongly favors rock\n- They've shown a tendency to stick with what works\n- The psychological comfort of rock is very strong now\n- Even if they try to counter with scissors, we're still well ahead\n- They might overthink and expect us to play rock again for another tie\n\nGame Strategist: Agree with playing paper. Their demonstrated preference for rock, especially in pressure situations, makes it the most likely move. The psychological comfort they've found with rock makes it hard for them to deviate now.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their rock strategy has finally failed them\n2. They've become extremely predictable\n3. They've lost after a brief period of success\n4.

They might be feeling frustrated after losing with their \"safe\" move\n4. Their pattern is too obvious to continue\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze:\n1. After losing with rock:\n   - They MUST change from rock\n   - They know we'll expect them to change\n   - They might try scissors to counter our successful paper\n   - They might try paper as it's their least used recent move\n2. Psychologically:\n   - They're forced to abandon their comfort move\n   - They're likely feeling exposed and predictable\n   - They need to surprise us\n   - They might be frustrated and make an aggressive move\n\nI recommend playing rock because:\n- They're most likely to play scissors as an aggressive counter to our paper\n- They know they can't play rock again\n- They might try to punish our successful paper play\n- If they try paper instead, we can afford a loss given our strong lead\n- It counters their most likely emotional response\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

They might be reaching maximum frustration\n4. Their strategic thinking appears compromised\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze:\n1. After losing with scissors:\n   - They might try paper as their only unused recent option\n   - They might return to rock out of desperation\n   - They know we've been predicting them successfully\n   - They need something unpredictable\n2. Psychologically:\n   - They're likely feeling completely read\n   - Their frustration level is probably very high\n   - They might abandon pattern-based play entirely\n   - They need a successful move badly\n\nI recommend playing scissors because:\n- Paper is their most logical choice as it's:\n  * Their least recently used move\n  * Different from their failed scissors\n  * A fresh strategy they haven't tried recently\n- Even if they play rock, we're far ahead in points\n- It continues our strategy of staying one step ahead\n- It counters their most likely \"fresh start\" strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

They're likely in maximum frustration mode\n2. All their recent strategies have failed\n3. They might make an emotional rather than logical choice\n4. They might try to copy our successful moves\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze:\n1.

Rock has been their most frequent choice\n2. They seem to return to rock after failures\n3. The tie might give them some small confidence\n4. Rock appears to be their \"reset\" move\n\nRisk Assessor: Key considerations:\n1. After ties, they often stick with rock\n2. They might expect us to play paper now\n3. The tie breaks their losing streak\n4. Rock remains their comfort zone\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze deeply:\n1. After a rock-rock tie:\n   - Historical data shows they often stick with rock\n   - They might expect us to play paper to counter repeated rock\n   - The tie might reinforce their trust in rock\n2. Psychologically:\n   - The tie provides some relief from constant losses\n   - They might feel rock is \"working\" (at least not losing)\n   - They might expect us to try paper, their most obvious counter\n   - They might try scissors to pre-empt our expected paper\n\nI recommend playing rock again because:\n- If they expect us to play paper, they'll play scissors\n- They're likely overthinking after the tie\n- Rock beats their probable scissors\n- Even if they play paper, we're still far ahead\n- They might expect us to switch moves after a tie\n- The psychological comfort of their rock might make them switch to scissors thinking we'll counter with paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

They've reverted to their comfort move (rock)\n2. The tie gives them a small respite\n3. We've seen this pattern before - after ties with rock, they often:\n   * Either stick with rock as \"safe\"\n   * Or expect us to play paper and counter with scissors\n\nRisk Assessor: Key factors:\n1. Rock has been their most common reset move\n2. Previous rock ties often led to them changing strategy\n3. They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n4. The tie might make them more comfortable taking risks\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze deeply:\n1. Historical patterns after rock ties show:\n   * They often expect us to play paper next\n   * They sometimes stick with rock\n   * They rarely play paper themselves after a rock tie\n2. Psychologically:\n   * The tie provides some stability\n   * They might feel they need to break the tie pattern\n   * They likely expect us to play paper to beat their rock\n   * They might try to get ahead of our thinking\n\nI recommend playing rock again because:\n- They're very likely to play scissors to:\n  * Counter our expected paper play\n  * Break the tie pattern\n  * Show aggressive intent\n- Rock has been effective against their post-tie strategies\n- They rarely play paper after rock ties\n- If they do stick with rock, we maintain stability\n- The psychological pressure might make them overaggressive\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Their historical behavior after rock ties, combined with their likely expectation of our paper play, makes scissors their most probable move. Rock provides optimal coverage against their likely responses.\n\n[move] rock\n"
