    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

After two rock ties, they might: 1) stick with rock following their tendency for move repetition, 2) expect me to switch to paper and therefore play scissors, or 3) switch to paper themselves to beat rock. Given their pattern of sticking with moves for several rounds (as seen with paper early game and scissors mid-game), I'll predict they'll stay with rock for at least one more round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now, after losing to paper, their past behavior suggests a few possibilities: 1) switch to scissors to counter paper directly, 2) switch to paper themselves (mirroring the successful move, as they've done before), or 3) stick with rock (though this is least likely after just losing with it). Given their tendency to mirror successful moves earlier in the game, but also their increased strategic adaptation in later rounds, I think they're most likely to go with scissors to counter my paper.
