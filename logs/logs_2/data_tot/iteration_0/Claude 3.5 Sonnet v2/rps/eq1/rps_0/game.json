My score stays at -3 points from those early rounds, but recently we've had an incredibly long streak of matching moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors because after a rock-rock tie, the standard response would be paper to beat rock. Given our long history of thinking alike (shown by the many recent ties), my opponent is likely also considering paper as the logical next move. By playing scissors, I'm hoping to beat their expected paper play. While this makes me vulnerable if they stick with rock, our recent pattern suggests we both tend to try to counter the previous move rather than sticking with it. The remarkable sequence of ties also suggests we need to try something less predictable to break this pattern.\n"

My score remains at -3 points from those early rounds, while recent rounds have shown we're consistently matching each other's strategic choices.\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock because after a scissors-scissors tie, the natural progression would be to play rock to beat scissors. While this might seem predictable given our pattern of matching thoughts, attempting to be too clever or break the pattern hasn't worked well in the past. Given our remarkable streak of thinking alike, there's a high probability they'll also choose rock, leading to another tie.

After losing twice, they're likely to change their strategy significantly rather than make small adjustments.\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock because:\n1. After losing to my paper, they might expect me to use paper again and thus play scissors\n2. If they're trying to break their losing streak, they might play scissors aggressively\n3. They might think I'm getting overconfident after two wins and try to counter what they expect to be an aggressive play\n4. Rock is a good defensive move that will protect against scissors while being safe against itself\n5. This maintains my strategy of not repeating my previous move, which has been successful\n",
