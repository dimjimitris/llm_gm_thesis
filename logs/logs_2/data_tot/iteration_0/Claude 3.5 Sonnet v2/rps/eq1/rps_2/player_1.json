    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable in a single isolated round:\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock but loses to scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper but loses to rock\n\n3. Since there's no historical data to base a decision on, I should consider:\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\"\n   - This might suggest playing paper to counter rock\n   - However, sophisticated players might anticipate this thinking\n\n4. Without any additional information, I should aim to be unpredictable.\n\n5. For this first move, I'll choose paper:\n   - It beats rock if the opponent makes the common \"first-move rock\" choice\n   - If they play scissors, I'll learn they might be more strategic\n   - If they play paper, it's a neutral outcome\n\n[move] paper\n"

Considering opponent's psychology:\n   - After losing to paper, they might:\n      a) Expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors\n      b) Switch to paper themselves\n      c) Stick with rock out of habit\n\n3. Evaluating my options:\n   - If I play paper again:\n      - Win if they stick with rock\n      - Lose if they adapt with scissors\n      - Tie if they switch to paper\n   - Most players don't like to lose the same way twice\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent likely wants to counter my previous winning move\n   - They probably expect me to repeat paper\n   - Scissors would be their logical counter\n   - Therefore, rock would be my best counter to their likely scissors\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I'll play rock to counter their probable scissors play\n   - This also protects against them sticking with rock (tie)\n   - Only vulnerable if they switch to paper\n\n[move] rock\n"
