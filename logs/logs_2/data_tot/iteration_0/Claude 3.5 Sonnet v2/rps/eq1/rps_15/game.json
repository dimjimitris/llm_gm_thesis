Since this is the first move:\n   - Players often choose rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\"\n   - If I expect them to play rock, paper would be the optimal counter\n   - However, they might anticipate this and choose scissors\n\n4. Without any additional information, I should avoid being too predictable.\n\n5.

Psychology for this round:\n   - After winning with rock, the opponent might:\n     a) Stick with the winning move (rock)\n     b) Expect me to counter their previous rock with paper, so they might switch to scissors\n     c) Make a completely different choice to be unpredictable\n\n3.

Given this analysis:\n   - The opponent succeeded with a basic strategy (rock)\n   - Many players tend to change moves after a success to avoid being predictable\n   - The safest counter to their potential mindset would be rock:\n     * Beats scissors if they try to counter my expected paper\n     * Ties with rock if they stick to their winning move\n     * Only loses to paper, which seems less likely\n\n[move] rock\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
