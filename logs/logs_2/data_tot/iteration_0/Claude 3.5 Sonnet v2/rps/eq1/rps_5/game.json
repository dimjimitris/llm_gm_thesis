In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable as initial choices:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n3. Without any historical data, each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n4. In this situation, a random but strategic choice is reasonable.\n\n5. Studies have shown that in RPS, rock is the most common opening move among players (roughly 35% of the time), likely because:\n   - Rock is perceived as \"strong\"\n   - It's often the first option people think of\n   - It's a comfortable gesture to make\n\n6. Given this psychological tendency, paper would be a good counter to a likely rock opening.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper to counter the statistical likelihood of a rock opening.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given we both played paper, the opponent might:\n   - Expect me to switch to something else\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my paper if I stick with it\n   - Or switch to rock thinking I'll choose scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect me to switch from paper, they might choose scissors\n   - Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors\n\n5. Psychological element:\n   - The opponent might overthink and try to be too clever\n   - Sometimes the unexpected move is to not change at all\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock as it protects against the likely scissors play while also being effective if they overthink and choose paper again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychology after a tie:\n   - Ties often break negative psychological spirals\n   - They might feel they've finally stopped the bleeding\n   - Their decision-making might be clearer now\n   - The tie gives them a moment to reset\n\n3.

Common behavior after ties:\n   - Players often switch moves after a tie\n   - Many expect their opponent to switch\n   - Some try to outsmart by not switching\n   - The tie creates a mini reset of strategy\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They might expect me to switch from paper\n   - They could play scissors anticipating my paper again\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll play scissors\n   - The tie has given them a chance to break their negative pattern\n\nFinal decision: After a tie, most players tend to switch their move.

Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock just beat their scissors\n   - They might expect me to stay with rock\n   - Paper would beat rock if they try to reset\n   - But they might also try scissors out of desperation\n\nFinal decision: Given their complete frustration and the tendency for players to return to rock as a \"reset\" move after multiple losses (especially after losing with scissors), I'll choose paper. Rock is their most likely choice as they try to stabilize and reset their strategy.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent situation analysis:\n   - 5-win streak just ended with a tie\n   - Both played paper last round\n   - First tie after long streak of decisive rounds\n   - This might give them a psychological boost\n\n2. Psychology after breaking a streak:\n   - The tie breaks their losing spiral\n   - They might feel relieved to stop the losses\n   - Their decision-making might become clearer\n   - Could regain some confidence\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - My recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - We ended up thinking alike last round\n   - This suggests similar strategic thinking\n\n4. Common post-tie behavior:\n   - Players typically switch moves after a tie\n   - Most expect their opponent to switch\n   - Some try to be clever by not switching\n   - The tie creates a strategic reset point\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - After a tie with paper, common responses are:\n     * Switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n     * Switch to rock expecting opponent's scissors\n     * Stay with paper hoping opponent overthinks\n   - The tie gives them a chance to reset strategy\n\nFinal decision: After a tie, most players switch their move. Given they finally broke their losing streak with paper, they're likely to feel more confident and make an aggressive play with scissors to beat potential repeated paper. I'll choose rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 3 rounds:\n     * Paper vs paper (tie)\n     * Rock vs rock (tie)\n     * Two consecutive ties\n   - History is repeating - similar to earlier game pattern\n\n2. Current situation:\n   - We're thinking very similarly again\n   - Two ties have reset the game momentum\n   - Previous winning/losing streaks are less relevant\n   - Playing field has leveled\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Double ties create interesting dynamics:\n     * Both players want to break the mirroring\n     * Neither wants a third tie\n     * There's pressure to outsmart opponent\n     * But also risk of overthinking\n\n4.

Strategic considerations:\n   - After double ties, players often:\n     * Try to break the synchronization\n     * Avoid obvious next moves\n     * Look for psychological advantage\n     * Make unexpected choices\n\nFinal decision: Given our rock tie and the natural progression, many would play paper next to beat rock. However, since we've been thinking alike and they might anticipate this obvious move, they're likely to play scissors to counter expected paper. I'll stay with rock to beat their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last three moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This sequence suggests they might complete the cycle with scissors\n   - They've been predictable in the last two rounds\n   - When they become predictable, they often change strategy\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost two rounds in a row\n   - Players often make significant strategy changes after multiple losses\n   - They might assume I'm getting overconfident with my wins\n   - They might try to break their own pattern to regain control\n\n4. Win streak considerations:\n   - My recent success came from good prediction of their moves\n   - Success can lead to overconfidence\n   - They might be expecting me to overthink their next move\n   - They might return to basics to break their losing streak\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play scissors to complete their cycle: rock wins\n   - If they play rock again (repeating): paper wins\n   - If they play paper to break pattern: scissors wins\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Given their two losses, they're likely to change strategy\n   - The most basic and powerful-feeling move is rock\n   - Players often return to rock when feeling pressured\n   - I'll continue with paper to maintain pressure\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - They successfully broke the tie sequence\n   - They might feel confident in their read\n   - They demonstrated they can predict standard progressions\n   - They might expect me to play defensively after this loss\n\n4. Their possible thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - They might consider repeating scissors after success\n   - They might anticipate me overthinking again\n   - They've shown ability to stay ahead of my strategy\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - Playing rock is the obvious counter to their scissors\n   - Playing paper would be risky after losing to scissors\n   - Playing scissors would be unexpected after losing to it\n   - They've shown they can predict obvious counters\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Since they've consistently stayed ahead of my logic\n   - And they'll likely expect rock as a counter\n   - I'll choose scissors\n   - This unexpected repeat move might catch them playing paper to beat expected rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable as initial choices:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n3. Without any historical data, each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n4. In this situation, a random but strategic choice is reasonable.\n\n5. Studies have shown that in RPS, rock is the most common opening move among players (roughly 35% of the time), likely because:\n   - Rock is perceived as \"strong\"\n   - It's often the first option people think of\n   - It's a comfortable gesture to make\n\n6. Given this psychological tendency, paper would be a good counter to a likely rock opening.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper to counter the statistical likelihood of a rock opening.\n\n[move] paper\n",

        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent history analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds:\n     * Rock vs rock (tie)\n     * Rock vs rock (tie)\n     * Won with rock vs their scissors\n     * Lost with scissors vs their rock\n   - They successfully predicted my move\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - They've used rock effectively twice now:\n     * Once as a tie\n     * Once to beat my scissors\n   - Rock has been a successful move for them\n   - They might feel confident with rock plays\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They just won after several ties and losses\n   - Their rock strategy worked well\n   - They might feel they've found a winning approach\n   - Winners often stick with what works\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - After winning with rock, they might:\n     * Stick with rock (momentum)\n     * Expect me to play paper to counter rock\n     * Try to stay ahead of my thinking\n   - Rock has been prominent in recent rounds\n\n5. Meta-strategy:\n   - If they stick with rock, paper wins\n   - If they expect paper and play scissors, rock wins\n   - If they try to be clever and play paper, scissors wins\n   - Given their success with rock, they might be overconfident\n\nFinal decision: While they might expect me to play paper to counter their successful rock, their recent success with rock and general tendency to stick with working strategies suggests they'll play rock again. I'll choose paper to beat their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"
