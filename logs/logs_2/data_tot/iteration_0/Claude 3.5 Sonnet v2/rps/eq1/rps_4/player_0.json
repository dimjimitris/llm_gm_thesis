    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Analyst - For understanding opponent psychology\n3. Statistical Expert - For probability analysis\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have prior history to base our decision on. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, each move should have equal probability of being chosen (1/3) to maintain unpredictability.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: In the first move of rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their opening move. This is because rock is perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable.\" Studies suggest this happens roughly 35-40% of the time.\n\nStatistical Expert: Given the behavioral tendency towards rock as first move, we might consider playing paper to counter this. However, if the opponent is aware of this tendency, they might deliberately avoid rock. Let's consider the expected value:\n- If we play paper: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs paper (0)\n- The safest strategy with no information is still random selection\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the statistical expert. While the behavioral insight is valuable, without knowing our opponent's sophistication level, we should avoid being too predictable. I recommend making a move that appears random.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Agreed. Let's make our move while maintaining unpredictability for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper This move gives us a balanced position: it beats the common opening move of rock while maintaining unpredictability for future rounds.\n"

Now we need to consider if our opponent will adjust their strategy based on their loss.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After losing a round, players often exhibit one of two common behaviors:\n1. They might switch to what beat them (paper in this case)\n2. They might stick to their previous move hoping we'll think they'll switch\n\nStatistical Expert: Let's analyze the situation:\n- Our opponent played rock and lost\n- They know we played paper\n- Most players don't like to lose twice in a row with the same move\n- There's a higher probability they'll switch their move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, if they switch from rock, they're more likely to choose scissors to beat our previous paper move. They might assume we'll play paper again since it worked for us.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree. The psychological pressure of losing often leads to a counter-strategy against the winning move. The opponent is likely expecting us to be overconfident and repeat our winning move.\n\nStatistical Expert: Based on these factors, we should consider playing rock to:\n1. Counter the likely scissors play\n2. Protect against a predictable pattern in our own moves\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Given our opponent's likely adjustment after losing with rock, we anticipate they might switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play.

This usually prompts players to try to become less predictable. However, the stress of two losses might make them overthink their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Under pressure of two losses, many players revert to their \"strongest\" move (often rock) or try to \"double-guess\" what we're doing. Given we just won with rock, they might expect us to stick with it due to its success.\n\nStatistical Expert: To maintain our unpredictability while accounting for these factors, we should avoid being predictable ourselves.

Their pattern has become clear: they've played rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock, showing a tendency to return to rock as a \"safe\" move when under pressure.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: The psychological state of our opponent is crucial now:\n1. They've lost three times, creating significant frustration\n2. They've been caught using rock twice, both times losing to paper\n3. They're likely feeling very predictable and exposed\n4.

The opponent has their first win, which will boost their confidence\n2. They successfully broke their own pattern and our winning streak\n3.
