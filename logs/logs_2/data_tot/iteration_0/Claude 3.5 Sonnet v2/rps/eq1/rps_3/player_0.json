    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player and this is the first round, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move has an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Without prior moves to analyze, we can't predict any patterns in the opponent's behavior. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that each move has equal potential for winning or losing against one other move, the risk level is balanced. However, if we consider the psychological aspect mentioned by the Pattern Analyst, we might want to counter the common \"rock\" opening.\n\nGame Strategist: In that case, paper would be a strategic choice. If they play rock (common opening), we win. If they play scissors, we lose. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nPattern Analyst: I support this reasoning. Paper also has the psychological advantage of being perceived as a \"softer\" move, which might make our opponent underestimate our strategy.\n\nRisk Assessor: The downside risk is manageable. Even in the worst case of facing scissors, we only lose 1 point, and we have the advantage of gaining insight into our opponent's playing style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let's continue with our personas' collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting development - we lost the first round as our opponent played scissors against our paper. This gives us valuable information about their playing style.\n\nPattern Analyst: Two possibilities emerge here:\n1. The opponent might stick with scissors since it worked\n2. They might anticipate us changing our move and adjust accordingly\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent showed they're willing to be aggressive with scissors in the opening. This could indicate a bold playing style.\n\nGame Strategist: Classic game theory suggests that players often shift their moves after a win. They might think we'll play rock to counter their previous scissors, so they might switch to paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, some players do stick with winning moves until they lose. We need to consider both possibilities. If they stick with scissors, we should play rock. If they switch to paper, rock would lose.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that the opponent made an aggressive opening with scissors and won, playing rock provides the best risk-reward ratio:\n- If they stick with scissors \u2192 we win\n- If they switch to paper \u2192 we lose\n- If they switch to scissors \u2192 we tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock. It counters their previous move, and even if they anticipate this and switch to paper, we'll have gained valuable information about their strategic thinking for future rounds.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological element also supports this - players who start with scissors often expect their opponents to play rock next, so they might switch to paper. However, this very anticipation might make them overthink and stick with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "Let's continue our collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: This is getting interesting. Our opponent has shown different moves in each round: scissors, then rock. The tie gives us a neutral position to work from.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's analyze their pattern:\nRound 1: They played scissors (won)\nRound 2: They switched to rock (tied)\nThis suggests they're not sticking to winning moves and are willing to change strategies. They haven't used paper yet, which might indicate it's coming.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has demonstrated tactical flexibility. They've used an aggressive opener (scissors) followed by a conservative move (rock). This variety makes them less predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, after a tie, players often try to break the deadlock by changing their move. Since they haven't used paper yet, there's a higher probability they might use it now.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at the sequence scissors \u2192 rock, it shows a counter-clockwise movement in the traditional rock-paper-scissors cycle. If they continue this pattern, paper would indeed be their next logical move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given this analysis:\n- If they play paper (as pattern suggests) \u2192 scissors would win\n- If they stick with rock \u2192 paper would win\n- If they surprise with scissors \u2192 rock would win\n\nGame Strategist: The strongest move here is scissors. It counters the pattern-predicted paper, and even if we're wrong, losing one round is acceptable for gaining more information about their strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The psychological aspect also suggests they might play paper to try to beat our previous rock move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This repetition worked well for them, winning against our scissors.\n\nRisk Assessor: Our current score is -2 points. We need to be more effective in our predictions. The opponent has shown:\n- Confidence in using rock\n- Ability to stick with a working move\n- No use of paper yet\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might be employing a \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" strategy with rock. However, they must also realize that continuing with rock becomes increasingly risky.\n\nPattern Analyst: There are two strong possibilities:\n1. They continue with rock, believing we might overthink and not play paper\n2. They finally switch to paper, expecting us to play rock to counter their previous success\n\nRisk Assessor: Given their demonstrated strategic thinking, I believe they're likely to switch moves now. Three rocks in a row would be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I propose we play paper for these reasons:\n- If they stick with rock \u2192 we win\n- If they switch to scissors \u2192 we lose but gain valuable pattern info\n- If they switch to paper \u2192 we tie and maintain position\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

They've used scissors twice (rounds 1 and 4), and rock twice (rounds 2 and 3), but still no paper. They also seem to switch between aggressive (scissors) and defensive (rock) moves effectively.\n\nRisk Assessor: Our biggest problem has been that we're consistently one step behind. We need to stop reacting to their previous move and start anticipating their next one.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\nThey've shown they can:\n1. Switch strategies suddenly\n2. Stick with successful moves\n3. Return to previously successful moves\n\nPattern Analyst: The fact that they returned to scissors in round 4 is significant. This shows they're not afraid to reuse successful moves from earlier rounds. However, they might expect us to play rock to counter their scissors now.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that they've never used paper and have shown a preference for more aggressive moves (scissors) or stable moves (rock), they might continue this pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I propose we play rock for these reasons:\n- It counters their most recent move (scissors)\n- They've shown a tendency to alternate between rock and scissors\n- Even if they finally use paper, the information gained would be valuable\n- We need to break our losing streak, and rock is the most stable option\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

Our attempts at pattern recognition have been ineffective\n\nGame Strategist: Given their mastery of the game, we need to try something different. Traditional pattern analysis isn't working because they're operating at a higher strategic level.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence suggests they might be using a meta-strategy - not just responding to our moves, but anticipating our analytical process itself. They've shown they can:\n1. Create apparent patterns to mislead\n2. Break patterns at crucial moments\n3. Use our pattern-seeking against us\n\nRisk Assessor: Since conventional strategy isn't working, I suggest we try the most basic approach: scissors. Here's why:\n- We haven't used scissors in response to their paper yet\n- They might expect us to overthink after so many losses\n- Sometimes the simplest move is the hardest to predict\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with scissors. In game theory, when facing a superior opponent who can predict complex strategies, sometimes the best approach is to make the fundamental, obvious play.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological element supports this.

The opponent has demonstrated complete strategic dominance.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence has become almost irrelevant to analyze because they're clearly operating at a meta-level where they're not just playing moves, but playing against our entire decision-making process.\n\nRisk Assessor: We need to acknowledge some hard truths:\n1. We've lost 8 rounds and tied 1\n2. Every strategic approach we've tried has failed\n3. They seem to be able to predict not just our moves, but our thinking process\n4. Traditional game theory analysis isn't working\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when facing an opponent who has completely dominated the game, there's a concept of \"strategic reset\" - making a move not based on patterns or predictions, but on pure randomization.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Our attempts to outthink this opponent have consistently failed. They're either using an advanced algorithm or have an incredible ability to predict our decision-making process.\n\nRisk Assessor: At this point, our best option might be to simply choose randomly among the three options. Any attempt at strategy can be predicted and countered.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's use a random selection:\n- Rock: has given us our only non-loss (tie)\n- Paper: has consistently been countered\n- Scissors: has just been countered\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we're going random, I'll use the time stamp of our conversation (looking at the last digit) to select: if remainder divided by 3 is 0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this random selection method, let's play paper. At least this way, our move is truly unpredictable, even to us.\n\nRisk Assessor: Agreed. When all strategic approaches have failed, randomization might be our best option to at least avoid being predictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Counter both strategic and random decisions\n3. Maintain strategic superiority over multiple rounds\n4. Adapt to any approach we try\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when facing an opponent who has demonstrated complete dominance, sometimes the best strategy is to make the most unexpected move - which in this case might be the most obvious one.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that they just used scissors, traditional game theory would suggest rock as the counter. However, they've proven they can anticipate such straightforward reasoning.\n\nRisk Assessor: Since nothing else has worked, I propose we use rock for these reasons:\n1. It's the basic counter to their last move (scissors)\n2. It gave us our only non-loss in the game\n3. The obvious move might be unexpected after so many rounds\n4. At this point, any complex strategy is likely to be predicted\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Sometimes when all complex strategies fail, returning to fundamental gameplay is the best option. Let's play rock - not because we think we can outthink them, but because it's the basic counter to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological element supports this.

Each approach has been perfectly countered.\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, there's a concept called \"surrender to randomness\" - when an opponent has demonstrated such complete dominance that any attempt at strategy becomes counterproductive.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Let's use a truly random approach. I'll base it on the final digit of our current point total (-10):\n0 corresponds to scissors in this case.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that structured decision-making has consistently failed, this random selection removes any possibility of our reasoning being predicted.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. We'll play scissors - not based on any strategy, pattern, or counter-play, but purely as a random choice. This removes our own biases and strategic thinking from the equation.\n\nPattern Analyst: The beauty of this approach is that even we don't know why we're making this choice, which makes it theoretically impossible to predict based on our thought process.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Make a frustrated or emotional decision\n\nRisk Assessor: Paper has historically been our worst-performing move, which paradoxically might make it our best choice now - precisely because it seems like our least likely choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Yes, by choosing paper, we're:\n1.
