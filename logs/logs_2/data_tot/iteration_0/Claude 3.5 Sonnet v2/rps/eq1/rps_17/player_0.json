    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior knowledge:\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors each have a 1/3 probability of being optimal\n   - Each move beats one option and loses to another\n   - No move is inherently superior\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n   - However, anticipating this, some players choose paper first\n   - This creates a mind game of prediction and counter-prediction\n\n4. Given it's a fresh start:\n   - I shouldn't overthink it\n   - A random selection would be reasonable\n   - But I can try to exploit common human tendencies\n\n5.

Analysis of last round:\n   - I won by playing paper against rock\n   - My prediction about players often choosing rock first was correct\n   - The opponent now knows they lost to paper\n\n2. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing to paper, the opponent is likely to change their strategy\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it worked\n   - They might choose scissors to counter a potential paper play\n\n3. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'll likely play scissors\n   - To counter scissors, I should play rock\n   - This adapts to their likely adjustment\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock again, I'll lose\n   - If they play scissors as predicted, I'll win\n   - If they play paper, I'll lose\n   - The psychological factor suggests scissors is their most likely move\n\n5.
