Recent development analysis:\n   - Tie breaks my winning streak\n   - Opponent finally broke their pattern\n   - They matched my move with scissors\n   - This suggests they might be starting to read my moves\n\n3. Psychological factors after a tie:\n   - Players often:\n     a) Try to break the deadlock decisively\n     b) Might stick with the same move expecting opponent to change\n     c) Think opponent will change their move\n   - After finally \"not losing\", opponent might:\n     a) Feel more confident\n     b) Try to build on this small success\n     c) Continue their new approach\n\n4. Pattern considerations:\n   - Opponent used scissors for the second time\n   - They might be shifting strategy\n   - They might think they've finally figured out my pattern\n   - The tie might make them more aggressive\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they think they're reading my pattern:\n     * They might expect me to switch from scissors\n     * They might try to counter my next predicted move\n   - If they're feeling confident:\n     * They might stick with scissors\n     * They might try rock to beat expected scissors\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Rock would:\n     * Beat scissors if they repeat\n     * Beat scissors if they're aggressive\n     * Only lose to paper, which they're less likely to use\n   - Rock is the safest choice in this situation\n\n[move] rock\n"
