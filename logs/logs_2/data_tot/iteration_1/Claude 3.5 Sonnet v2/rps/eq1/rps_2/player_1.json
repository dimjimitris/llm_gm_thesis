    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Each choice has equal chance of winning/losing against random play\n\n3. Without any prior information about the opponent's patterns:\n   - Each option has an equal 1/3 probability of winning\n   - Each option has an equal 1/3 probability of losing\n   - Each option has an equal 1/3 probability of tying\n\n4. In this situation of complete uncertainty:\n   - There's no strategic advantage to any particular choice\n   - Best to start with a simple choice that can help establish a baseline\n\n5. Rock is often a common first move for many players because it feels \"strong\"\n   - This might make paper a good counter\n   - However, this is just speculation without data\n\n6. For this first move, I'll choose rock as a baseline move to start gathering information about the opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing last round:\n   - Both players chose rock\n   - This suggests the opponent might have similar initial strategic thinking\n   - A tie means neither player gained an advantage\n\n2.

Based on common patterns:\n   - Many players tend to switch moves after a tie\n   - They might expect me to use rock again\n   - If they expect rock, they might choose paper\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - If I play rock again: risks losing to paper, beats scissors, ties rock\n   - If I play paper: beats rock, loses to scissors, ties paper\n   - If I play scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties scissors\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game history:\n   - Last few rounds: scissors (tie) \u2192 scissors (loss) \u2192 rock (tie)\n   - Their moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've used rock twice in succession\n   - Pattern shows increasing strategic stability\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They matched my rock after their win\n   - Shows confidence in defensive play\n   - They're playing more methodically now\n   - Moving from aggressive to controlled strategy\n\n3. Psychological state after maintaining momentum:\n   - Opponent shows:\n     a) Sustained confidence from recent success\n     b) Comfort with defensive positioning\n     c) Patient, calculated decision-making\n     d) Strategic rather than emotional choices\n   - This state indicates:\n     * They're thinking clearly\n     * No longer making desperate moves\n     * Comfortable playing for ties\n\n4. After rock tie:\n   - Traditional responses:\n     * Switch to paper to beat repeated rock\n     * Stay with rock expecting opponent switch\n     * Use scissors to beat expected paper\n   - Given their recent play:\n     * They might stick with successful rock\n     * Could anticipate paper counter\n     * Might try scissors to beat expected paper\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've shown comfort with rock\n   - But they might:\n     * Expect me to use paper to beat rock\n     * Switch to scissors as counter\n     * Continue rock if they think I'll predict scissors\n   - Need to account for their improved strategy\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Given their strategic stability:\n     * They likely expect paper from me\n     * They might switch to scissors\n     * They're thinking multiple moves ahead\n   - Therefore:\n     * Rock is the optimal choice again\n     * Beats their likely scissors counter\n     * Shows I can maintain strategic patience\n     * Safe against continued rock play\n     * Takes advantage of their expectation of paper\n\n[move] rock\n"
