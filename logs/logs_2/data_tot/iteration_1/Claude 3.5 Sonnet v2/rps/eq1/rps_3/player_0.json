    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, there's no prior history to analyze. According to game theory, in rock-paper-scissors, each move should ideally be played with equal probability (1/3) to maintain unpredictability. Any predictable pattern can be exploited by the opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no data on the opponent's playing style, we can't make predictions based on patterns yet. However, studies have shown that \"rock\" is often a popular first move choice among players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that information:\n1. If opponent plays rock (common first move), paper would win\n2. If opponent plays paper (countering common rock), scissors would win\n3. If opponent plays scissors (least common first move), rock would win\n\nThe safest approach might be paper, as it beats the most common first move (rock) and at worst loses to scissors (least common).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the input. I agree that paper seems like a strategic first move, as it counters the statistically common \"rock\" opening while maintaining unpredictability.\n\n[move] paper Since statistical analysis suggests rock is a common opening move, I'll counter with paper while maintaining reasonable risk level.\n"

They also used the same strategic reasoning we did\n2. They have their own pattern or strategy\n3. It was just a coincidence\n\nPattern Analyzer: With only one data point showing our opponent chose paper, we need to consider what a strategic player might do next:\n1. They might expect us to switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper)\n2. They might switch to scissors themselves (expecting us to stay with paper)\n3. They might switch to rock (expecting us to choose scissors)\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate each possible move:\n1. Paper again - likely too predictable after a tie\n2. Scissors - obvious counter to last round's paper, might be expected\n3. Rock - could be effective if opponent switches to scissors to counter our previous paper\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, rock might be the most strategic choice. It protects against the opponent's potential scissors play (which they might choose expecting us to stick with paper), while being less obvious than switching to scissors ourselves.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis. Rock provides good strategic value here - it's not the most obvious move (which would be scissors), and it protects against the opponent's most logical counter to our previous paper move.\n\n[move] rock Since our opponent might expect us to stay with paper or switch to scissors, rock provides a strategic counter while avoiding the most predictable moves.\n"

Stay with rock, though this seems unlikely after losing to paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given these considerations, scissors would be a strong play here:\n- It beats paper if they switch to it\n- It's a logical progression from our previous paper move\n- Even if they use rock and beat us, it's a calculated risk worth taking to avoid becoming predictable\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis points strongly toward using scissors.

After finally breaking their losing streak by matching our scissors, they might either:\n1. Try to maintain the matching strategy that worked\n2. Return to conventional play with rock to beat scissors\n3. Try to predict our adaptation to the tie\n\n[move] paper While they might expect us to play rock as a conventional follow-up to scissors, paper provides protection against that obvious play while maintaining unpredictability. If they try to maintain their matching strategy from last round, they're more likely to play rock thinking we'll make that conventional choice.\n"

We need to determine if this is temporary or systematic\n3. They might continue matching to maintain their non-losing streak\n4. Or they might expect us to expect matching and break pattern\n\nAI Assistant (me): With two consecutive successful matches by the opponent, we need to consider whether they're returning to the systematic mirroring from early in the game. However, after their long losing streak, they might be using matching as a temporary safe haven before returning to conventional play.\n\n[move] rock While they might try to maintain their successful matching strategy, breaking from the obvious scissors progression after paper could catch them if they're trying to predict our adaptation to their matching behavior.
