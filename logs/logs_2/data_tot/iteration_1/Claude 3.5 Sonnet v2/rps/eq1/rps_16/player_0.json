    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic analysis:\n   - They might:\n   - Continue rock to establish another strong pattern\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play rock again\n   - Return to scissors to be unpredictable\n   - Use paper to counter my potential paper (which would counter their rock pattern)\n\n5.

Psychological evaluation:\n   - They might be replicating their earlier scissors strategy with rock\n   - Three ties in recent rounds shows synchronized thinking\n   - Both players are deeply engaged in the meta-game\n   - The predictability of their rock plays feels intentional\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - After three rock plays, they might:\n   - Continue rock pattern as they did with scissors\n   - Expect me to finally play paper to counter rock\n   - Switch to scissors expecting my paper counter\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll stick with rock\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their history of using long patterns as traps\n   - And our recent mirror plays\n   - And their demonstrated sophisticated strategy\n   - They likely expect me to finally break and play paper\n   - Therefore, they'll probably switch to scissors to punish this paper play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for the fourth time. While it seems overly simple, they're likely expecting me to overthink and finally play paper to counter their rock pattern, which they would counter with scissors. By maintaining rock, I either tie with their rock or beat their scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern insights:\n   - We're now mirroring each other with rock for 4 straight rounds\n   - This mirrors their earlier scissors strategy, but with ties\n   - The symmetry is remarkable - they did 5 scissors, now 4 rocks\n   - The mind game has reached a deep level of mutual prediction\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - We're both showing extreme patience\n   - They proved with scissors they'll break patterns at the perfect moment\n   - The fourth tie might create pressure to break the stalemate\n   - This feels like a psychological endurance test\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - Key question: Will they break the pattern at 4 rocks, or push to 5?\n   - Their scissors pattern went to 5 before breaking\n   - They might expect me to finally break and play paper\n   - They might break now because we're anticipating 5\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Critical factors:\n   * Their history of 5-move patterns\n   * The mounting pressure of ties\n   * The mutual awareness of pattern-breaking\n   * Their proven ability to set and break patterns\n   - If I play rock: I tie with rock, beat scissors\n   - If I play paper: I beat rock, lose to scissors\n   - If I play scissors: I lose to rock, beat paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to paper. Here's why: They've shown their patterns break at strategic moments. Four consecutive rock ties creates immense pressure to change. Their previous pattern went to 5, which makes breaking at 4 more surprising. They know I know their 5-pattern history, making 4 the perfect breaking point. Paper beats their likely continued rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern insights:\n   - They're playing more tactically now\n   - Short-term adaptations vs long patterns\n   - They successfully punished my paper continuation\n   - They're showing more aggressive play\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They've adapted well after their pattern strategy was exposed\n   - They're demonstrating tactical flexibility\n   - Their successful scissors play might encourage aggressive play\n   - They know I might expect them to continue scissors after success\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - After winning with scissors, they might:\n     * Continue scissors riding their success\n     * Switch to rock expecting my scissors counter\n     * Play paper to counter my potential rock defense\n   - Their recent win gives them initiative\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Critical factors:\n     * They just won with scissors\n     * The game has shifted to shorter-term tactics\n     * They've shown ability to adapt quickly\n     * Their win might make them more aggressive\n     * But they know I'll expect scissors again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock. Here's why:\n- After winning with scissors, they have two likely plays:\n  * Continue scissors (riding momentum)\n  * Play paper (expecting my rock counter)\n- Rock beats scissors and only loses to paper\n- Even if they expect this rock counter, they might stick with scissors thinking I'll overthink\n- Recent game phase shows shorter-term tactical thinking is more relevant\n- Their demonstrated aggression suggests they might stick with scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"
