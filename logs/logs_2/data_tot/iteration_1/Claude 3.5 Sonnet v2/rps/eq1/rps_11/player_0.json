    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their behavior or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability of being chosen to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without any historical data, we cannot make predictions based on patterns. However, some players tend to choose rock as their first move more frequently than other options, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate each option:\n- Rock: Safe option but loses to paper\n- Paper: Counters the common \"rock first\" tendency but loses to scissors\n- Scissors: Less common first move, loses to rock\n\nGame Strategist: While the \"rock first\" tendency is interesting, we shouldn't over-rely on this assumption. I suggest we make a balanced choice that doesn't telegraph any particular strategy for future rounds.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given the equal payoff structure (\u00b11 point) and no prior information, I agree with making a choice that maintains maximum unpredictability.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I suggest paper as our first move. It counters the potential \"rock first\" tendency while maintaining unpredictability for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Switch to what would have beaten our last move (scissors to beat our paper)\n2. Mirror our winning move (paper)\n3. Stick to their original choice if they believe we'll anticipate a change\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze each scenario:\n- If they choose scissors (most likely): rock would be our best response\n- If they mirror our paper: scissors would win\n- If they stick to rock: paper would win again\n\nPattern Analyzer: The most logical response from a competitive player would be scissors to counter our previous paper. Players tend to adapt by choosing what would have beaten the opponent's last successful move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has likely learned from the first round and will try to counter our paper play. Using rock would protect against the most probable scissors play while only risking a loss against paper.\n\nRisk Assessor: The risk/reward analysis favors rock here. It:\n- Beats the most likely scissors response\n- Ties against another rock (if they're stubborn)\n- Only loses to paper (least likely as they just lost to it)\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Could be establishing a pattern to break it later\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze what we know:\nRound 1: They played rock, lost to our paper\nRound 2: They played paper, beat our rock\nTheir pattern so far suggests possible progression: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors?\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they're following a simple rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they'll play scissors next. However, if they're truly strategic, they might anticipate us thinking this and maintain paper to beat our likely rock response.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a key decision point.

When players get a tie, there's a psychological tendency to either:\na) Stick with the same move hoping to outsmart the opponent\nb) Switch to the move that would beat their previous move (rock to beat scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown systematic thinking in their previous moves, I believe they're more likely to follow a logical progression rather than emotional response to the tie.\n\nRisk Assessor: I recommend paper for this round.

Initially followed rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors rotation\n2. Then returned to rock, suggesting they might restart the rotation\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. After losing twice with rock against paper, they're likely to:\n1. Finally abandon rock as an opening move\n2. Try to break out of predictable patterns\n3. Potentially mirror our successful paper strategy\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze their probable moves:\n- Paper: High probability as it follows their original rotation and beats their previous losing move\n- Scissors: Medium probability as it would beat our successful paper play\n- Rock: Low probability as it's lost twice to our paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological impact of losing twice with the same move (rock) against the same counter (paper) is significant. Players rarely make the same losing move three times, especially against the same counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I believe they'll either play paper (following rotation) or scissors (trying to counter our paper). Given their demonstrated strategic thinking earlier in the game, scissors seems more likely as it breaks both their rotation pattern and counters our winning move.\n\nRisk Assessor: I recommend rock for this round:\n- Beats scissors (their most likely strategic choice)\n- Loses to paper (their second most likely choice based on rotation)\n- This is a calculated risk worth taking given their probable adaptation\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their commitment to the rotation pattern has been strong, and they've actually benefited from our attempts to outthink them. Sometimes the simplest prediction is the correct one.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's play rock.

An automated player\n3. A trap to make us overconfident in our pattern recognition\n\nRisk Assessor: Following their established pattern:\n- Rock would be next in rotation (100% consistent so far)\n- Breaking pattern now would be their first deviation\n- The longer a pattern holds, the more likely it might break\n\nPattern Analyzer: The probability of them maintaining this perfect rotation for 6 rounds without any deviation is quite low for a human player. This level of consistency strongly suggests we should expect rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: However, this might be the perfect time for them to break the pattern, precisely because it's so well established.
