    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of historical data, I should consider common human behaviors:\n   - Rock is often a popular first move choice for many players\n   - Some players try to be strategic by avoiding rock on first moves\n\n4. Given this is a fresh start:\n   - I want to avoid being too predictable\n   - I want to counter potential first-move tendencies\n   - Paper would beat the common \"rock\" first move\n\n5.

Considering opponent psychology after a loss:\n   - Players often change their strategy after losing\n   - They might anticipate me repeating my winning move (paper)\n   - They might try to counter paper with scissors\n\n3. Looking at possible moves:\n   - If I play paper again: Risk of losing to scissors\n   - If I play rock: Would beat scissors if they try to counter my previous paper\n   - If I play scissors: Would lose to rock if they stick to their previous move\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Opponent lost with rock, making it less likely they'll use it again\n   - They likely expect me to stick with paper since it worked\n   - The safest counter to their most likely move (scissors) would be rock\n\n5.

Analyzing opponent behavior:\n   - They started with rock (lost)\n   - They stuck with rock in second round (tied)\n   - This suggests they might be somewhat predictable or stubborn in their choices\n   - However, after two rocks, they might feel compelled to change\n\n3.

Current reality:\n   - Lost 8 rounds\n   - Won 2 rounds\n   - 1 tie\n   - Every single approach has failed\n   - This is beyond bad luck or poor strategy\n\n2. Meta-analysis:\n   - My opponent might be:\n     a) Reading my detailed step-by-step reasoning\n     b) Using my structured thinking against me\n     c) Exploiting my attempts at logic\n   - Even when I try to be random, my process is visible\n\n3. Fundamental realization:\n   - The more I explain my thinking\n   - The more predictable I become\n   - My step-by-step reasoning is a roadmap for my opponent\n   - They might be using simpler, more effective strategy\n\n4. Complete strategy shift:\n   - No more complex analysis\n   - No more pattern seeking\n   - No more psychology\n   - No more game theory\n   - Just pure instinct\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Will play rock\n   - No further explanation or justification\n   - Pure gut choice\n\n[move] rock\n"
