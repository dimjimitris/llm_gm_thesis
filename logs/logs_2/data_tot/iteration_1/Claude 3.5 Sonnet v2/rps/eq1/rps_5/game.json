Analyzing opponent behavior:\n   - They started with rock (lost)\n   - They stuck with rock in second round (tied)\n   - This suggests they might be somewhat predictable or stubborn in their choices\n   - However, after two rocks, they might feel compelled to change\n\n3.

Key insights:\n   * I'm on a 2-round winning streak\n   * Opponent seems to be alternating between paper and rock\n   * They've still never played scissors\n   * Their moves have become somewhat predictable\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * After two losses, they're likely to:\n      * Break their pattern significantly\n      * Finally try scissors, their unused move\n      * Be more aggressive to stop their losing streak\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   * If they continue their paper/rock alternation, they'd play paper\n   * But this seems unlikely given their losing streak\n   * They know I've successfully predicted their last two moves\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Given their likely frustration after two losses\n   * And their never having used scissors\n   * They're highly likely to finally play scissors\n   * Therefore, I should play rock to counter their probable scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"
