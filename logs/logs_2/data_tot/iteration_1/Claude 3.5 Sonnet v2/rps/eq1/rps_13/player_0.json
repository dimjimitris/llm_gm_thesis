    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying any patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Psychological Expert - For understanding human behavior in games\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychological Expert: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their behavior or patterns. In such cases, humans often tend to choose 'rock' as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: From a game theory perspective, with no prior information, each move should have an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal. However, the psychological insight about 'rock' being a common first move is valuable.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could either:\n1. Play paper to counter the likely rock\n2. Play randomly to maintain unpredictability\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we have no historical data to analyze yet, I agree with using the psychological insight for this first move.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with paper as it gives us an advantage if they indeed play rock, and if they play scissors or paper, our loss or tie isn't any worse than random choice.\n\nAll personas agree on the strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and players often start with rock, paper gives us a strategic advantage.\n"

They might also be using similar strategic thinking\n2. They might change their move now since the first round was a tie\n\nPsychological Expert: After a tie, players often tend to either:\n- Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n- Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move (scissors in this case)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by also choosing paper in round 1, we should assume they're not playing randomly. The psychological tendency to switch after a tie means they're more likely to play scissors to beat our previous paper.\n\nRisk Manager: If we believe they're likely to play scissors, we should counter with rock. However, we should also consider that they might be thinking through this same logic.\n\nGame Strategist: The \"one level deeper\" thinking suggests they might anticipate us switching to rock and thus play paper. However, going too many levels deep in this reasoning can be counterproductive. Let's stay at one level of strategic depth.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one round of history, over-analyzing might lead to paralysis by analysis. Let's focus on the most likely scenario based on psychological patterns.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The safest play based on our analysis is rock, as it counters the most likely move (scissors) from our opponent.\n\nAll personas agree on the strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors after the tie, as players often try to beat their opponent's previous move.\n"

Often resort to using 'rock' as it feels like a \"strong\" move to break a losing pattern\n\nGame Strategist: Their behavior shows they might be tilting (making emotional rather than strategic decisions).
