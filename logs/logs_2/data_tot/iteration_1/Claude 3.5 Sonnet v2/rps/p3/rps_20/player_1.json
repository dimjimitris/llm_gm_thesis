    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives lower reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors beating paper gives lower reward (1 point)\n   - Matching moves results in 0 points\n4. Since paper has potential for highest reward and scissors is most dangerous against it:\n   - Playing rock would be safer as it beats scissors\n   - But paper could give higher reward if opponent plays rock\n5. For first move with no information, I'll choose rock as a balanced option:\n   - Protects against scissors\n   - Only vulnerable to paper\n   - Can win against scissors for 1 point\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They returned to rock after their paper success\n   - Paper vs rock situations continue to create big swings\n   - They've lost twice recently with rock\n   - The game has become highly dynamic again\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - They just lost with rock again\n   - They might be frustrated with predictable rock plays\n   - They likely expect me to use paper again after success\n   - They need to break my ability to predict them\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\n   - If they expect paper and play scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they play paper to mirror success: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they stick with rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - Most dangerous would be playing paper again\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given their recent losses with rock\n   - And their need to counter my successful paper plays\n   - They're most likely to play scissors to punish expected paper\n   - Therefore, I'll play rock to catch their likely scissors counter\n   - This also protects against the most dangerous outcome\n\n[move] rock\n"
