    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward ratios of different moves\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Paper vs Rock: Best reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Medium reward (+1)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Medium reward (+1)\n- Same moves: No points (0)\n- Losing moves: Corresponding negative points\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, studies show that rock is often a common first move for many players, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) while having a moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors). Rock and scissors both have lower reward potential (+1) with higher risk (-3 for rock vs paper, -1 for scissors vs rock).\n\nAI Assistant: Considering all inputs, I think paper is the optimal first move. It has the highest potential payoff (+3), and even if we lose, the penalty (-1) is less severe than losing with rock (-3).\n\n[move] paper Given the payoff structure and lack of historical data, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move.\n"

They also analyzed the risk-reward ratio similarly\n2. They might expect us to stick with paper since it was a tie\n3. They might switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again\n\nPattern Analyzer: With one round of data, we can observe that our opponent is likely a strategic player since they chose paper as their first move, similar to our reasoning. Strategic players often try to anticipate and counter their opponent's next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that the opponent appears strategic:\n- Playing paper again is risky as they might expect it\n- Scissors could be good as they might stick to paper\n- Rock would be very risky as they might anticipate our switch to scissors and play paper\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Since our opponent appears to be thinking strategically, they're likely to either:\n1. Switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again, or\n2. Keep paper expecting us to switch to rock\n\nTherefore, I believe rock would be too risky. Between paper and scissors, scissors has the better risk-reward ratio in this situation as it would win against paper (+1) and tie against scissors (0).\n\n[move] scissors Based on the previous round and opponent analysis, scissors provides a good counter to potential paper repetition while protecting against opponent's scissors.\n"

They might expect us to play paper to counter their previous rock move. However, this could be exactly what they're waiting for. Given their demonstrated ability to predict our moves, I think they'll expect us to play paper and will plan accordingly.\n\nThe safest play here, considering both the potential for gain and limited downside, is rock. If they play scissors expecting our paper, we win. If they play paper expecting our rock, we lose but we've seen they're capable of this level of thinking. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's sophisticated play pattern and risk management, rock provides a balanced option while protecting against scissors.\n"

They likely expect us to predict their next move would be scissors (following their cycle), so they might play rock to counter that prediction. However, that's also predictable.\n\nGiven their demonstrated strategic depth and their need to recover points, I believe they're most likely to play paper, which offers the highest potential reward (+3).

We might stick with rock after two successful uses\n2. They need to recover from their loss\n3. They might go for paper to punish our potential rock\n4. Or they might expect us to switch to paper and play scissors\n\nAI Assistant: The situation is delicate. We're ahead and the opponent needs to recover. After losing with scissors, they're likely to:\n1. Play paper to counter our successful rock streak\n2. Expect us to switch to paper thinking they'll play rock\n3. Want to recover points with a high-reward play\n\nGiven this analysis and our leading position, we should avoid being predictable with rock despite its recent success. The opponent is most likely to play paper here - it counters our recent rock success and offers them the highest potential reward to recover. Therefore, scissors is our best play.\n\n[move] scissors After our successful rock streak, the opponent likely expects us to continue with rock or switch to paper. Scissors provides a strong counter to their likely paper play while protecting our lead.\n"

In such situations, players often:\n1. Make aggressive plays trying to recover quickly\n2. Go for the highest possible reward\n3. Or become extremely unpredictable\n\nGiven they need to recover points quickly, they're most likely to play paper for its +3 point potential.

They need to abandon their scissors strategy\n2. They must make big plays to recover 6 points\n3. They might expect us to continue with rock after success\n4. Could be setting up for a last-ditch effort\n\nAI Assistant: This is likely approaching end-game territory. After losing with scissors again and falling further behind, the opponent is in a critical position:\n- Down 6 points\n- Recent scissors plays have failed\n- Time pressure increasing\n- Need for high-reward plays\n\nIn such a desperate position, they're most likely to:\n1. Play paper because:\n   - It offers the highest reward (+3)\n   - Counters our successful rock\n   - They need big points quickly\n2. However, this is exactly what we might expect from a desperate player\n\nGiven their pattern of scissors play and their desperate need for points, I believe they'll actually stick with paper here despite it being obvious - they simply can't afford to make small plays anymore.\n\n[move] scissors While they might try to trap us with rock, their desperate position and need for points makes paper their most likely play. They can't afford to play it safe anymore.\n"

They've successfully broken their scissors pattern\n2. Might try to build on their success with rock\n3. Could switch to paper expecting our rock counter\n4.

After their successful rock play:\n1. They might stick with rock after success\n2. They could expect us to play paper to counter their rock\n3. They might return to scissors to counter our expected paper\n\nGiven their position:\n- They still need to make up 5 points\n- They've just had success with rock\n- They showed they can break patterns effectively\n- They need to maintain momentum\n\nI believe they won't stick with rock after showing it - that's too obvious. They also won't return to scissors after using it as bait. Their most logical play is paper because:\n1. It beats rock if we try to counter their previous rock\n2. It gives them the high points they still need\n3. It's the least expected after their rock success\n\n[move] rock While they might expect this as a counter to their previous rock, rock protects against potential scissors while avoiding the trap of an obvious paper counter to their previous rock success.\n"

They've lost twice recently with scissors\n2. Need to make up 6 points quickly\n3. Might expect us to continue with successful rock\n4. Could be setting up one final strategic trap\n\nAI Assistant: At this critical late-game moment, with a 6-point deficit, the opponent is in an extremely difficult position:\n1. They need big gains quickly\n2. Recent scissors plays have failed\n3. We've shown ability to predict their moves\n4. Time is likely running short\n\nGiven this situation, they are most likely to play paper because:\n- It's their only path to a significant point gain (+3)\n- It counters our successful rock plays\n- They simply can't afford small plays anymore\n- They're forced to take risks\n\nHowever, this obvious desperation play might be exactly what they want us to think. With their recent scissors-rock-scissors pattern, they might expect us to overthink and:\n1. Assume they'll play paper out of desperation\n2. Expect us to counter with scissors\n3. Therefore play rock to beat our scissors\n\n[move] paper Despite the risk of falling for a trap, paper is our best play here. If they play rock expecting our scissors counter to their desperate paper play, we win big. If they do play desperate paper, we tie rather than lose.

Down 9 points at the very end\n2. Lost twice with scissors\n3. Has shown desperation\n4. Time must be nearly gone\n\nAI Assistant: This must be one of the very last moves of the game. The situation is now extreme:\n- Opponent is down 9 points\n- They've lost their last two rounds\n- They've shown desperation with repeated scissors\n- They have no realistic path to victory\n\nIn their absolute final desperation, they must play paper because:\n1. It's mathematically their only chance\n2. They need multiple +3 wins\n3. Time is essentially gone\n4. They can't afford to play anything else\n\nHowever, even in this desperate position, they might:\n- Try one final mind game\n- Expect us to predict their obvious paper necessity\n- Play rock to catch our scissors counter\n\n[move] rock Given our dominant position and their recent scissors plays:\n- Beats scissors if they try it a third time\n- Only loses 3 to paper while maintaining a large lead\n- Has been very successful for us lately\n- Conservative play protects our nearly insurmountable lead\n"
