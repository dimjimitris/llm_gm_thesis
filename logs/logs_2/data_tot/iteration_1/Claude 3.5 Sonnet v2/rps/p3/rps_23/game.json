Given this is the first move:\n   - There's no established pattern to base decisions on\n   - The opponent might choose rock as it's a common first move\n   - Paper would be advantageous if they choose rock (3 points)\n   - If they choose scissors, I'd lose only 1 point\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Considering risk vs reward:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3 points)\n   - With paper, worst case loss is -1 points\n   - This creates a favorable risk-reward ratio\n\n5.

Likely opponent adaptations:\n   - They might choose scissors to counter my previous paper play\n   - Less likely to choose rock again after a big loss\n   - Could choose paper to force a tie\n\n4.
