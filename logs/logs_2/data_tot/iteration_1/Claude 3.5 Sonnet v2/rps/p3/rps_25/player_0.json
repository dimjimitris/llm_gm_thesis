    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows that paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, losing with paper also means the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\nGiven this is the first move and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I'll go with rock as it's a balanced choice - it can win big against scissors (1 point) and while it can lose big to paper (-3 points), rock is often a common intuitive first choice for many players.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They might stick with rock again since it didn't lose\n3.

However, more broadly, they've shown they:\n1. Often break patterns when they become apparent\n2. Think multiple levels ahead\n3. Are good at anticipating pattern-based plays\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll play scissors.
