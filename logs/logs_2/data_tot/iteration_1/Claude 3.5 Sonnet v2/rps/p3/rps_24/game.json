You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Their scissors (lost to rock)\n\nThe alternating pattern continues perfectly - they're now on a 5-game losing streak and just lost with scissors. Following their established pattern:\n- After losing with scissors, they switch to paper\n- After losing with paper, they return to scissors\n\nThis pattern has been consistent in the last four moves, and they've become quite predictable. Based on this clear pattern and the fact they just lost with scissors, I'll choose scissors:\n- Beats paper if they follow their established pattern (+1)\n- Ties with scissors if they break pattern (0)\n- Loses minimally to rock (-1)\n\n[move] scissors Expecting them to follow pattern and use paper after scissors loss\n"

After eight consecutive scissors moves, they switched to rock, resulting in a tie. This is a significant change in their strategy. When they've made strategic changes in the past:\n1. They sometimes stick with the new move\n2. But more often revert to scissors\n3. They rarely make two strategic changes in a row\n\nGiven their historical preference for scissors and their tendency to revert to it after trying other moves (as seen in earlier rounds), I'll choose rock:\n- Beats scissors if they revert to their preferred move (+1)\n- Ties with rock if they stick with their new choice (0)\n- Loses to paper if they make another strategy change (-3)\n\n[move] rock Expecting a reversion to their preferred scissors move\n",
