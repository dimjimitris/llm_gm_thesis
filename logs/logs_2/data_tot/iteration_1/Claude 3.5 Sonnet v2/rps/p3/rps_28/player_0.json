    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors, while losing to paper costs 3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any behavioral patterns to analyze. However, rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"strong\" and \"safe.\"\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the expected values:\n- If opponent plays randomly: all moves have same expected value\n- If opponent favors rock (as Psychology Expert suggests): paper would be optimal\n- Paper has highest risk-reward ratio with +3/-1 potential outcomes\n\nGame Strategist: Given this is the first move and we have no prior information, I suggest going with paper. It has the highest potential reward, and if our Psychology Expert is right about first-move rock tendency, it's even more favorable.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with paper. Even if we're wrong, we only risk losing 1 point to scissors, while we could gain 3 points against rock.\n\nData Analyst: Concurring with paper. The risk-reward ratio is favorable, and it counters the psychologically likely rock opening.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the high reward potential and psychology of first moves\n"

A sophisticated player who anticipated our paper strategy\n2. A player who naturally favors aggressive moves\n3. Pure random choice\n\nGame Strategist: After losing with paper, we need to consider that the opponent might:\n1. Stick with their successful scissors strategy\n2. Expect us to switch to rock and thus change to paper\n3. Randomly choose again\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze what we know:\n- Opponent made an aggressive first move with scissors\n- They countered our paper successfully\n- If they stick with scissors, rock would be optimal (+1 point)\n- If they switch to paper expecting our rock, scissors would be optimal (+1 point)\n- Rock has the safest risk profile here as it beats scissors (+1) and only loses to paper (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Given the uncertainty, I would avoid paper this round as it has the highest penalty risk. Between rock and scissors, rock seems safer as it:\n1. Counters their previous move if they repeat it\n2. Has equal outcome with rock if they play it\n3. Only risks losing to paper\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock. Players often repeat successful moves, and scissors was successful for them. Even if they don't, rock is a solid defensive play after losing a round.\n\nData Analyst: The expected value calculation supports rock as the most balanced choice given our current information and the opponent's demonstrated willingness to play scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on defensive strategy and counter to previous scissors play\n"

This could mean:\n1. They're playing a very simple strategy of always choosing scissors\n2. They're trying to establish a pattern to break it later\n3. They're not strategizing much at all\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider the psychological impact of their loss in the last round:\n1. They might finally switch away from scissors after losing with it\n2. They might be stubborn and stick to scissors again\n3. They might expect us to play rock again and switch to paper\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, many players tend to switch their strategy. Given that they've shown commitment to scissors twice, they're more likely to switch now after losing.\n\nGame Strategist: If they switch, paper would be most likely as it beats our winning move (rock). Playing scissors ourselves would be risky as it would lose to rock if they finally make that choice. Rock would tie with rock but lose badly to paper.\n\nData Analyst: Let's look at expected values considering they're most likely to switch:\n- If they switch to paper: scissors wins (+1)\n- If they switch to rock: paper wins (+3)\n- If they stick to scissors: rock wins (+1)\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n1. Beats paper if they try to counter our previous rock\n2. Ties with scissors if they're stubborn\n3. Only loses 1 point to rock if they make that choice\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with scissors. It's psychologically sound as it protects against their most likely adaptation (switching to paper) while not risking too much.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on predicting opponent's likely switch to paper after their loss\n"

The opponent appears to be showing:\n1. Strong commitment to a single strategy\n2. Lack of adaptation despite different outcomes\n3. Possible attempt to condition us before making a surprise change\n\nGame Strategist: The situation is tricky:\n1. Three scissors plays in a row strongly suggests they might finally change\n2. However, their persistence with scissors despite different outcomes (win/lose/tie) might indicate a fixed strategy\n3. If they're finally going to switch, rock would be their safest choice\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure to change strategy is now very high after three identical moves. Even a player committed to a simple strategy would feel compelled to switch now, especially after a tie that reinforces the need for a change.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at historical data:\n- They've scored: +1, -1, 0 with scissors\n- Their commitment to scissors despite varying results suggests either a predetermined strategy or very simple decision-making\n- The probability of a fourth scissors play should be lower than previous rounds\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for these reasons:\n1. Beats scissors if they incredibly stick to it for a fourth time\n2. Ties with rock if they make the most logical switch\n3. Only loses to paper, which would be a more sophisticated play that we haven't seen evidence for\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Rock is psychologically sound here.

The opponent has shown:\n1. Extreme commitment to a single strategy\n2. Complete lack of adaptation despite negative outcomes\n3. Either a predetermined strategy or very basic decision-making\n4. No response to losing or varying outcomes\n\nGame Strategist: This is an unusual situation:\n1. The opponent has now lost twice with scissors\n2. They've failed to adapt after four rounds\n3. They're either:\n   - Following a fixed script\n   - Extremely stubborn\n   - Or about to make a dramatic change\n\nData Analyst: The probability calculations are interesting:\n- They've now scored: +1, -1, 0, -1 with scissors\n- Their expected value with scissors is negative\n- Any rational player would have switched by now\n- This suggests either non-rational play or a very long-term strategy\n\nPsychology Expert: After four identical moves and two consecutive negative outcomes, even the most committed player would feel enormous pressure to change. However, this player has defied conventional psychology so far. They might be:\n1. A bot with a fixed strategy\n2. Testing our adaptation\n3. Committed to scissors regardless of outcome\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend rock again because:\n1. If they're a bot or fixed-strategy player, they'll play scissors again\n2. If they finally switch, rock is their most likely choice (as it's the simplest counter to their losing strategy)\n3. The risk of them jumping straight to paper seems very low given their demonstrated lack of sophistication\n\nData Analyst: Agreed.

Plans multiple moves ahead\n2. Uses psychology effectively\n3. Is willing to take short-term losses for bigger gains\n4. Might be establishing multiple layers of patterns\n\nData Analyst: Analyzing possible strategies:\n- They might be alternating between trap setups and trap execution\n- They could be using a more complex pattern (like scissors-scissors-paper)\n- Their return to scissors might be trying to bait us into playing paper\n\nPsychology Expert: This is high-level psychological warfare:\n1. They know we're now aware of their sophistication\n2. They're likely expecting us to try to predict their next complex move\n3. The simplest play might actually be the most sophisticated choice\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1. It beats scissors if they're continuing their recent pattern\n2. It's a balanced response that doesn't overcommit to any particular theory\n3. If they're setting up another paper trap, it's likely too soon to execute it\n4. The -3 penalty from paper is worth risking given their demonstrated patience in setting up traps\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Rock shows we're alert but not paranoid. It's a measured response to their revealed complexity.\n\nData Analyst: The probability of them executing another paper trap this soon is lower than them either continuing scissors or switching to rock. This makes rock the highest expected value play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on balanced response to opponent's sophisticated strategy while protecting against their most recent move\n"
