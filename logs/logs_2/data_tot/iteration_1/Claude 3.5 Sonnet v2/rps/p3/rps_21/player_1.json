    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors & Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (+1)\n- Losing with Rock vs Paper: Highest penalty (-3)\n- Losing with Scissors vs Rock & Paper vs Scissors: Lower penalty (-1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no prior information about the opponent, we can't identify any patterns yet.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, paper has the best risk-reward ratio:\n- Win with paper: +3 points\n- Lose with paper: -1 point\nThe expected value is better than other moves, assuming random opponent play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper is the optimal first move since it has the highest potential gain (+3) with the lowest potential loss (-1).\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our analysis, I'll choose paper for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\nThis move offers the best risk-reward ratio with highest potential gain (+3) and lowest potential loss (-1).\n"

They might have the same strategic thinking as us about risk-reward\n2. They might change their move now to avoid another tie\n3. They might stick to paper thinking we'll change our move\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players showed similar strategic thinking in round 1, we need to consider what a rational opponent would do next. Most players tend to avoid repeating the same move after a tie.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the scenarios:\n1. If opponent switches to rock: scissors would lose (-1), paper would win (+3), rock would tie (0)\n2. If opponent switches to scissors: scissors would tie (0), paper would lose (-1), rock would win (+1)\n3. If opponent stays with paper: scissors would win (+1), paper would tie (0), rock would lose (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Since a rational opponent is likely to switch moves, and paper is a common first move, they might expect us to continue with paper and counter with scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n- Beats the likely scissors play\n- Only loses significantly to paper, which they just played and might avoid\n- Safe against an opponent trying to counter our previous paper play\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the Risk Manager's analysis.\n\n[move] rock\nThis counters the likely scissors play and protects against an opponent trying to counter our previous paper move.\n"

The opponent is thinking very similarly to us\n2. They might be mirroring our moves\n3. They're following a common pattern progression (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?)\n\nGame Strategist: The typical progression in rock-paper-scissors when players are thinking similarly often goes:\n1. Paper (safe first move)\n2. Rock (countering expected scissors)\n3. Scissors (breaking the pattern)\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate options:\n1. If opponent follows typical progression to scissors: scissors would tie (0), paper would lose (-1), rock would win (+1)\n2. If opponent stays rock: scissors would lose (-1), paper would win (+3), rock would tie (0)\n3. If opponent goes back to paper: scissors would win (+1), paper would tie (0), rock would lose (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Since we've had two ties, the opponent might try to break the pattern dramatically. Paper would be too predictable as it beats our previous rock move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The most likely opponent moves are either scissors (to break pattern) or paper (to beat our previous rock).\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I recommend scissors:\n- Beats paper if they try to counter our rock\n- Ties with scissors if they try to break pattern\n- Only loses to rock, which they might avoid as it was just played\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense.\n\n[move] scissors\nThis move breaks the pattern and counters a potential paper play while risking only a small penalty (-1) if we're wrong.\n"

They might be alternating between paper and rock\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent seems to be using a simple strategy without adapting to losses. After losing to scissors, they might:\n1. Try to counter scissors with rock\n2. Continue their paper-rock pattern (which would mean rock next)\n3. Finally adapt and play scissors themselves\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate the situation:\n1. If they play rock (most likely): scissors loses (-1), paper wins (+3), rock ties (0)\n2. If they play scissors (adaptation): scissors ties (0), paper loses (-1), rock wins (+1)\n3. If they play paper again (least likely): scissors wins (+1), paper ties (0), rock loses (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern and the loss they just experienced, rock seems their most logical move to counter our successful scissors play.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Their behavior suggests they're playing reactively rather than strategically, making rock their most probable choice.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper would be our best move here:\n- Beats the highly probable rock play (+3)\n- Only risks a small loss (-1) if they play scissors\n- Worst case is a tie if they inexplicably play paper again\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is sound.\n\n[move] paper\nThis move counters the opponent's likely rock play, offering high reward (+3) with minimal risk (-1).\n"

Switch to scissors, expecting us to try paper\n\nGame Strategist: In high-level RPS play, when an opponent has established dominance with one move (rock), they often expect the logical counter (paper) and prepare their own counter (scissors).

If they switch to paper: lose (-3), but they might expect us to play paper\n3. If they switch to scissors: win (+1)\n4. We need to stabilize our losses\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree.
