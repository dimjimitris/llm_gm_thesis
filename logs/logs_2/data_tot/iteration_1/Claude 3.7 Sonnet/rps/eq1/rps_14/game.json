My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   After their long scissors streak, they've been playing rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n3. We've now had four consecutive ties, which is extremely unusual and suggests either:\n   - We're both using similar reasoning to predict each other's moves\n   - The opponent might be mirroring my moves\n   - There could be some lag or technical issue (unlikely)\n\n4. If the opponent is mirroring my moves, then whatever I play, they'll play the same.\n\n5. Let's test the mirroring hypothesis by deliberately choosing paper. If they're mirroring, they'll also play paper.\n\n6. If they're not mirroring but following their own pattern:\n   - Their recent sequence (paper \u2192 rock) might continue with scissors\n   - Or they could repeat the rock move since it resulted in a tie\n\n7. If they play scissors, my paper would lose.\n   If they play rock again, my paper would win.\n   If they mirror with paper, we tie again.\n\n8. Given the unusual string of ties and the possibility of mirroring, I should choose the move that gives me the best outcome if they're not mirroring but following a pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors this round. If they're mirroring, we tie again. If they're following a pattern and play paper next, I win. If they play rock again, I lose, but this gives us information about their strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've now had five consecutive ties, which strongly suggests the opponent is mirroring my moves.\n\n3. The mirroring hypothesis has been reinforced by our last round - I deliberately chose scissors to test this theory, and they played scissors as well.\n\n4. If they are indeed mirroring my moves, then whatever I play in this round will result in another tie.\n\n5. However, there's a small chance this is an extraordinary coincidence and they're actually following their own strategy.\n\n6. In a true mirroring situation, no choice gives me an advantage.\n\n7. Since we've established that ties are likely, I should consider a longer-term strategy:\n   - I could send a \"message\" by playing the same move repeatedly, hoping they'll eventually break the mirroring pattern\n   - I could continue varying my moves to see if the mirroring continues\n\n8. With the information I have, I'll choose paper - it's as good a choice as any in a mirroring scenario, and if they happen to break the pattern with rock (returning to one of their earlier preferred moves), I would win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We've now had six consecutive ties, which confirms beyond reasonable doubt that the opponent is mirroring my moves.\n\n3. In a perfect mirroring situation, no strategy can give me an advantage - whatever I play will result in a tie.\n\n4. However, there may be a psychological aspect to consider. If I establish a pattern and then break it, I might be able to \"trick\" the mirroring player:\n   - If I play the same move multiple times in a row, they might anticipate I'll play it again and prepare a counter\n   - Then if I switch, I might catch them off guard\n\n5. Let me try a different approach. I'll play rock this round, with the intention of playing rock again next round, and then switching to paper in the round after that (if the mirroring continues).\n\n6. This is essentially setting up a longer-term strategy rather than trying to win this specific round, which seems impossible against a perfect mirror.\n\n7. If by chance they're not mirroring but have just happened to make the same choices as me for six rounds (extremely unlikely), then any move has an equal chance of winning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, as part of a longer-term strategy to potentially break the mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is a major development - the mirroring pattern has been broken! After six consecutive ties, my opponent played scissors when I played rock.\n\n3. This suggests either:\n   - They were never truly mirroring but we had an extraordinary coincidence for six rounds\n   - They were mirroring but decided to switch strategies\n   - They anticipated I would play rock and tried to counter with paper, but made a mistake and played scissors\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played scissors 8 times out of 14 rounds (57% of the time), showing a strong bias toward scissors.\n\n5. They might return to their scissors-heavy strategy now that the tie streak is broken.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might try to establish a new pattern or respond to what they think my next move will be.\n\n7. If they expect me to play rock again (since it just won), they might play paper.\n\n8. If they revert to their scissors-bias, I should play rock.\n\n9.

Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: rock\n   - Round 20: scissors\n\n4. They've returned to scissors, which has been their most frequent move overall (10 out of 20 rounds, or 50%).\n\n5. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their historically preferred move)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (if they think I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n\n6.

If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n\n8. Considering their overall pattern and recent success with scissors, rock seems like the strongest play.\n\n9. Additionally, rock has been my most successful move against this opponent, winning 3 times and only losing once.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, which would beat scissors if they continue with it (which seems likely given their history).\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - They've played scissors in 11 out of 21 rounds (52%)\n   - They've shown a tendency to stick with moves despite losses\n   - They occasionally make strategic switches\n\n6. My rock play has been very successful against them (won 4 times, lost once, tied twice).\n\n7. Given that I just won with rock, they're likely to anticipate I'll play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n8. If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n   If they stick with scissors, I should play rock again.\n   If they play rock, I should play paper.\n\n9. Given their strong historical preference for scissors and tendency to repeat moves, but also considering they just lost to rock twice recently, this is a challenging prediction.\n\n10.

Interestingly, they've cycled through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper in their last three moves.\n\n5. After a tie, players often:\n   - Keep the same move, thinking the opponent will switch\n   - Switch to the move that would beat their previous move\n   - Switch to counter what they think the opponent will play next\n\n6. If they continue the observed cycle (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?), their next move would be scissors.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might:\n   - Stick with paper after the tie\n   - Switch to scissors to beat my potential paper repeat\n   - Switch to rock to beat my potential scissors play\n\n8. Given their historical preference for scissors (11/23 rounds) and the potential cycle they're following, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n9. If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they stick with paper, I should play scissors.\n   If they play rock, I should play paper.\n\n10. Considering both their cyclical pattern and historical preference, rock seems like the strongest play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, which would beat scissors if they follow the cycle or return to their preferred move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's analyze the complete pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent has switched back to paper, beating my rock.\n\n3. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 24: paper\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: scissors\n   - Round 27: paper\n\n4. My opponent appears to be playing somewhat unpredictably now, switching between paper and scissors.\n\n5. Analyzing their overall choices:\n   - They've played scissors 12 times (44%)\n   - They've played paper 11 times (41%)\n   - They've played rock 4 times (15%)\n\n6. Their play has become more balanced between scissors and paper, with rock used much less frequently.\n\n7. After winning with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (they've shown a tendency to repeat successful moves)\n   - Switch to scissors (they've alternated between paper and scissors recently)\n   - Switch to rock (least likely given their low usage of rock)\n\n8. If they play paper again, I should play scissors.\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n\n9. Given their recent pattern of alternating between paper and scissors, and their win with paper, scissors seems like the strongest play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll continue with paper after their recent win with it.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played paper two times in a row (Rounds 27-28).\n\n3. I just won with scissors against their paper.\n\n4. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Round 25: paper\n   - Round 26: scissors\n   - Round 27: paper\n   - Round 28: paper\n\n5. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my scissors (the rational move)\n   - Continue with paper despite losing (they've shown this tendency before)\n   - Switch to scissors (their historically preferred move)\n\n6. Analyzing their behavior after losses:\n   - In Round 26, they switched from paper to scissors after losing\n   - In Round 27, they switched back to paper after losing\n   - They've shown inconsistent adaptation after losses\n\n7. Given that they just lost to scissors with paper, the rational move would be for them to switch to rock.\n\n8. However, they've rarely played rock (only 4 times in 28 rounds), suggesting they may be reluctant to use it.\n\n9. They might instead switch back to scissors, which has been their most frequent choice overall.\n\n10. If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n    If they stick with paper, I should play scissors again.\n    If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n\n11. Given their historical reluctance to play rock, their preference for scissors, and the fact that they just lost to scissors, rock seems like the safest choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll switch to scissors after losing to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might choose scissors.\n6. Since I have no information about my opponent's strategic depth, I should avoid being too predictable.\n7.

In a single game of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, no move has a theoretical advantage over others.\n4. Since rock-paper-scissors is balanced (each move wins against one option and loses against another), the optimal strategy is to select randomly.\n5. However, human players often have unconscious patterns or preferences. A common first move is rock, as studies have shown it's slightly more popular as an initial choice.\n6.

My opponent now knows I played paper in the first round.\n3. A common psychological pattern is for players to switch to a move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move.\n4. Since I played paper, my opponent might switch to scissors to counter what I played before.\n5. If they're thinking this way, my best response would be rock to counter their likely scissors.\n6. However, they might also anticipate this thinking and stick with rock or switch to paper.\n7. Given that they played rock in the first round, there's some chance they'll stick with it (some players have favorite moves they default to).\n8.

Common patterns after losing with rock include:\n   a) Switching to paper (to beat the expected rock)\n   b) Switching to scissors (to beat my previous winning move of paper)\n   c) Sticking with rock (some players are creatures of habit)\n4. Option b (scissors) seems most likely since players often try to counter what beat them previously.\n5. If I expect my opponent to play scissors, my optimal move would be rock.\n6. However, if they anticipate this adjustment and play paper instead, I would lose.\n7. Given that I only have one data point, I should consider that my opponent might be employing a strategy to counter my expected move.\n8. Since I played paper last time and won, my opponent most likely expects me to play paper again or switch to scissors.\n9.

Option (c) is most likely - players often counter the previous winning move.\n5. If they switch to scissors to counter my previous paper, I should play rock to counter their scissors.\n6. There's also psychology at work - they might think I'll stick with paper after winning, making scissors even more appealing to them.\n7.

Some players might also stick with their previous move, hoping I won't expect repetition.\n5. Another common strategy after losing is to play what would have beaten the opponent's previous move - in this case, scissors would have beaten my paper.\n6.

The tie in the last round confirms my opponent is indeed playing scissors repeatedly, not just when I play paper or rock.\n\n5. After a tie, players often change their move, thinking the opponent will change as well.\n\n6. Given that my opponent finally experienced something other than a loss with their scissors strategy, they might be reinforced to continue with scissors.\n\n7. However, they might also view the tie as a reason to finally switch strategies after so many scissors plays.\n\n8. If they switch from scissors, they're most likely to play rock (to beat my scissors).\n\n9. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best play.\n\n10. Given their demonstrated persistence with scissors (6 rounds in a row), there's a higher probability they'll continue with scissors than switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, which would win against their likely scissors play and tie against a potential rock play if they switch.\n\n[move] rock\n",

The last round revealed something important - my opponent finally saw me break my pattern and play scissors, resulting in a tie.\n\n4. After a tie, players often switch moves, thinking their opponent will stay with the same move.\n\n5. If my opponent follows this common psychology, they might switch to rock to beat my expected scissors repeat.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might finally break their scissors streak after seeing it resulted in a tie rather than a loss.\n\n7. Another possibility is that they'll stick with scissors out of habit or a fixed strategy.\n\n8. Given their demonstrated strong preference for scissors and our tie in the last round:\n   - If they switch to rock (to beat expected scissors), I should play paper\n   - If they switch to paper (complete change), I should play scissors\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play rock\n\n9. The probability seems highest that they'll either stick with scissors or switch to rock (to counter scissors). Between these two possibilities, paper would win against rock and lose against scissors.\n\n10. Given their overwhelming scissors bias throughout the game, I think paper is too risky. Rock would be the safer play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating either another scissors play or a switch to rock after our tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If my opponent follows this common pattern, they might expect me to play rock again and would play paper to counter it.\n\n6.

Given the recent tie with rock, I think the most probable scenarios are:\n   - They expect me to play rock again and will play paper\n   - They expect me to try to counter their rock with paper, so they'll play scissors\n   - They return to their apparent comfort move of scissors\n\n8. Of these possibilities, playing scissors carries a high risk if they play rock again, and playing rock carries a high risk if they switch to paper.\n\n9.

Since conventional strategy doesn't apply in this situation, I could:\n   - Continue with random moves, accepting the ties\n   - Play the same move consistently to signal a desire to break the pattern\n   - Try to predict when/if they might break the pattern\n\n6. Given that we're likely to tie again regardless of my choice, I'll choose rock this round.\n\n7.

After losing with paper against my scissors, a rational player would likely switch to rock to counter scissors.\n\n6. However, this opponent has previously shown a tendency to repeat moves even after losing (like their scissors streak).\n\n7. If they switch to rock (the logical counter to my scissors), I should play paper.\n   If they play paper again (continuing their recent pattern), I should play scissors again.\n   If they revert to scissors (their historical preference), I should play rock.\n\n8. Given that they've just lost with paper but have shown a tendency to repeat moves in the past, there's a reasonable chance they might play paper again. However, the rational move would be for them to switch to rock.\n\n9. Weighing these possibilities, paper seems like the safest choice - it beats rock (their most likely rational move) and only loses to scissors (which they might play but is less likely after their recent paper streak).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Looking at my opponent's most recent moves:\n   - Round 15: paper\n   - Round 16: paper (repeated)\n\n3. They've played paper twice in a row now, which is a new pattern for them.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, they have a few likely options:\n   - Switch to rock to beat my expected scissors play\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock\n\n5. A common psychological pattern is for players to switch moves after losing. If they follow this pattern, they're likely to switch away from paper.\n\n6. Given their historical preference for scissors (8 out of 16 rounds), there's a reasonable chance they'll revert to scissors.\n\n7. If they play rock, my scissors would lose.\n   If they play paper again, my scissors would win.\n   If they play scissors, my rock would win.\n\n8. Since they've lost with paper twice (once against my rock earlier, and now against my scissors), they're likely to switch. Rock seems their most probable choice to counter my scissors.\n\n9. To counter their expected rock, I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n",

My opponent has now played paper twice in a row, which is a shift from their earlier scissors-heavy strategy.\n\n3. Recent patterns:\n   - The mirroring pattern was broken in Round 14\n   - They've played paper in Rounds 15 and 16\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n\n4. After losing, players often change their strategy. Since my opponent just lost with paper, they're likely to switch to a different move.\n\n5. Common responses after losing:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten your opponent's move (rock to beat my scissors)\n   - Switch to what your opponent just played (scissors)\n   - Switch to the third option (paper again, less likely)\n\n6. The most probable response from my opponent is rock, as it beats the scissors I just played.\n\n7. If they play rock, I should play paper to win.\n\n8. There's also a chance they'll revert to their scissors-heavy strategy, especially if they're not employing sophisticated counter-strategies.\n\n9. If I play paper:\n   - It beats rock (their most likely next move)\n   - It loses to scissors (their historically most common move)\n   - It ties with paper (less likely they'll play this again after losing with it)\n\n10.

Recent developments:\n   - My opponent has played paper twice in a row now\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n   - After the mirroring phase, they've played: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. Common psychological patterns suggest:\n   - Players often change their move after losing\n   - Players sometimes repeat a move that just lost, thinking the opponent won't expect it\n   - Players rarely play the move that would have lost to their previous move\n\n4. Based on these patterns, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Switch away from paper after losing to scissors\n   - Most likely switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   - Less likely switch to scissors (which would be unusual after losing with paper)\n\n5. If they play rock, my scissors would lose.\n   If they play paper again, my scissors would win.\n   If they play scissors, my scissors would tie.\n\n6. Given their historical scissors bias (8/16 rounds), there's some chance they'll revert to scissors.\n\n7. However, their recent paper plays and the fact that they just lost suggest they're more likely to switch to rock.\n\n8.

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 14: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock again, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, they played paper again (I won)\n\n3. My opponent has now played paper twice in a row, which is unusual given their previous strong bias toward scissors.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors)\n   - Return to scissors (their most common move historically)\n   - Continue with paper (less likely given they just lost with it)\n\n5.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Three paper plays in a row (Rounds 15-17)\n   - Then scissors in Round 18\n\n3. They've broken their paper streak and switched to scissors.\n\n4. This could suggest:\n   - They're responding to my moves (playing scissors to counter my anticipated paper)\n   - They're returning to their earlier scissors-heavy strategy\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern\n\n5. After our scissors tie, common strategies suggest:\n   - They might stick with scissors (if they think I'll switch)\n   - They might switch to rock (to counter my potential repeated scissors)\n   - They might switch to paper (if they're cycling through moves)\n\n6. Given their historical bias toward scissors and the fact that they just returned to scissors after a paper streak, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n7. However, a rational player would likely switch to rock after a scissors tie, anticipating that I might play scissors again.\n\n8. If they play scissors again, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9. Weighing these possibilities and their historical tendencies, rock seems like the optimal choice - it beats scissors (their most common move historically and their most recent play) and only loses to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My opponent has broken their paper streak and switched to scissors in Round 18.\n\n3. We've now had 9 ties out of 18 rounds, which is an unusually high number and suggests they might be attempting to mirror my moves at times.\n\n4. Looking at the most recent pattern:\n   - They played paper three times (Rounds 15-17)\n   - Then switched to scissors (Round 18)\n\n5. This could indicate:\n   - They're reacting to my moves (played scissors when I did)\n   - They're returning to their earlier scissors-heavy strategy\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern\n\n6. After a tie with scissors, common strategies include:\n   - Playing scissors again (thinking opponent will switch)\n   - Switching to rock (to beat scissors if repeated)\n   - Switching to paper (to beat rock if opponent plays rock)\n\n7. If they're mirroring me again, whatever I play will result in a tie.\n\n8. If they're following their own strategy:\n   - If they play scissors again (continuing their historical preference), I should play rock\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter potential scissors), I should play paper\n   - If they switch to paper (to counter potential rock), I should play scissors\n\n9.

After our tie with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (as they've shown a tendency to stick with moves)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter scissors if they think I'll repeat)\n   - Switch to paper (breaking their pattern completely)\n\n5. Given our history of ties, there's also a possibility they're sometimes trying to mirror my moves.\n\n6. If they play scissors again, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, I should play paper.\n   If they switch to paper, I should play scissors.\n\n7. Their historical tendency has been to favor scissors (played in 9 out of 18 rounds) and to repeat moves for multiple rounds.\n\n8.

Looking at their overall pattern:\n   - They've played scissors 10 times out of 20 rounds (50%)\n   - They've played rock 5 times (25%)\n   - They've played paper 5 times (25%)\n\n4. This confirms their strong bias toward scissors throughout the game.\n\n5. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (sticking with what worked)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n\n6. Given their historical preference for scissors and their success with it in the last round, there's a significant chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n7. The optimal counter to scissors is rock, which has been my most successful move against this opponent.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this and play paper to counter my rock.\n\n9.
