I've now won 8 rounds, tied 2, and lost 1.\n4. My prediction in the last round was correct - they played paper after losing with scissors, following their \"counter the counter\" pattern.\n5. Now that they've lost with paper to my scissors, if they continue this pattern, they would play rock (to beat the scissors that beat their paper).\n6. Their overall distribution is now: rock 4 times, scissors 4 times, and paper 3 times - becoming slightly more balanced.\n7. Looking at my own pattern, I've been quite successful but may have become somewhat predictable. My last three moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is a classic rotation.\n8. If my opponent has noticed this pattern, they might expect me to play paper next and play scissors to counter.\n9. However, their strongest tendency seems to be responding to losses with the \"counter the counter\" strategy.\n10. Given their consistent behavior after losses throughout the game, rock seems most likely from them.\n11. If they play rock as predicted, paper would be my best move.\n12. If they try to anticipate my pattern and play scissors (expecting my paper), rock would be best.\n13. Since they've followed the \"counter the counter\" pattern so consistently after losses, I believe rock is their most likely next move.\n14.

Their response to losses has been 100% consistent throughout all 29 rounds without a single deviation:\n   - After losing to paper, they play scissors\n   - After losing to rock, they play paper\n   - After losing to scissors, they play rock\n\n8. This pattern has been extraordinarily reliable and has allowed me to predict their moves with perfect accuracy for many consecutive rounds.\n\n9. Given their unwavering adherence to this pattern despite consistent losses, rock is virtually certain to be their next move.\n\n10. If they play rock as predicted, paper would be my best move.\n\n11. After 29 rounds with perfect consistency in their pattern, there's no reason to expect any change in their strategy.\n\n12. Therefore, paper would be the optimal choice to counter their expected rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"
