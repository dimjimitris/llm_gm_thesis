You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Throughout the game, they've shown a tendency to repeat moves multiple times before switching. While their pattern became less predictable for a couple of rounds, they seem to be playing rock again. Given that paper beats rock with a high point gain (+3), I'll continue with paper for this round. Even if they anticipate this and play scissors, the potential loss (-1) is less than the potential gain.\n",

This might signal a return to their earlier pattern of repeating moves 2-3 times before switching. Based on this pattern, there's a good chance they'll either play rock again or switch to scissors to counter my paper. Given the higher reward for paper beating rock (+3) compared to the penalty for scissors beating paper (-1), and their historical tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds, I'll continue with paper as the strategic choice.\n",
