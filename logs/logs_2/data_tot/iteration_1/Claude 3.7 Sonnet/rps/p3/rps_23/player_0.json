Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I notice that paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins.\n4. Without any prior history, all three moves are equally likely to succeed.\n5. However, rock is a common first move for many players due to psychological reasons.\n6. Playing paper would counter this common first move and give me the highest possible reward.\n7. The risk if they play scissors is only -1, whereas the reward if they play rock is +3.\n8. This makes paper a favorable risk-reward choice for the first move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper as my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The previous round was a tie - both the other player and I played paper.\n2. Since the other player chose paper in the first round, I need to consider what they're likely to do next.\n3. Players often change their move after a tie, following a pattern of thinking about what the opponent might do.\n4. The other player might reason that I would play scissors this round to beat their previous paper.\n5. If they think I'll play scissors, they might choose rock to counter it.\n6. Alternatively, they might anticipate this whole chain of reasoning and stick with paper or switch to scissors themselves.\n7. Given the higher reward structure for paper beating rock (+3 vs. -3), there's a stronger incentive for them to play rock if they think I'll stay with paper.\n8. Looking at expected value: if I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point; if they play paper again, I gain 1 point.\n9. If I play rock and they play scissors, I gain 1 point; if they play paper again, I lose 3 points.\n10. The safest play with potential upside is scissors, as it would beat their paper if they repeat, and has the smallest potential loss (-1) if they switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After playing scissors, many players would expect their opponent to play rock next (to beat scissors).\n5. If the other player thinks I'll play rock, they might play paper to beat rock.\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll try to counter their anticipated paper with scissors.\n7. This creates a circular reasoning pattern common in rock-paper-scissors.\n8. Breaking this pattern, I should consider the payoff structure again:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - The risk of playing paper (losing to scissors) is relatively low (-1)\n9. Since we both played scissors last round, there's a psychological tendency to not repeat the same move three times.\n10.

Three consecutive ties also suggests the other player might be mirroring my moves or using similar strategic thinking.\n9. To break this cycle, I should consider a move that doesn't follow the established pattern.\n10. Since we've played paper twice and scissors once, rock has been used the least.\n11. Playing rock would break our established pattern and might catch them off guard if they're expecting scissors or another paper.\n12. The risk of playing rock is losing 3 points if they play paper, but I gain 1 point if they play scissors.\n13.

After playing rock, a common next move would be paper (as players often cycle through the options).\n4. However, if both of us are thinking this way, we'll tie again with paper.\n5. I need to break this synchronized thinking pattern.\n6. Let's analyze what might be happening:\n   - Either the other player is deliberately matching my moves\n   - Or we're coincidentally using the same strategic reasoning\n7. If they're deliberately matching me, they'll need to anticipate my move before making theirs.\n8. If we're just thinking alike, I need to introduce randomness or a different pattern.\n9. The most unexpected move after rock might be rock again, as players rarely repeat the same move.\n10. However, if they're anticipating me to break patterns, they might expect scissors (skipping paper).\n11. The highest reward potential is with paper beating rock (+3), but that's also the most obvious next move.\n12. Given our history of synchronization, I should choose the move that seems least predictable from our established pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.

Five consecutive ties indicates either incredible coincidence or the other player is somehow matching my moves exactly.\n3. At this point, I need to consider if there's something systematic happening:\n   - Is the other player somehow seeing my moves before making theirs?\n   - Is there a pattern in my reasoning that's perfectly predictable?\n   - Am I playing against another AI with similar reasoning?\n4. Regardless of the cause, I need to introduce true unpredictability.\n5. In a truly random selection, each move should have a 1/3 probability.\n6. Our sequence so far has included 2 papers, 2 scissors, and 1 rock.\n7. Rock has been played the least, which might make it less expected.\n8. However, trying to be strategic about this might lead to another tie if the other player follows the same logic.\n9. Since we've just played scissors, the natural progression would be to play rock next.\n10. But given our perfect synchronization, this would likely result in another tie.\n11. Breaking out of synchronized thinking requires a deliberately counter-intuitive choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.

After a tie, many players tend to switch moves, thinking their opponent will do the same.\n6. If they think I'll switch from rock to paper (a common progression), they might play scissors.\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper, so they might play rock again.\n8.

Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and play rock, in which case they might play paper again.\n7. The opponent seems to be alternating between following patterns and making unexpected moves.\n8. My unconventional choice of scissors after rock paid off last round.\n9. The opponent might now be expecting me to make another unconventional choice.\n10. If they expect me to be unpredictable, they might play defensively with rock (which has the lowest potential loss).\n11. Alternatively, they might try to counter my expected rock with paper.\n12. Given that they've played paper twice recently (and lost with it last time), they're unlikely to play paper a third time.\n13. The most likely move from them would be rock, either as a direct counter to my scissors or as a defensive move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round. This anticipates them playing rock to counter my previous winning scissors move, and would give me another win (with the higher +3 reward) if they do so.\n\n[move] paper\n"
