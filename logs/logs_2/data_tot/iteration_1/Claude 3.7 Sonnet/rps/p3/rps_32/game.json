Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest risk (-3).\n5. Rock and scissors both have moderate reward/risk profiles (+1/-1).\n6.

Given their strong historical bias toward scissors (70% of moves), rock still has the highest expected value.\n13. The risk of them finally changing their pattern exists, but their demonstrated behavior suggests scissors remains their most likely move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's strong historical preference for scissors (7/10 rounds) and their reluctance to change this pattern even after losses, I'll play rock again, which has proven successful against their scissors in previous rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After three losses to rock, it becomes increasingly likely that my opponent will finally adapt:\n   a) They might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper\n   b) They might still stick with scissors (though this seems increasingly irrational)\n7. The fact that they're so persistent with scissors despite multiple losses suggests either:\n   a) They have a very strong bias toward scissors regardless of outcome\n   b) They're setting up for a strategic shift, hoping I'll continue playing rock\n8. If they finally switch to paper (to beat my rock), I should play scissors.\n9. If they somehow continue with scissors, I should play rock.\n10. Given that they've lost three times with the same pattern, the probability of them adapting is now much higher.\n11. The rational move for them would be to finally switch to paper.\n12. I need to be prepared for this adaptation rather than expecting the pattern to continue indefinitely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After three consecutive wins with rock against scissors, I expect my opponent to finally adapt and play paper. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played scissors in 9 out of 12 rounds (75% of the time).\n5. This is an extraordinarily strong bias toward scissors, even after multiple losses to rock.\n6. The pattern is now clear: my opponent has a very strong preference for scissors regardless of outcome.\n7. My only wins have come from playing rock against their scissors.\n8. My losses have come from playing paper against scissors, and scissors against rock.\n9. Given their demonstrated behavior, the statistically optimal move is rock, which has consistently won against their preferred scissors.\n10. While there's always a possibility they might finally adapt, their history suggests an unusually strong commitment to playing scissors.\n11. The expected value of playing rock is significantly positive given their demonstrated tendencies.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's overwhelming preference for scissors (9/12 rounds, 75%) and my consistent success with rock against their scissors, I'll play rock again.

If they play scissors again, my best move is rock.\n11. If they play rock again (less likely based on history), my best move would be paper.\n12. If they play paper (least likely based on history), my best move would be scissors.\n13. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern, scissors remains their most likely move by far.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on my opponent's strong historical preference for scissors (13/18 rounds = 72%) and their pattern of returning to scissors after brief deviations, I'll play rock again, which has consistently been successful against their preferred scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played scissors in 14 out of 19 rounds (74%).\n5. I've won with rock against their scissors 6 times now.\n6. Their pattern of behavior is remarkably consistent: strong preference for scissors, occasional deviations, but always returning to scissors.\n7. After I win with rock against their scissors, they sometimes adapt by playing rock (round 17), but then quickly return to scissors.\n8. Given this pattern, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors (most likely based on history)\n   b) Switch to rock to counter my anticipated rock (happened once before)\n   c) Switch to paper to counter my anticipated rock (least likely based on history)\n9. If they play scissors again, my best move is rock.\n10. If they switch to rock, my best move would be paper.\n11. If they switch to paper, my best move would be scissors.\n12. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern and the fact they just lost with scissors to rock, there's a slightly increased chance they might adapt with rock.\n13. However, their overall history suggests a very strong tendency to return to scissors regardless of outcomes.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent's extremely strong preference for scissors (14/19 rounds = 74%) and the fact that I've consistently won with rock against their scissors, I'll continue with this successful strategy and play rock again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After 8 consecutive scissors plays, my opponent finally adapted and played paper against my rock.\n5. This suggests they've finally recognized the pattern and adjusted their strategy accordingly.\n6. After this successful adaptation, they might:\n   a) Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   b) Switch to rock, anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   c) Return to their preferred scissors\n7.

Between these possibilities, scissors seems to have the best expected value, as it either wins against paper or loses minimally against rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent has shown a tendency to adapt strategically in recent rounds, and just lost to my paper with their rock, I'll play scissors anticipating they might switch to paper to counter my expected rock (or continue with rock but expecting me to play paper again).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played scissors three times in a row, which is quite unusual in rock-paper-scissors.\n5. After a player loses a round, they typically change their move. My opponent just lost with scissors.\n6. Following this psychology, my opponent is likely to switch away from scissors.\n7. They may switch to:\n   a) Rock - to beat my expected scissors (if they think I'll anticipate their switch to paper)\n   b) Paper - to beat my expected rock (if they think I'll play rock again after winning with it)\n8. Since I just won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again (a common tendency is to repeat winning moves).\n9. If they expect me to play rock again, their best response would be paper.\n10. To counter that, I should play scissors.\n11. However, if they expect this level of thinking, they might play rock to beat my scissors.\n12. This becomes a mind game of anticipating levels of reasoning.\n13.

They've now played scissors in 6 out of 9 rounds (67% of the time).\n5. I've won both times I played rock against their scissors.\n6. After I win, my opponent typically changes their strategy:\n   - After I won in round 6, they switched from scissors to rock\n   - So they might switch again after losing in round 9\n7. However, they have a very strong preference for scissors, returning to it even after it loses.\n8. They might expect me to play rock again since it just worked, and counter with paper.\n9. But given their strong scissors preference, they might stubbornly stick with scissors.\n10. I need to consider the psychological aspects:\n    - They know rock just worked for me twice\n    - They know I know they favor scissors\n    - They know I might expect them to counter my rock with paper\n11. This creates multiple levels of thinking: if they expect me to play rock, they should play paper. If they expect me to anticipate this and play scissors, they should play rock.\n12. Given their demonstrated preference for scissors even when it's not working, there's a good chance they'll stick with it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite the risk that they might switch to paper, their strong historical preference for scissors (6/9 rounds) and tendency to return to scissors even after losses makes rock my best statistical play again.\n\n[move] rock\n",

However, they might also be more sophisticated and anticipate that I'll expect them to switch to rock, in which case they might play paper to beat my expected rock.\n10. If they play paper, scissors would be my best move (+1).\n11. Given their strong preference for scissors so far, there's also a chance they'll stick with scissors despite losing twice to rock.\n12. Considering the payoff structure and their behavioral patterns:\n    - If they play rock (adapting to my win): paper wins (+3)\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock): scissors wins (+1)\n    - If they play scissors again (their preference): rock wins (+1)\n13.

However, after I won with rock again in round 9, they might:\n   a) Switch to paper to counter my expected rock\n   b) Continue with scissors (their apparent preference)\n   c) Switch to rock (as they did after my previous rock win)\n8. Given that they switched strategies after losing with scissors before, option a) seems most likely - they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n9.

They must be aware that I've identified their scissors bias and am countering with rock.\n9. The most logical adaptation for them would be to play paper to beat my expected rock.\n10. If they play paper, scissors would be my best move.\n11. If they continue with scissors (which seems unlikely at this point), rock would win again.\n12. If they play rock (over-adapting), paper would be best.\n13. Given the clear pattern of my wins with rock, they are most likely to counter with paper this round.\n14. The psychological pressure to change strategy after three losses with the same move is very high.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After winning three times with rock against scissors, I expect my opponent to finally adapt and play paper. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

After three losses to rock, surely they must adapt this time.\n7. The rational move for them would be to play paper to counter my expected rock.\n8. If they play paper, my best move would be scissors.\n9. However, they've shown an extremely strong bias toward scissors, even in the face of repeated losses.\n10. This presents a dilemma:\n    - If I assume they'll finally adapt, I should play scissors\n    - If I assume they'll continue their pattern, I should play rock\n11. Given their demonstrated reluctance to change (8 scissors plays out of 11 rounds, including after multiple losses), there's still a significant chance they'll play scissors again.\n12. However, after losing three times with the same move-countermove pattern, the probability they'll adapt is now higher than before.\n13. The safest play is to assume they'll finally adapt after three consecutive losses to the same move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round, anticipating that my opponent will finally adapt after three consecutive losses and play paper to counter my successful rock strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

After three losses to the same counter-move (rock), most players would finally adapt.\n7. This creates a significant decision point:\n   - If they finally adapt and play paper to counter my rock, I should play scissors\n   - If they stubbornly stick with scissors, I should play rock again\n8. The fact that they've lost three times to rock but continue playing scissors suggests either:\n   - They have a strong psychological bias toward scissors\n   - Or they're setting up for a major pattern break\n9. At this point, the probability of them changing strategy has increased significantly.\n10. If they do change to paper (to beat my expected rock), scissors would be my best counter.\n11. The risk of continuing with rock is higher now, as they've had multiple opportunities to recognize and break the pattern.\n12.

They've now played scissors in 10 out of 13 rounds (77% of the time).\n5. I've won four times, all with rock against their scissors.\n6. After four losses to rock, it becomes extremely likely that a rational player would adapt.\n7. However, this opponent has shown an almost irrational commitment to playing scissors.\n8. They've only deviated from scissors twice in 13 rounds (once with paper, once with rock).\n9. Given their demonstrated behavior pattern:\n   a) The probability of them playing scissors again remains very high\n   b) The probability of them finally adapting after four losses is also increasing\n10. If they continue with scissors, rock is my best move.\n11. If they finally adapt and play paper, rock would lose.\n12. If they switch to rock, we would tie.\n13. Given their extraordinary consistency with scissors despite repeated losses, the statistically optimal move remains rock.\n14. However, at some point they must adapt or they're playing completely irrationally.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite the increasing probability that my opponent might finally adapt, their demonstrated extreme preference for scissors (10/13 rounds) and my consistent success with rock against their scissors leads me to play rock again. Their pattern suggests they will likely continue with scissors despite multiple previous losses.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Despite losing to rock four times, they continue to play scissors, showing an extremely strong bias.\n7. At this point, I need to consider two possibilities:\n   a) My opponent has an overwhelming preference for scissors regardless of outcome\n   b) They're setting up for a major strategic shift after establishing a very strong pattern\n8. If they continue with scissors, rock is the optimal choice.\n9. If they finally adapt and play paper (to counter my rock), scissors would be optimal.\n10. Given their demonstrated history, the probability of them continuing with scissors is still high, but after four losses with the same pattern, the chance of adaptation increases.\n11. However, their commitment to scissors has been so strong that it outweighs normal strategic adaptation expectations.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite the risk of them finally adapting, their overwhelming preference for scissors (10/13 rounds) and failure to adapt after four losses suggests they will likely continue with scissors. I'll play rock again, which has consistently won against their scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This suggests they're becoming more adaptive and strategic in their choices.\n6. Their most recent sequence (paper \u2192 rock) suggests they might be thinking one step ahead of me.\n7. After successfully countering my scissors with rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n   b) Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   c) Return to scissors, thinking I might play paper to counter their rock\n8.

Given their recent adaptive behavior, they might:\n   a) Play rock to counter my expected scissors\n   b) Play paper to counter my expected rock\n   c) Stay with scissors expecting me to play paper\n9.

Since they've shown increased adaptability recently, rock seems like a good move as it would beat their scissors if they continue with it, and has been historically successful against this opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given my opponent's recent shift to more adaptive play, and the fact that they just played scissors (possibly returning to their preferred move), I'll play rock which would beat scissors if they continue with it or repeat their most common historical move.\n\n[move] rock\n",

However, they've also shown increased adaptability in recent rounds.\n13.
