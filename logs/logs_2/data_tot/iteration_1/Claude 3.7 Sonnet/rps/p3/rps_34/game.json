I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any historical data on their tendencies.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage.\n3. Rock, paper, and scissors each win against one option and lose against another.\n4. The payoffs are asymmetric: paper beating rock gives 3 points, while rock beating scissors or scissors beating paper only gives 1 point.\n5. This means that playing paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential penalty (-3 points).\n6. Since this is the first round with no information about my opponent, I need to make a choice without the benefit of pattern recognition.\n7. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest expected value if all three moves are equally likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it offers the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"
