    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any historical data on their tendencies.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no single move has a theoretical advantage.\n3. Rock, paper, and scissors each win against one option and lose against another.\n4. The payoffs are asymmetric: paper beating rock gives 3 points, while rock beating scissors or scissors beating paper only gives 1 point.\n5. This means that playing paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential penalty (-3 points).\n6. Since this is the first round with no information about my opponent, I need to make a choice without the benefit of pattern recognition.\n7. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest expected value if all three moves are equally likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it offers the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is a significant development - my opponent finally played rock for the first time in 11 rounds.\n3. Their overall move distribution is now: 4 papers, 6 scissors, 1 rock.\n4. After tying with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock, thinking I might stay with rock (resulting in another tie)\n   - Switch to paper to beat my potential rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I'll switch to paper\n\n5. Given that they just played rock for the first time after avoiding it for 10 rounds, this seems like a deliberate strategic shift.\n6. They might be more likely to continue with rock now that they've broken their pattern.\n7. If they continue with rock, paper would be my best counter.\n8. If they switch to paper, scissors would be best.\n9. If they switch to scissors, rock would be best.\n10. Given their historical preference for scissors and the fact they just tried rock, they might revert to their most common move (scissors).\n11. However, the logical progression after a tie with rock would be to play paper.\n12. Since paper beats rock and ties with paper, it offers a good expected value against their potential moves.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it beats rock if they continue with it and ties with paper if they switch to that.\n\n[move] paper\n"
