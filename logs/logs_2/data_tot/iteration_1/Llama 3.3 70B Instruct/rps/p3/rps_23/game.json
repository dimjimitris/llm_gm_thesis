        "To make my move, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n2. Recall the payoff matrix:\n   - rock beats scissors (+1, -1)\n   - paper beats rock (+3, -3)\n   - scissors beats paper (+1, -1)\n   - tie (0, 0)\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no prior information about their strategy or move history.\n4. Given no information, I'll make a random move to avoid any potential biases.\n\n[move] (Making a random move due to lack of information about the opponent's strategy) rock\n",
        "To make my move, I'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their previous moves or strategy.\n2. The goal is to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n3. I'll consider the payoff matrix:\n   - rock beats scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-3 points), ties with rock (0 points)\n   - paper beats rock (+3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point), ties with paper (0 points)\n   - scissors beats paper (+1 point), loses to rock (-1 point), ties with scissors (0 points)\n4. Given no information about the opponent, I'll choose a move that has a moderate potential reward and minimal potential penalty.\n5. I'll choose rock as my initial move, as it has a moderate reward (+1 point) and a significant penalty (-3 points) is less likely if the opponent chooses paper, which might not be their first choice.\n\n[move] (Choosing rock to test the opponent's strategy and minimize potential penalty) rock\n",
        "To begin the game, I'll start by analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes. \n\n1. The game is rock-paper-scissors, and the possible moves are rock, paper, and scissors.\n2. The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n   - rock beats scissors (1 point for rock, -1 point for scissors)\n   - paper beats rock (3 points for paper, -3 points for rock)\n   - scissors beats paper (1 point for scissors, -1 point for paper)\n   - If both players make the same move, the game is a tie (0 points for both)\n3. Since this is the first round and the player is fresh, there is no previous move to base my decision on.\n4. Given the payoffs, rock and scissors have lower stakes than paper, as the points won or lost are lower.\n5. To minimize potential losses, I'll choose a move that has a lower risk of losing a large number of points.\n6. Considering the lower stakes, I'll choose rock as my initial move to test the waters and gauge the opponent's strategy.\n\n[move] (Choosing rock to minimize potential losses and test the opponent's strategy) rock\n",
