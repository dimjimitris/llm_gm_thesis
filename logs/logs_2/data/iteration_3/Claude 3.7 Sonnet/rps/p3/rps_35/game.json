Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely meaning a new opponent or first round), I don't have prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3. Let me consider the payoff structure:\n   - Winning with paper gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - Winning with rock or scissors gives lower reward (+1 point)\n   - Losing to paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points) \n   - Losing to rock or scissors gives lower penalty (-1 point)\n4. Given this asymmetric payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward.\n5. Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their initial move based on psychological research.\n6. If my opponent plays rock, paper would give me +3 points.\n7. If my opponent plays paper, scissors would give me +1 point.\n8. If my opponent plays scissors, rock would give me +1 point.\n9. The expected value of playing paper seems highest given the combination of likely opponent behavior and the payoff structure.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy after losing.\n3. Common patterns in rock-paper-scissors suggest that players often:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (my opponent might switch to paper)\n   - Sometimes stick with their move hoping the opponent will overthink\n   - Occasionally switch to what would have lost to their opponent's previous move\n4. Given that I played paper last time, my opponent might expect me to play paper again or switch to scissors.\n5. If they expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors to counter.\n6. If they expect me to switch to scissors (anticipating their paper), they might play rock.\n7. Looking at the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I get +1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1 point\n8. Given that they lost significantly to paper (-3 points), they're more likely to switch away from rock.\n9.

If my opponent thinks I'll play rock, they might play paper to counter it.\n5. However, they might also anticipate this level of thinking and play scissors again or switch to rock.\n6.

They just played rock and beat my scissors, so they might:\n   - Stay with rock since it worked last time\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock to counter their previous rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I might play paper to counter their rock\n6.

This suggests:\n   - They've finally adjusted their strategy\n   - They may have recognized that their pattern was being exploited\n   - They're now making more deliberate, strategic choices\n\n5.

The most significant insight is that they're no longer predictable based on their previous pattern.\n\n7. In the absence of a clear pattern, I should consider general RPS strategy:\n   - After a tie, players often switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n   - This would suggest they might play paper (to beat the rock they just played)\n\n8.

My opponent's pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   Their last few moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. Looking at their overall situation:\n   - They've now lost 23 rounds, tied 4 rounds, and won only 1 round\n   - They've lost the last 18 consecutive rounds\n   - Despite this, they appear to be following an extremely predictable pattern\n\n4. Their most recent moves show a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper sequence, which is a standard cycle.\n   - If they're continuing this cycle, rock would be next\n   - This pattern has been remarkably consistent in their recent play\n\n5. Analyzing their recent pattern more closely:\n   - Rounds 25-27: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (a complete reverse cycle)\n   - Rounds 28-30 (including this round): scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ? (potentially continuing a reverse cycle)\n   - If they continue this pattern, rock would be next\n\n6. After losing with paper against my scissors, standard RPS psychology suggests they might:\n   - Play scissors to tie with my anticipated scissors\n   - Play rock to beat my anticipated scissors\n   - Avoid paper after just losing with it\n\n7. In this case, both their established pattern and standard RPS psychology after a loss point to rock as their next move.\n\n8. If they play rock, paper would be my best move (+3 points).\n9. If they play scissors, rock would be my best move (+1 point).\n10. If they play paper again, scissors would be my best move (+1 point).\n\n11. Considering their recent loss with paper, their extremely consistent pattern of reverse cycles, and standard RPS psychology after a loss, rock seems to be their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
