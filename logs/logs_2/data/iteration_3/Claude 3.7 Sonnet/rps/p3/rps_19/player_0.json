Let me try yet another approach.\n\n[move] Rock\n\nI've chosen rock for this round. Since I just lost with paper against their scissors, conventional strategy might suggest I play rock next to counter their scissors. However, they've been anticipating my moves consistently. They might expect me to play rock now and counter with paper, or they might think I'll try to be unpredictable and play scissors or paper again. \n\nGiven our history, I'm choosing rock because: 1) If they play scissors again, I win; 2) If they overthink and expect me to avoid the obvious rock choice, they might play scissors again or switch to paper. I need to break this losing streak, and at this point introducing some fundamental strategy might be my best option.\n"

Since I just lost with rock against their paper, my opponent might expect me to continue changing my strategy and play paper next, leading them to play scissors. Or they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper and switch to rock.\n\nAt this point, I'm facing an opponent who has consistently outplayed me in terms of prediction. Rather than trying to out-think them further, I'm choosing scissors as a direct counter to their last move (paper). Sometimes the simplest approach - responding directly to what they just played - might break a pattern of overthinking. If they maintain paper, I win; if they switch, then I'll have new information about their strategy.\n"

Since I just lost with rock against their paper, my opponent might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper, and play rock in anticipation. Or they might expect me to overthink and stick with rock or switch to paper, leading them to play scissors or paper again.\n\nGiven that they've been consistently one step ahead of me throughout this game, I'm going to try paper - not because I think it's the optimal counter to what they might play next, but because introducing more randomness into my strategy might be the only way to break their ability to predict my moves. If their pattern is to consistently counter what I'm likely to play, perhaps a less predictable choice will catch them off guard.\n"
