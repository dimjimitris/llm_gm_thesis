    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've now played paper six times in a row.\n\n3. Overall, their moves have been:\n   - Paper: 8 times (80% of their moves)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (20% of their moves)\n   - Rock: 0 times (still never played)\n\n4. This behavior is remarkably consistent and suggests:\n   - They're using a fixed strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They strongly prefer playing paper despite repeatedly losing\n   - They might be programmed or following a specific rule\n\n5. Given that they've lost with paper multiple times but continue to play it, the rational choice is to continue exploiting this pattern with scissors.\n\n6. There is always the possibility they could suddenly change their strategy after multiple losses, but their history suggests this is unlikely.\n\n7. The risk-reward for scissors:\n   - If they play paper (their overwhelming favorite): I win +1\n   - If they play scissors (their only other move): tie 0\n   - If they play rock (never played before): I lose -1\n\n8. Even if they do change, the expected value of playing scissors is positive given their strong paper preference.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the opponent's extremely consistent pattern of playing paper despite repeated losses, I'll continue with scissors which has proven highly effective.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've broken their scissors streak and switched to paper.\n\n3. Overall, their moves have been:\n   - Paper: 9 times (50% of their moves)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (28% of their moves)\n   - Rock: 4 times (22% of their moves)\n\n4. Looking at their broader patterns:\n   - They seem to establish streaks of a single move (paper, then rock, then scissors)\n   - They eventually break these streaks, often after I successfully counter multiple times\n   - Paper remains their most commonly played move overall\n\n5. After successfully countering my rock with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, reverting to their most frequent move\n   - Switch to a different move to be unpredictable\n   - Start a new streak with paper\n\n6. Given their tendency to establish streaks after successful moves, paper is a likely choice again.\n\n7. If they play paper again, scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\n8. The risk-reward for scissors:\n   - If they play paper (their last successful move): I win +1\n   - If they play rock (less likely based on recency): I lose -1\n   - If they play scissors (their previous streak): tie 0\n\n9. While there's always risk they might play rock, their historical preference for establishing streaks after successful moves suggests paper is more likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent just successfully played paper after a scissors streak, and they have historically established new streaks after successful moves, I'll play scissors to counter their potential continued use of paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock three times in a row.\n\n3. Overall, their moves have been:\n   - Paper: 12 times (50% of their moves)\n   - Rock: 7 times (29% of their moves)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (21% of their moves)\n\n4. Looking at their broader patterns:\n   - They played paper 6 times in a row early in the game\n   - Then played rock 4 times in a row\n   - Then played scissors 3 times in a row\n   - Then played paper 4 times in a row\n   - Now they've played rock 3 times in a row\n   - They establish very clear streaks of the same move\n\n5. After losing with rock twice in a row, they might:\n   - Continue with rock despite the losses (consistent with their previous stubborn behavior)\n   - Finally switch to a different move after multiple consecutive losses\n\n6. Their historical pattern strongly suggests they tend to stick with moves for extended periods (3-6 rounds) even after multiple losses.\n\n7. If they continue with rock, paper remains the optimal counter.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors, rock would be optimal.\n\n9. If they switch back to paper, scissors would be optimal.\n\n10. Given their remarkably consistent pattern of sticking with moves for extended streaks despite losses, paper remains the most rational choice.\n\n11. However, they've now lost with rock twice in a row, which might finally trigger a change in their strategy.\n\n12. Based on their previous behavior:\n    - Their paper streak early in the game lasted 6 rounds\n    - Their first rock streak lasted 4 rounds\n    - Their scissors streak lasted 3 rounds\n    - Their second paper streak lasted 4 rounds\n    - Their current rock streak has lasted 3 rounds so far\n\n13. The risk-reward for paper:\n    - If they play rock again (consistent with their streaking behavior): I win +3\n    - If they play scissors (potential strategic switch): I lose -1\n    - If they play paper (their most frequent move overall): tie 0\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: While I recognize the increasing risk they might switch after losing with rock twice in a row, their historical pattern of sticking with moves for extended streaks (3-6 rounds) suggests they might continue with rock. I'll play paper again to counter their likely continued use of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played rock 4 times in a row, matching the length of their previous rock streak.\n\n8. This suggests they might be more likely to switch in the next round based on their pattern.\n\n9. If they continue with rock, paper remains the optimal counter.\n\n10. If they switch to scissors (which would match their pattern of switching after ~4 rounds), rock would be optimal.\n\n11. If they switch back to paper (their most frequent move overall), scissors would be optimal.\n\n12. Given they've now reached the same streak length (4) as their previous rock streak, and they've lost repeatedly, the probability of them switching has significantly increased.\n\n13. Rock would be the safest counter if they switch to scissors, which seems increasingly likely given their pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent has consistently established streaks of specific lengths and they've now matched their previous rock streak length while losing repeatedly, I believe they're likely to switch to scissors. I'll play rock to counter this anticipated move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their historical pattern strongly suggests they tend to stick with moves for extended periods (4-6 rounds for paper) even after losses.\n\n8. If they continue with paper, scissors remains the optimal counter.\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would be optimal.\n\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would be optimal.\n\n11. The risk-reward for scissors:\n    - If they play paper again (consistent with their streaking behavior): I win +1\n    - If they play rock (less likely based on their pattern): I lose -1\n    - If they play scissors (less likely based on recency): tie 0\n\n12. Given their strong historical tendency to establish streaks of specific lengths, and their current paper streak being only 2 rounds (while their historical paper streaks last 4-6 rounds), scissors remains the most rational choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Since my opponent has consistently established streaks of specific lengths with each move type, and they've historically played paper for 4-6 rounds in a streak, I'll play scissors again to counter their likely continued use of paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
