Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My total score is now -1 after winning 1 point in the last round.\n\n4. The opponent has played paper in 6 out of 10 rounds (60%), showing a strong preference.\n\n5. I just won with scissors against their paper, so they're likely to change their strategy.\n\n6. After losing to scissors, they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and play paper to counter their expected rock, so they might play scissors.\n\n8. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing in Round 3, they switched from rock to paper\n   - After losing in Round 5, they switched from scissors to paper\n\n9. Their pattern after losses suggests they tend to switch to paper, but they just lost with paper, so this pattern might not hold.\n\n10. Their most consistent behavior has been playing paper regardless of outcomes.\n\n11. Given their strong paper preference and the psychological tendency to avoid repeating a losing move, they might play rock or scissors.\n\n12. If they play rock (to counter my previous scissors), my best move would be paper.\n\n13. If they play scissors (breaking their paper preference), my best move would be rock.\n\n14.

My total score remains -1 after another tie.\n\n4. We've now had 6 ties out of 11 rounds (54.5%), continuing the trend of high tie frequency.\n\n5. The opponent switched from paper to rock after losing with paper, confirming they tend to change strategy after losses.\n\n6. After our tie with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock.\n\n7. If they anticipate paper from me, they would likely play scissors.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 2 times\n\n9. Their paper preference remains strong, but they've shown a willingness to adapt.\n\n10. The opponent seems to be thinking similarly to me, resulting in many ties, which suggests they might be using similar reasoning processes.\n\n11. To break this pattern, I need to think about what they expect me to do and counter that expectation.\n\n12. The most conventional move after a rock tie would be paper (to win against their potential rock).\n\n13. They likely anticipate this and might play scissors to counter.\n\n14. If I predict they'll play scissors, my best move would be rock.\n\n15. However, given our history of ties, they might also stick with rock expecting another tie or anticipating my deeper reasoning.\n\n16. Given the cyclical nature of the game and their adaptability, paper seems to be the optimal move - it beats their potential rock and loses to their potential scissors.\n\n17. Considering the higher reward for winning with paper (3 points) versus the lower penalty for losing with it (-1 points), the risk-reward ratio favors playing paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

My total score is now -2 after losing 1 point in the last round.\n\n4. The opponent successfully anticipated my paper play with scissors, suggesting they're thinking one step ahead of my reasoning.\n\n5. Looking at their recent sequence (paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), there's a pattern of cycling through moves.\n\n6. After winning with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock anticipating their scissors\n\n7. Examining their behavior after wins:\n   - After winning in Round 4, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 7, they played scissors\n   - Now they just won with scissors in Round 12\n\n8. This suggests they might follow scissors with another move, possibly continuing their apparent cycle.\n\n9.

The opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My total score remains -5 after another tie.\n\n4. We've now had 11 ties out of 18 rounds (61.1%), an extraordinarily high frequency that suggests an unusual dynamic.\n\n5. The recent sequence shows rock (tie) \u2192 scissors (tie) \u2192 paper (tie), completing a full cycle of ties through all three moves.\n\n6. This suggests we're either thinking extremely similarly or the opponent has found a way to successfully mirror or predict my moves.\n\n7. After our tie with paper, conventional wisdom would suggest playing scissors to beat their potential paper repeat.\n\n8. However, given our history of ties, they likely anticipate this and might play rock.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 9 times (50%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (22.2%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (27.8%)\n\n10. Their paper preference remains consistent at 50% of their moves.\n\n11. The unprecedented tie rate suggests a need for a completely different approach.\n\n12. Breaking the predictable cycle after paper (scissors) would mean playing something unexpected like rock.\n\n13. If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), my rock would win.\n\n14. If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), my rock would tie.\n\n15. If they play paper again, my rock would lose.\n\n16. Given the need to break this extraordinary tie pattern and the psychological dynamics at play, rock seems to be the optimal move as it counters their potential scissors play while accepting the risk against their paper preference.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

My total score is now -8 after losing 3 more points.\n\n4. The opponent has played paper in 10 out of 19 rounds (52.6%), reinforcing their strong preference for this move.\n\n5. After winning with paper, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper anticipating their rock\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after winning with paper specifically:\n   - After winning with paper in Round 4, they played scissors\n   - After winning with paper in Round 7, they played scissors\n   - After winning with paper in Round 13, they played scissors\n\n7. This suggests a strong pattern where they follow a paper win with scissors.\n\n8. Given this clear pattern and their recent paper play, scissors seems highly likely from them.\n\n9. If they play scissors as expected, my best move would be rock.\n\n10. If they break their pattern and play paper again, my rock would lose.\n\n11. If they play rock, my rock would tie.\n\n12.

My total score remains -8 after another tie.\n\n4. We've now had 12 ties out of 20 rounds (60%), continuing the extraordinary tie frequency.\n\n5. The opponent broke their pattern of playing scissors after winning with paper, instead playing rock.\n\n6. After our tie with rock, conventional wisdom would suggest playing paper to beat their potential rock repeat.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 10 times (50%)\n   - Rock: 5 times (25%)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (25%)\n\n8. Their paper preference remains consistent at exactly half of their moves.\n\n9. Looking at their behavior after rock ties specifically:\n   - After rock tie in Round 2, they played rock again\n   - After rock tie in Round 11, they played scissors\n   - After rock tie in Round 16, they played scissors\n\n10. This suggests they tend to follow rock ties with either rock again or scissors.\n\n11. Given the extremely high tie rate, they might be successfully anticipating my moves or we're thinking very similarly.\n\n12. After a rock tie, most players would expect paper, so playing scissors would be a counter to that expected paper.\n\n13.

The opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My total score is now -9 after losing 1 more point.\n\n4. The opponent played rock after a paper tie, confirming one of their patterns observed after paper ties.\n\n5. After winning with rock, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock anticipating their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper countering their expected paper\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after winning with rock specifically:\n   - After winning with rock in Round 24 (just now), they have no established pattern\n\n7. However, looking at their general pattern after wins:\n   - After winning in Round 4 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 7 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 12 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After winning in Round 13 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 19 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in Round 21 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After winning in Round 24 with rock, they might follow a similar pattern\n\n8. They don't show a consistent pattern after wins, but they often switch moves.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 12 times (50%)\n   - Rock: 6 times (25%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (25%)\n\n10. Their paper preference remains at exactly half of their total moves.\n\n11. Given their tendency to switch after wins and their overall paper preference, paper seems likely from them.\n\n12. If they play paper as expected, my best move would be scissors.\n\n13. If they play rock again, my scissors would lose.\n\n14. If they play scissors (breaking their pattern), my scissors would tie.\n\n15. Considering their historical pattern of switching after wins, their overall paper preference, and the psychological dynamics after winning, scissors seems to be the optimal move despite the risk of them playing rock again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My total score remains -9 after another tie.\n\n4. We've now had 14 ties out of 25 rounds (56%), continuing the extraordinary tie frequency.\n\n5. The opponent switched from rock to scissors despite winning with rock, breaking their usual pattern after wins.\n\n6. After our tie with scissors, conventional wisdom would suggest playing rock to beat their potential scissors repeat.\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 12 times (48%)\n   - Rock: 6 times (24%)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (28%)\n\n8. Their paper preference remains strong, though scissors has increased in frequency.\n\n9. Looking at their behavior after scissors ties specifically:\n   - After scissors tie in Round 8, they played paper\n   - After scissors tie in Round 14, they played paper\n   - After scissors tie in Round 17, they played paper\n   - After scissors tie in Round 25 (just now), they might follow the same pattern\n\n10. This suggests they consistently follow scissors ties with paper, showing a strong pattern.\n\n11. Given the high tie rate, they might be successfully anticipating my moves or we're thinking very similarly.\n\n12. After a scissors tie, based on their strong historical pattern, they are very likely to play paper.\n\n13. If they play paper as expected, my best move would be scissors.\n\n14. If they play rock (breaking their strong pattern after scissors ties), my scissors would lose.\n\n15. If they play scissors again, my scissors would tie.\n\n16. Considering their remarkably consistent pattern of playing paper after scissors ties, scissors seems to be the optimal move despite the risk.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My total score is now -8 after winning 1 point.\n\n4. The opponent played paper after a scissors tie, confirming their consistent pattern observed after scissors ties.\n\n5. After losing to my scissors, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Switch away from paper since it just lost\n   - Play rock to beat my potential scissors repeat\n   - Play scissors if they think I'll switch to paper anticipating their rock\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losing specifically:\n   - After losing in Round 3, they switched from rock to paper\n   - After losing in Round 5, they switched from scissors to paper\n   - After losing in Round 10, they switched from paper to rock\n   - After losing in Round 22, they switched from paper to paper (no change)\n   - After losing in Round 26 (just now), they might follow a similar pattern\n\n7.

My total score is now -5 after winning 3 points.\n\n4. The opponent played rock after losing with paper, following their pattern of switching after losses.\n\n5. After losing to my paper, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Switch away from rock since it just lost\n   - Play paper to beat my potential rock repeat\n   - Play scissors if they think I'll switch to paper anticipating their paper\n\n6.

The opponent played scissors after losing with rock, following their pattern of switching after losses.\n\n6. After losing to my rock, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Switch away from scissors since it just lost\n   - Play rock to beat my potential paper (if they think I'll switch)\n   - Play paper to beat my potential rock repeat\n\n7.

The opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My total score is now -5 after losing 1 point.\n\n4. The opponent played rock after losing with scissors, breaking my winning streak.\n\n5. After winning with rock, their historical pattern suggests they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock anticipating their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper countering their expected paper\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after winning specifically:\n   - After winning in Round 4 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 7 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 12 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After winning in Round 13 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 19 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in Round 21 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After winning in Round 24 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 29 with rock, they might follow a similar pattern\n\n7. They tend to switch moves after winning, with a preference for switching to scissors after winning with paper or rock.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Paper: 13 times (44.8%)\n   - Rock: 8 times (27.6%)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (27.6%)\n\n9. Their paper preference remains strong, though it has decreased slightly.\n\n10. Given their pattern of switching after wins and specifically switching to scissors after winning with rock (as in Round 24), scissors seems likely from them.\n\n11. If they play scissors as expected, my best move would be rock.\n\n12. If they play paper (following their general preference), my rock would lose.\n\n13. If they play rock again (against their pattern of switching after wins), my rock would tie.\n\n14. Considering their historical pattern of switching after wins, specifically to scissors after winning with rock, and the psychological dynamics after breaking my winning streak, rock seems to be the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"
