    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given that they've played paper twice in a row and won with it last round, they might be confident in playing paper again.\n17. However, playing the same move three times in a row is uncommon in rock-paper-scissors.\n18. The most likely scenario is that they'll switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper.\n19. If I predict they'll play scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their potential scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After scissors, they've played paper (4 times) and rock (1 time).\n10. They have a very strong tendency to play paper after scissors (80% of the time).\n11.

After our tie with scissors, I need to predict their next move.\n7. Looking at what they've done after scissors:\n   - After Round 4 (scissors): They played paper\n   - After Round 7 (scissors): They played rock\n   - After Round 9 (scissors): They played paper\n   - After Round 14 (scissors): They played paper\n   - After Round 19 (scissors): They played paper\n   - After Round 21 (scissors): They played scissors\n   - Now after Round 22 (scissors): ?\n8.

Additionally, after ties, they've changed their move 7 out of 9 previous times.\n11. This is the first time they've played scissors twice in a row (Rounds 21-22).\n12. Given that they just broke their pattern by playing scissors twice in a row, they're likely to change now.\n13. Based on their historical tendency to play paper after scissors and to change moves after ties, paper seems most likely.\n14. If I predict they'll play paper, I should play scissors.\n15. However, given our high tie rate and their recent pattern break, they might anticipate scissors from me and play rock.\n16. Balancing these factors, I'll stick with their strongest historical pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their potential paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is the first time they've played the same move (scissors) three times in a row.\n7. After three consecutive scissors plays, they're very likely to change their move.\n8. In rock-paper-scissors, playing the same move more than twice in a row is rare.\n9. After our tie with scissors, they might expect me to:\n   a) Play rock to beat their scissors if I expect them to play scissors again\n   b) Play scissors again, thinking they'll switch\n   c) Play paper, thinking they'll play rock to beat my expected scissors\n10. Given that they've now played scissors three times in a row, the probability of them playing scissors a fourth time is very low.\n11. They're most likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n12. Rock would be a logical choice if they expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors streak).\n13. Paper would be logical if they expect me to play scissors again or if they're following their most common pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n14. Given their historical preference for paper (9 times vs. 6 times for rock) and their pattern of playing paper after scissors, paper seems more likely.\n15. If I predict they'll play paper, I should play scissors.\n16. However, after such a clear pattern of three scissors in a row, they might be more likely to break their paper-after-scissors pattern and play rock instead.\n17.

            "text": "I'll analyze the game history and think through my next move step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Round 1-28: (Previous history noted)\n2. Round 29: We both played paper (tie).\n3. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n4. Their move frequencies: paper (13), rock (8), scissors (8).\n5. We've now had thirteen ties in twenty-nine rounds (45%), which is remarkably high.\n6. After our tie with paper, I need to predict their next move.\n7. Looking at what they've done after paper:\n   - After Round 1 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 3 (paper): They played scissors\n   - After Round 5 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 10 (paper): They played paper again\n   - After Round 11 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 13 (paper): They played scissors\n   - After Round 15 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 17 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 20 (paper): They played scissors\n   - After Round 24 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 26 (paper): They played rock\n   - After Round 28 (paper): They played paper\n   - Now after Round 29 (paper): ?\n8. After paper, they've played rock (7 times), scissors (3 times), and paper (2 times).\n9. They have a strong tendency to play rock after paper (58% of the time).\n10. Additionally, after ties, they've changed their move 7 out of 12 previous times (58%).\n11. Given both their historical tendency to play rock after paper and to change moves after ties, rock seems most likely.\n12. If I predict they'll play rock, I should play paper.\n13. However, their recent behavior has shown some deviations from their patterns, and they've played paper frequently lately.\n14. Balancing these factors, I'll still go with their strongest historical pattern of playing rock after paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their potential rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
