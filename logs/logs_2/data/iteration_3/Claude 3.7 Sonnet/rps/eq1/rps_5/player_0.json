    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the larger pattern, after ties they've often played the same move as before or completed a natural progression:\n   - After the rock tie in round 2, they played scissors in round 3\n   - After the paper tie in round 5, they played paper again in round 6\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they played paper in round 10\n   - After the rock tie in round 12, they played scissors in round 13\n\n11. Given this pattern and the natural progression from rock, I think they're most likely to play paper this round.\n\n12.

My record is now: 5 wins, 5 losses, and 9 ties.\n\n4. We've now had 9 ties out of 19 rounds (47%), which is remarkably high and suggests we're often thinking similarly.\n\n5. Looking at how my opponent responds after scissors ties:\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they played paper in round 10\n\n6. The pattern from their last three moves shows: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   This could be part of a larger pattern they're establishing.\n\n7. After a scissors tie, there are a few likely possibilities:\n   - They might play rock (countering the expected paper that counters scissors)\n   - They might play paper (completing a natural progression from scissors)\n   - They might play scissors again (persistence, though less likely)\n\n8. Given our high tie rate, they might be trying to break the pattern of ties by making a less predictable move.\n\n9. Looking at their overall strategy, they've shown an ability to anticipate my moves and adapt accordingly.\n\n10. After ties, they often switch to a different move, particularly following the natural rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n11.

Since they've won with scissors twice (rounds 13 and 20), we can look specifically at what they did after the round 13 win: they played paper in round 14.\n\n10.

My opponent's move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. My record is now: 5 wins, 8 losses, and 12 ties.\n\n4. The opponent has played paper twice in a row now.\n\n5. Looking at their previous paper streaks:\n   - After three papers (rounds 4-6), they switched to rock\n   - After three papers (rounds 15-17), they switched to rock\n   - This suggests they might continue with paper once more before switching\n\n6. My opponent has won the last round, which might influence their strategy.\n\n7. Looking at how they behave after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 6, they played rock in round 7\n   - After winning with paper in round 16, they played rock in round 17\n   - This suggests they often play rock after winning with paper\n\n8. Given these patterns and their demonstrated strategic thinking, they might:\n   - Play rock (following their pattern after paper wins)\n   - Continue with paper (completing a third consecutive paper play)\n   - Play scissors (breaking their established patterns)\n\n9. Based on their historical patterns after winning with paper, I think they're most likely to play rock this round.\n\n10. To counter their anticipated rock move, I should play paper.\n\n11. However, given our high tie rate and their ability to anticipate my moves, they might expect this and play scissors instead.\n\n12. Weighing these factors, and considering their strongest pattern of playing rock after winning with paper, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My record is now: 6 wins, 8 losses, and 12 ties.\n\n4. I just won with paper against their rock. Looking at how my opponent responds after losses:\n   - After losing in round 4 with paper, they stayed with paper in round 5\n   - After losing in round 8 with scissors, they stayed with scissors in round 9\n   - After losing in round 11 with rock, they stayed with rock in round 12\n   - After losing in round 14 with paper, they stayed with paper in round 15\n   - After losing in round 17 with rock, they stayed with rock in round 18\n   - This suggests they often stick with the same move after losing\n\n5. However, they've also shown they can break patterns and adapt their strategy.\n\n6. Given I've just won with paper, they might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their overall behavior after losing, there's a strong pattern of them repeating the same move that just lost.\n\n8. If they follow this pattern, they'll play rock again.\n\n9. However, given my clear win with paper, they might be more motivated to change their strategy.\n\n10. Considering all factors - their tendency to repeat moves after losses, but also their strategic thinking and pattern breaking - I think they're slightly more likely to switch to scissors this round to counter my expected paper.\n\n11.

The opponent switched from rock to paper, breaking their pattern of repeating moves after losses.\n\n6. Looking at how they behave after paper ties:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played rock in round 2\n   - After paper tie in round 5, they played paper again in round 6\n   - After paper tie in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n   - After paper tie in round 15, they played paper in round 16\n   - After paper tie in round 24, they played paper in round 25\n   - This suggests they often play either paper or rock after a paper tie\n\n7. Given this mixed pattern and their demonstrated strategic thinking, they might:\n   - Play rock (following part of their pattern after paper ties)\n   - Continue with paper (following another part of their pattern)\n   - Play scissors (breaking their established patterns)\n\n8. Since we just tied with paper, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their expected paper, and therefore play rock.\n\n9. Looking at their overall strategy, they've shown they can anticipate my moves and adapt accordingly.\n\n10. Given the high frequency of ties and their pattern of often playing rock after paper ties, I think they're slightly more likely to play rock this round.\n\n11. To counter their anticipated rock move, I should play paper.\n\n12. However, given our high tie rate and their ability to predict my moves, they might anticipate this reasoning and play scissors instead.\n\n13.
