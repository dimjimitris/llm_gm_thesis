After losses, my opponent has shown different reactions:\n   - Sometimes they stick with the same move (after losing with paper in round 4)\n   - Sometimes they switch (after losing with scissors in round 8)\n\n5. Given that I've won with paper, they might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n6. Looking at recent trends, after our streak of ties was broken with my win, they might be more determined to win this round.\n\n7. Their overall pattern shows some cyclical tendencies (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), and they just played rock, which might suggest scissors as their next move following this pattern.\n\n8. However, they've also demonstrated adaptive strategy, often trying to counter what they think I'll play.\n\n9. If they think I'll play paper again after my success, they'll play scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll anticipate this and play rock, they might play paper.\n\n11.

My opponent's move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My record is now: 5 wins, 5 losses, and 9 ties.\n\n4. We've now had 9 ties out of 19 rounds (47%), which is remarkably high and suggests we're often thinking similarly.\n\n5. Looking at how my opponent responds after scissors ties:\n   - After the scissors tie in round 9, they played paper in round 10\n\n6. The pattern from their last three moves shows: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   This could be part of a larger pattern they're establishing.\n\n7. After a scissors tie, there are a few likely possibilities:\n   - They might play rock (countering the expected paper that counters scissors)\n   - They might play paper (completing a natural progression from scissors)\n   - They might play scissors again (persistence, though less likely)\n\n8. Given our high tie rate, they might be trying to break the pattern of ties by making a less predictable move.\n\n9. Looking at their overall strategy, they've shown an ability to anticipate my moves and adapt accordingly.\n\n10. After ties, they often switch to a different move, particularly following the natural rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n11. Given these factors and the natural progression from scissors, I think they're most likely to play rock this round.\n\n12. To counter their anticipated rock move, I should play paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My record is now: 5 wins, 6 losses, and 9 ties.\n\n4. The opponent has now played scissors twice in a row, which forms a pattern.\n\n5. Looking at how they behave after winning:\n   - After winning in round 3 with scissors, they played paper in round 4\n   - After winning in round 6 with paper, they played rock in round 7\n   - After winning in round 7 with rock, they played scissors in round 8\n   - After winning in round 13 with scissors, they played paper in round 14\n   - After winning in round 16 with paper, they played rock in round 17\n\n6. This suggests after winning with scissors, they often play paper next.\n\n7. However, they've also shown they can break patterns and adapt their strategy.\n\n8. Given they've just won with scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (following their historical pattern after scissors wins)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Continue with scissors (persistence, though less likely given their patterns)\n\n9. Since they've won with scissors twice (rounds 13 and 20), we can look specifically at what they did after the round 13 win: they played paper in round 14.\n\n10. Looking at their overall strategy and their tendency to follow patterns after wins, I think they're most likely to play paper this round.\n\n11. To counter their anticipated paper move, I should play scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent's last three moves show: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   This suggests they might be establishing a new pattern or responding to my moves.\n\n7. After winning with rock, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (following a natural progression from rock)\n   - Stay with rock (since it was successful)\n   - Switch to scissors (to break an expected pattern)\n\n8. Given that they've just won with rock against my scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock to counter their rock, and therefore play paper.\n\n9. Looking at their overall strategy, they've shown they can anticipate my moves effectively and adapt their strategy.\n\n10. After winning rounds, they often switch to a move that would counter what they expect me to play next.\n\n11.

This suggests they tend to switch after playing the same move multiple times.\n\n8. After three consecutive scissors, there are a few likely possibilities:\n   - They might switch to rock (following a natural progression from scissors)\n   - They might switch to paper (breaking the pattern completely)\n   - They might continue with scissors (less likely given their history)\n\n9.

The opponent switched from three consecutive scissors to paper, breaking their streak.\n\n6. Looking at our recent moves:\n   - After three scissors ties, we both switched to paper (tie)\n   - This suggests our thinking processes might be very similar\n\n7. After a paper tie, there are a few likely possibilities:\n   - They might play scissors (following a natural progression from paper)\n   - They might play rock (breaking the expected pattern)\n   - They might play paper again (persistence, though less likely)\n\n8. Given our extremely high tie rate, they might be deliberately trying to break this pattern.\n\n9.

Looking at how they behave after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in round 6, they played rock in round 7\n   - After winning with paper in round 16, they played rock in round 17\n   - This suggests they often play rock after winning with paper\n\n8. Given these patterns and their demonstrated strategic thinking, they might:\n   - Play rock (following their pattern after paper wins)\n   - Continue with paper (completing a third consecutive paper play)\n   - Play scissors (breaking their established patterns)\n\n9. Based on their historical patterns after winning with paper, I think they're most likely to play rock this round.\n\n10. To counter their anticipated rock move, I should play paper.\n\n11. However, given our high tie rate and their ability to anticipate my moves, they might expect this and play scissors instead.\n\n12. Weighing these factors, and considering their strongest pattern of playing rock after winning with paper, I'll choose paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

However, they've also shown they can break patterns and adapt their strategy.\n\n6. Given I've just won with paper, they might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their overall behavior after losing, there's a strong pattern of them repeating the same move that just lost.\n\n8. If they follow this pattern, they'll play rock again.\n\n9. However, given my clear win with paper, they might be more motivated to change their strategy.\n\n10.

Looking at how they behave after paper ties:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played rock in round 2\n   - After paper tie in round 5, they played paper again in round 6\n   - After paper tie in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n   - After paper tie in round 15, they played paper in round 16\n   - After paper tie in round 24, they played paper in round 25\n   - This suggests they often play either paper or rock after a paper tie\n\n7. Given this mixed pattern and their demonstrated strategic thinking, they might:\n   - Play rock (following part of their pattern after paper ties)\n   - Continue with paper (following another part of their pattern)\n   - Play scissors (breaking their established patterns)\n\n8. Since we just tied with paper, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their expected paper, and therefore play rock.\n\n9.

Given the high frequency of ties and their pattern of often playing rock after paper ties, I think they're slightly more likely to play rock this round.\n\n11.

Paper would be logical if they expect me to play scissors again or if they're following their most common pattern of playing paper after scissors.\n14. Given their historical preference for paper (9 times vs. 6 times for rock) and their pattern of playing paper after scissors, paper seems more likely.\n15. If I predict they'll play paper, I should play scissors.\n16. However, after such a clear pattern of three scissors in a row, they might be more likely to break their paper-after-scissors pattern and play rock instead.\n17. Considering the unusual circumstance of three scissors in a row, rock seems like their most probable next move.\n18. If I predict they'll play rock, I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their potential rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
