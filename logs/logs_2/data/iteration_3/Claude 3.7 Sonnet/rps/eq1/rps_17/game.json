In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n5. People often choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as studies have shown it's a common first choice.\n6. If the opponent chose rock, my best response would be paper.\n7. However, since I have no way to know their move, I'll make a balanced choice.\n8. I'll choose paper for this first round, which would beat rock if they went with the common first move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me some information about my opponent's behavior.\n3. After losing with rock, opponents often switch their strategy in predictable ways.\n4. Many players follow a pattern called \"win-stay, lose-shift\" - meaning since my opponent lost, they're likely to shift away from rock.\n5. The most common shift after losing with rock is to scissors (thinking: \"I'll cut that paper next time\").\n6. If I expect them to play scissors this round, my best counter would be rock.\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll continue with paper since it worked, and choose scissors to counter that.\n8. Given that they likely won't play rock again after losing with it, and scissors is a probable choice for them, I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has shown a pattern of shifting their move each round: first rock, then scissors.\n3. This suggests they might be following a cyclical pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) or adapting based on their losses.\n4. Since they lost with scissors, following the \"lose-shift\" pattern, they're likely to change to paper this round.\n5. They might also be recognizing that I've correctly anticipated their moves twice, so they could be trying to get ahead of my prediction.\n6. If they expect me to play rock again (since it worked last time), they would indeed play paper.\n7. However, they might also try to be more unpredictable after losing twice.\n8.

They might assume I'll expect rock and play scissors to counter, so they might skip to scissors to beat my expected paper.\n7. Or they could completely randomize to throw me off.\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
