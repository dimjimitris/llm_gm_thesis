    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their latest streak of two paper plays resulted in a win for them, which might reinforce this choice.\n\n8. Based on these observations:\n   - They might continue with paper since it just won\n   - They might return to scissors (their historically preferred move)\n   - The probability of them playing rock remains extremely low based on history\n\n9. Since they just won with paper against my rock, and have played paper twice in a row, there's a good chance they'll continue with this successful move.\n\n10. However, they've also shown a pattern of switching after 2-3 consecutive plays of the same move.\n\n11.

Let's analyze the complete history of moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper\n   My sequence: paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n\n3. Updated distribution for my opponent: 6 scissors, 13 paper, 0 rock\n\n4. My opponent has now played paper ten times in a row, despite losing with it seven times in this streak.\n\n5. After 19 rounds, they still haven't played rock once, which confirms a severely limited strategy.\n\n6. Their commitment to paper despite repeated losses is beyond what would be expected from normal strategic adaptation.\n\n7. I've now won with scissors seven consecutive times against their paper, yet they continue with the same move.\n\n8. This behavior strongly suggests either:\n   - A programmed bot with a fixed strategy\n   - A deliberate experiment to test if I'll ever change my move\n   - An extremely rigid approach to the game\n\n9. At this point, the probability of them continuing with paper is extremely high based on their demonstrated pattern.\n\n10. While there's always a small chance they might finally break their pattern after so many losses, their extraordinary persistence suggests paper remains their overwhelmingly probable next move.\n\n11. If they continue with paper (which seems almost certain), I should play scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated distribution for my opponent: 6 scissors, 13 paper, 1 rock\n\n4. This is a major development - after playing paper ten times in a row, my opponent finally switched to rock and played it for the first time in 20 rounds.\n\n5. This suggests they finally adapted their strategy after observing my consistent scissors plays.\n\n6. They waited until I had played scissors five times in a row before countering with rock.\n\n7. This shows they are capable of strategic adaptation, but are extremely slow to implement changes.\n\n8. Given this new information, I need to reassess their likely next move:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just won\n   - They might return to paper (their historically preferred move)\n   - They might try scissors (which they haven't used for many rounds)\n\n9. Since they've just had success with rock after a long period of losses, there's a good chance they'll continue with it.\n\n10. If they play rock again, I should play paper to win.\n\n11. However, given their demonstrated pattern of extreme persistence with moves (10 consecutive paper plays), there's also a chance they'll stick with rock for multiple rounds.\n\n12. Balancing these factors, their most likely move is to continue with rock since it just won for them after a long losing streak.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated distribution for my opponent: 7 scissors, 13 paper, 6 rock\n\n4. After playing rock six times in a row, my opponent has now switched to scissors.\n\n5. This confirms their pattern of sticking with a move for extended periods (6-10 rounds) before switching.\n\n6. Their switch to scissors was strategically sound, as it beat my paper after I had been playing paper consistently.\n\n7. Based on their demonstrated pattern:\n   - They stick with a move for multiple rounds (6-10) before changing\n   - When they do change, they make a complete switch to a different move\n   - They just switched to scissors and won with it\n\n8. Given their historical pattern, they're likely to continue with scissors for multiple rounds.\n\n9. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock to win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
