    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock vs Scissors: Lower reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (1 point)\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper has the potential for highest reward (3 points)\n   - Paper only risks losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock and scissors can only win 1 point each\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n\n4. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper has asymmetric payoff (can win 3, lose only 1)\n   - If opponent plays rock (common first move), paper wins big\n   - Even if we lose with paper, the loss is minimal\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Based on the higher potential reward\n   - Based on common first-move psychology\n   - Based on favorable risk-reward ratio\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Their last three moves: rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\n   - They've shown they don't like to repeat losing moves\n   - After my previous scissors wins, they adapted effectively\n   - They've historically countered scissors success with rock\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They likely expect me to stick with scissors after success\n   - They've previously punished scissors repetition with rock\n   - They seem to think multiple steps ahead\n   - They might expect me to predict their rock counter\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If they play rock (likely), paper wins 3 points\n   - If they play scissors, rock wins 1 point\n   - If they stay with paper, scissors wins 1 point\n   - Need to continue recovering points\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - Historical pattern suggests they'll counter scissors with rock\n   - They expect me to be predictable after success\n   - Paper would counter their likely rock play\n   - Higher potential reward with paper (3 points)\n\n6. Final reasoning:\n   - Playing paper because:\n   - Counters their likely rock response\n   - Offers highest potential points gain\n   - Breaks expectation of sticking with winning move\n   - Historical pattern suggests they'll use rock to counter scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"

Final reasoning:\n   - Playing paper because:\n   - Their pattern shows preference for rock\n   - They often stick with successful moves\n   - The 3-point potential outweighs the risk\n   - Even if wrong, would still have positive points\n   - Need to counter their comfort move\n   - They've shown consistent return to rock strategy\n   - Breaking their rock momentum is worth the risk\n\n[move] paper\n"
