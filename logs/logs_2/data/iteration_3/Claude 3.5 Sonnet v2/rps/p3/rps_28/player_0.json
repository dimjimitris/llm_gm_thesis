    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent patterns and tendencies\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors have lower rewards (1 point). However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3) if opponent plays scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is a fresh player and the first move, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. In such cases, it's often best to start with a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that paper has both the highest potential reward and highest potential loss, it might be too risky for a first move. We should consider a more balanced option that limits our potential losses while still maintaining winning potential.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock is a solid opening move because:\n1. It beats scissors (1 point)\n2. If opponent plays rock, we tie (0 points)\n3. If opponent plays paper, we lose but not as severely (-3 points)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Rock is a common opening move for many players, which could lead to a tie, and that's better than risking a big loss.\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. Rock provides a balanced risk-reward profile for an opening move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They could either:\n1. Stick with paper since it worked\n2. Anticipate us switching to paper and play scissors\n3. Mix it up completely with rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they won with a high-reward strategy (paper), they might be confident in their aggressive approach. However, sophisticated players often avoid repeating the same move, especially after a successful one, as they expect their opponent to adapt.\n\nRisk Manager: The previous round cost us -3 points. We need to be more strategic but shouldn't become overly reactive. If they're truly aggressive and stick to paper, scissors would give us a +1 point win. If they switch to scissors anticipating our paper, we'd only lose 1 point with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent demonstrated willingness to use paper despite its risk/reward profile. This suggests they might be a bold player who prioritizes higher potential gains.\n\nGame Strategist: Scissors seems like the optimal play here because:\n1. If opponent repeats paper: we win +1\n2. If opponent plays scissors: we tie (0)\n3. If opponent plays rock: we lose -1\nThe worst-case scenario with scissors (-1) is better than the worst-case with other moves.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Scissors offers the best risk-reward balance for this situation. The maximum loss is limited to -1, and we have good winning potential if they repeat paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They have a strong preference for paper\n2. They're setting up a trap, expecting us to go scissors again\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has lost twice playing paper (-3 and -1 points). Traditional game theory suggests they should adapt their strategy after consecutive losses. They might:\n1. Switch to rock to counter our scissors\n2. Try scissors themselves, expecting us to play paper\n3. Stubbornly stick to paper hoping we'll switch\n\nRisk Manager: We're currently at -2 points total (-3 +1). We need to be careful about our next move, but we're also in a position where we can take calculated risks.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Two consecutive paper plays might indicate a beginner's tendency to stick with one move, or it could be a sophisticated player trying to establish a false pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the situation, rock would be a strong play because:\n1. It beats scissors if they're expecting us to repeat our winning move\n2. It ties with rock if they're playing defensively\n3. It only loses to paper, which they might be hesitant to play a third time after two losses\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with rock. It protects against the most likely adaptation (opponent playing scissors) while not risking too much (-3) if we're wrong.

Round 3: Scissors\nThis shows they've finally adapted their strategy, moving away from paper after two losses.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they're capable of changing their strategy, but they're now trailing significantly in points. Their total is -5 points (-3, -1, -1) while we're at 0 (-3, +1, +1). This might make them more aggressive in trying to catch up.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their point deficit, they might be more likely to go for paper plays, as it offers the highest potential gain (+3). We should consider this increased likelihood of risky play from our opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent's switch to scissors last round was punished. Players often don't immediately return to a failed strategy, so scissors is less likely. They might:\n1. Try paper again for high rewards\n2. Play rock to break any patterns we might have detected\n3. Stubbornly return to scissors hoping we don't repeat rock\n\nGame Strategist: Paper would be a strong play here because:\n1. It beats rock if they're playing defensively\n2. It ties with paper if they go for high reward\n3. Only loses 1 point to scissors, which they just lost with\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with paper. Even though it has the highest potential loss, the opponent's recent scissors loss makes that move less likely.

Scissors (them) vs Paper (us) = we lost\nThey've now played scissors twice in a row, after playing paper twice initially.\n\nGame Strategist: This is getting interesting.

Adapt their strategy based on outcomes\n\nRisk Manager: Our total score is now -1 (-3, +1, +1, -1). The opponent has -6 (-3, -1, -1, +1). Despite our recent loss, we're still in a better position, so we don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent's back-to-back scissors plays suggest they might:\n1.

Is now down significantly in points (they're at -7, we're at 0)\n\nRisk Manager: We've recovered to a neutral score (0 points total: -3, +1, +1, -1, +1).

However, this is exactly when we need to be most careful - the opponent has nothing to lose and might make an unexpected move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Four consecutive scissors losses defies normal strategic logic.

A player who might not fully understand the game's scoring\n\nGame Strategist: Despite the strong temptation to play rock again, this might be the perfect time to switch to paper because:\n1.

Need to balance pattern recognition with trap awareness\n\nPattern Analyzer: This scissors sequence could mean:\n1. Partial reversion to their earlier scissors pattern\n2. Attempt to make us expect scissors again\n3. Setting up for a sudden switch to paper\n4. Simple coincidence in competitive play\n\nGame Strategist: Rock remains optimal because:\n1. Just succeeded against their scissors\n2. If they're reverting to patterns, scissors likely continues\n3. Even if they switch to paper, we can afford the loss\n4. Maintains strategic consistency\n\nRisk Manager: Rock offers best risk/reward:\n1. Beats their potential continued scissors\n2. We have momentum with rock\n3. Safe against their potential rock counter\n4. Our lead allows us to maintain consistent strategy\n\nAll personas agree: Stay with rock. While we must remain aware of potential traps, the reappearance of a scissors pattern combined with our recent success with rock suggests maintaining our current strategy. The opponent might be reverting to patterns, but even if they're not, rock provides the best balanced play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
