Recent sequence analysis:\n- After 10 paper streak, opponent played:\n   * rock (won +1 against scissors)\n   * rock (lost -3 to paper)\n- They're showing signs of starting new rock streak\n- Matches their pattern of committed streaks\n\n2. Historical behavior patterns:\n- First streak: 7 papers\n- Second streak: 5 scissors\n- Third streak: 7 papers\n- Fourth streak: 10 papers\n- Now: 2 rocks\n- Each streak had committed duration\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n- They just lost heavily (-3) to paper\n- But historically they:\n   * Maintain streaks despite losses\n   * Don't break patterns quickly\n   * Show high commitment\n   * Eventually switch at unexpected moments\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n- If they continue rock streak: paper wins (+3)\n- If they switch to scissors: paper loses (-1)\n- If they switch to paper: paper ties (0)\n- Their pattern suggests streak continuation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n- They've shown stronger commitment to streaks than reaction to losses\n- Two rock plays suggests new streak formation\n- While they might switch to scissors to counter paper\n- Their historical behavior favors streak continuation\n\n[move] paper\nI choose paper. Despite just losing -3 to paper, their pattern strongly suggests commitment to building new streaks rather than making tactical switches. Paper maximizes points against expected rock continuation while risking minimal loss (-1) if they switch to scissors.\n"

Historical comparison:\n- Previous streaks:\n   * 7 papers\n   * 5 scissors\n   * 7 papers\n   * 10 papers\n   * Now 3 rocks\n- Each streak maintained through losses\n- Current rock streak following pattern\n\n3.

Risk evaluation:\n- If continue rock (matches pattern): paper wins (+3)\n- If switch to scissors (counter paper): paper loses (-1)\n- If switch to paper (surprise): paper ties (0)\n- Paper has highest reward/risk ratio\n\n5.

Critical pattern break analysis:\n- Opponent finally broke their rock streak after 4 plays\n- They switched to scissors after absorbing -9 points\n- This break came earlier than previous patterns\n- But after significant point loss\n\n2.

While their pattern suggests they might start a new scissors streak, they just succeeded with scissors and might maintain it tactically.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
