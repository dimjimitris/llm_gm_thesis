    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs in different moves\n\nLet's collaborate!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Paper has highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock\n- Rock and scissors have lower reward (1 point) when winning\n- Paper also has lowest risk (-1) when losing to scissors\n- Rock has highest risk (-3) when losing to paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't identify any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, paper appears to be the most balanced choice:\n- Best case: Win 3 points vs rock\n- Worst case: Lose 1 point vs scissors\n- Neutral case: 0 points vs paper\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the risk-reward analysis. Paper offers the best combination of high potential reward and limited downside risk.\n\n[move] paper\nThis move offers the highest potential reward (3 points) while limiting potential losses (-1 points), and counters the common opening move of rock.\n"

They might stick to paper hoping we'll switch to rock\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round. We need to consider that they might be anticipating our next move based on game theory.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the psychology here:\n- Most players don't like to repeat the same move after a tie\n- The opponent might expect us to switch to rock (a common response after losing to or tying with paper)\n- If they're thinking one level deeper, they might stick with paper expecting our rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that sophisticated players often try to be \"one step ahead,\" we should consider what move counters their most likely strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: If they switch to scissors (expecting our paper), we'd be better with rock. If they stick to paper (expecting our rock), we'd be better with scissors. Rock has a worse worst-case scenario (-3 vs paper) compared to scissors (-1 vs rock).\n\nGame Strategist: The scissors play here offers a better risk-reward ratio: potential win of 1 point vs paper, and only -1 point loss vs rock. It's also a natural counter to the previous paper-paper tie.\n\n[move] scissors\nChoosing scissors as it counters paper if opponent repeats, and has a better risk-reward ratio than the alternatives.\n"

They might expect us to be frustrated from losing and try rock (a common response after losing)\n2. They could anticipate us trying to counter their rock with paper\n3. They might switch back to their initial paper strategy\n\nRisk Manager: We've accumulated -1 points so far. Their moves show no clear pattern yet (paper \u2192 rock), which makes prediction challenging. We need a move that balances potential gains with limited downside.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown adaptability and good prediction skills, we should avoid being too predictable. A rock move here would be most expected (as retaliation to their rock), and paper might be too obvious as a counter to their previous rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Sophisticated players often avoid immediate repetition of moves. Since they just played rock, there's a decent chance they'll switch to either paper or scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at potential scenarios:\n- If they play paper: scissors would win (1 point)\n- If they play rock: paper would win (3 points)\n- If they play scissors: rock would win (1 point)\n\nPaper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) with moderate risk (-1 if they play scissors).\n\n[move] paper\nChoosing paper as it offers the best potential reward while countering their previous rock move, and they're unlikely to repeat rock immediately.\n"

However, this could be too simplistic - they might expect us to figure this out.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated high-level thinking throughout the game. They might:\n1.
