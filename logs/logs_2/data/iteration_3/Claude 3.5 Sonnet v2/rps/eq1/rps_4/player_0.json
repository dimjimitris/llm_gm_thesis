    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information about the opponent's tendencies, no single move has an advantage over others. Each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or drawing. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze. However, psychological studies suggest that rock is indeed the most common opening move among new players.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this information, I suggest we counter the most common opening move. Since rock is statistically the most frequent opening move, paper would be our optimal counter-choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with this analysis. Playing paper gives us the best chance to win against a probable rock, while still maintaining a neutral position against scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on statistical tendency of new players choosing rock as their first move.\n"

A more experienced player who knows about the \"rock first\" tendency\n2. A naturally aggressive player who prefers scissors\n3. Pure random choice\n\nGame Strategist: After losing with paper, we need to consider that the opponent might:\n1. Stay with scissors after a win (common winning strategy)\n2. Expect us to switch to rock (to beat their previous scissors) and thus switch to paper\n3. Make a completely new choice\n\nRisk Manager: Given these possibilities, I suggest we play rock for these reasons:\n1. It beats scissors if they repeat their winning move\n2. Even if they switch to paper expecting our rock, we only lose one more point\n3. It's a safe play against a possible random choice\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock. Even if we lose again, we'll gain valuable information about our opponent's strategy pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: Concur with rock.

The tie result gives us a neutral restart to analyze their behavior\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has now played scissors\u2192rock. From game theory perspective, after a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move, hoping opponent will change\n2. Switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n3. Try to counter what they think we'll play next\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options:\n- If we play rock again: Could lead to another tie if they stick to rock\n- If we play paper: Beats rock if they stick, but loses to scissors\n- If we play scissors: Beats paper if they switch, loses to rock if they stick\n\nPattern Analyst: Since they've shown willingness to change moves (scissors\u2192rock), they're likely to switch again after a tie. Many players don't like staying with the same move after a tie.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper here. Here's why:\n1. It beats rock if they stick to their last move\n2.
