    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In a single-shot game with no prior information, each move should theoretically have an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. However, research has shown that in the first move of rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose 'rock' as their initial move. This is often due to rock being perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: While that's interesting, we should also consider that our opponent might be aware of this tendency and could counter it. Paper would beat the most common opening move (rock), but this is not guaranteed.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play paper. It beats the statistically most common opening move (rock), and if we're wrong, we only lose to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I support this decision. Paper is a strategic first move that capitalizes on human psychology while not being overly risky.\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. The potential benefit outweighs the risk in this scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on statistical analysis of common opening moves and risk assessment\n"

Risk Manager\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: Interesting - our opponent also chose paper in the first round. This gives us our first piece of information about their strategy. Players who open with paper often tend to be more strategic thinkers, as they're likely aware of the \"rock as common opening\" pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often try to outsmart each other by thinking one level ahead. The typical thought process might be: \"They might expect me to switch, so maybe I should stay with the same move... but they might expect that too.\"\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider that our opponent might follow one of these common patterns after a tie:\n1. Stick with the same move (paper)\n2. Move to the next move in sequence (scissors)\n3. Make a completely random choice\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they're likely to try to outthink us. The most sophisticated play would be to expect us to change our move and counter our most likely change.\n\nGame Strategist: Since scissors is the natural counter to paper, many players would switch to scissors after a paper tie. Our opponent might anticipate this and choose rock to counter scissors. Therefore, I suggest we play paper again.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with this analysis. Playing paper again has several advantages:\n1. It beats rock (which could counter an expected scissors play)\n2. It ties if opponent also overthinks and sticks with paper\n3. It only loses to scissors, which would be a somewhat straightforward play that a strategic opponent might avoid\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on psychological analysis of post-tie behavior and opponent profiling\n"

After losing, players often shift their strategy significantly. Given that they've played paper\u2192rock, they might be working through the moves in reverse order.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider three key factors:\n1. The opponent has lost and might be more emotional/aggressive\n2. They haven't played scissors yet\n3. They've shown a willingness to change their move each round\n\nPattern Analyst: Players who have lost often feel compelled to \"prove themselves\" with their next move. Scissors is their only unused move, and it's also considered an \"aggressive\" move by many players. There's a high probability they'll choose scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The psychological profile suggests scissors as their likely next move. They might think we'll stay with paper after two successful paper plays.\n\nRisk Manager: A rock play from us would:\n1. Beat the predicted scissors\n2. Be safe against another rock play\n3.

Their sequence has been: paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial insight. The opponent has demonstrated they're quite sophisticated:\n1. They've successfully avoided being predictable\n2. They've shown willingness to return to previously used moves\n3. They've successfully countered our last move\n\nRisk Manager: We've now experienced all outcomes (tie, win, loss). The opponent seems to be playing a well-thought-out strategy rather than random moves. They might be using our own predictability against us.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they've played paper twice successfully, they might be overconfident with that move. However, they might also expect us to finally play scissors to counter their paper trend.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect scissors from us, they might play rock. However, they've also shown a pattern of returning to paper when it's been successful. This creates an interesting dilemma.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the opponent's demonstrated level of strategic thinking, we should avoid the most obvious move (scissors to counter paper). They've shown they can anticipate and counter obvious responses. I suggest we play paper again - it's worked twice for us, and they might expect us to avoid it after just losing.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Playing paper here has multiple strategic advantages:\n1. It breaks the expectation that we'll switch to scissors\n2. It beats rock if they try to counter expected scissors\n3. It has historically been our most successful move in this game\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological element supports this - they might expect us to abandon paper after our loss, making it the unexpected choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on pattern analysis and psychological counter-strategy\n"

The opponent has fallen into a clear alternating pattern. Based on this pattern, they should play paper next. However, they might have realized their pattern and try to break it.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the opponent's perspective:\n1. They've lost twice with rock\n2. They've had success once with paper\n3. They haven't used scissors at all yet\n4. They might have noticed their own alternating pattern\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological pressure is high here - they've lost two rounds with rock, and their pattern has become predictable. This often leads players to make a dramatic change. The fact they haven't used scissors at all makes it an attractive option for them to finally try.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. This is a prime situation for them to finally use scissors:\n1. They need to break their losing streak\n2. They need to break their obvious pattern\n3. Scissors is their unused move\n4. They might expect us to play paper again after our success\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, we should play rock:\n1. It beats the likely scissors play\n2.

Their predictable pattern was broken, but unsuccessfully\n\nRisk Manager: After a player uses scissors and loses, they rarely immediately return to scissors. The most common response after losing with scissors is to play rock, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" defensive move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their overall play, they tend to react to losses by changing their strategy. After their first loss, they went back to paper (which had worked before). After losing with rock again, they tried scissors (a completely new move).\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated behavior of trying to bounce back from losses with \"safe\" or \"proven\" moves, they're likely to return to either:\n1.

They need to break a non-winning streak (loss + tie)\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown they're willing to use the same move twice (scissors), breaking their earlier alternating pattern. However, their scissors play hasn't yielded any wins, making it unlikely they'll try it a third time.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated adaptability and previous responses to non-winning situations, I strongly suspect they'll switch to rock.

Are less likely to play scissors as it feels risky when already behind\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior after losses in this game has been interesting:\n- After losing with rock, they played paper\n- After losing with scissors, they returned to paper\nThis suggests they tend to switch moves after losses rather than stick with the same move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern of switching after losses and their current psychological state, rock is their most likely play because:\n1.

Their return to paper strategy failed\n2. They've lost with both scissors and paper recently\n3. They're showing signs of returning to previous patterns\n4. Their brief momentum is completely gone\n\nRisk Manager: After consecutive losses following a win:\n1. Players often become defensive\n2. They tend to avoid recently failed moves\n3. They might try their least-used recent move\n4. They typically resort to safer options\n\nPattern Analyst: Their pattern shows:\n1. Paper has failed multiple times recently\n2. They haven't used rock in several rounds\n3. They're likely to avoid paper after consecutive losses with it\n4. They might return to rock as a defensive move\n\nGame Strategist: Given their situation, they're most likely to:\n1. Play rock as a defensive move\n2. Avoid paper (just lost with it twice)\n3. Try to break their new losing streak\n4. Make a conservative rather than aggressive choice\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend we play paper:\n1. It beats their likely rock play\n2. They're likely to play defensively after consecutive losses\n3. Rock is their least recently used move\n4. We're in a strong position to predict their defensive strategy\n\nAll personas agree: Paper is our optimal play because:\n- It counters their probable defensive rock strategy\n- It takes advantage of their likely return to conservative play\n- It's strong against their most probable move\n- It maintains our strategic momentum\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on opponent's likely defensive strategy after consecutive losses\n"
