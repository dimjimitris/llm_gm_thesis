The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent likely knows that scissors is the standard response here\n3. They might:\n   - Play rock themselves to counter the expected scissors\n   - Stick with paper hoping I'll make the obvious scissors play\n   - Make the obvious scissors play thinking I'll stick with paper\n4. By choosing rock, I'm:\n   - Avoiding the most predictable move (scissors)\n   - Protected against scissors if they make that obvious choice\n   - Taking a calculated risk against paper if they stick with it\n5. This game has shown that success often comes from making less obvious choices while maintaining strategic logic\n6. Breaking the tie pattern is crucial, and sometimes that means making a counter-intuitive play\n\nThis move aims to disrupt the synchronization while maintaining a strategic foundation.\n"
