    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the classic strategies:\n   - Rock is a common opening move for many players as it feels \"strong\"\n   - Paper is less common as a first move\n   - Scissors is moderately common as a first move\n\n3. Without any prior information, I should consider:\n   - The equal probability distribution (1/3 for each move)\n   - The psychological aspect of first moves\n   - The need to start with a balanced approach\n\n4. Given that:\n   - Rock is psychologically appealing as a first move\n   - Many players tend to open with rock\n   - Paper would beat the most common opening move\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Playing paper would be advantageous if opponent plays rock\n   - It's a calculated risk based on common player psychology\n   - Even if wrong, it provides information for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analysis of previous round:\n   - I won by playing paper against rock\n   - My prediction about players often starting with rock was correct\n   - The opponent now knows they lost to paper\n\n2. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing to paper, many players will want to counter it\n   - The natural counter to paper is scissors\n   - The opponent might expect me to stick with my winning move\n\n3. Strategic options:\n   - Keep playing paper (predictable, likely to lose)\n   - Switch to scissors (neutral choice)\n   - Switch to rock (would beat their likely scissors play)\n\n4. Reasoning:\n   - The opponent is likely to switch to scissors to beat my previous paper\n   - If they're thinking strategically, that's their most logical move\n   - Rock would be the best counter to their probable scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors \u2192 my rock wins\n   - If they stick to rock \u2192 it's a tie\n   - If they play paper \u2192 I lose\n   - The most probable scenario favors rock\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
