    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable as initial plays because:\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock but loses to scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper but loses to rock\n\n3. Without any historical data, each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n4. In many cases, rock is a common first move for human players because:\n   - It's perceived as \"strong\"\n   - It's often the first option people think of\n   - It's mentioned first in the game's name\n\n5. Given this psychological factor, I could:\n   - Play paper to beat an expected rock\n   - However, this might be too predictable if the opponent is thinking the same way\n\n6. I'll choose paper for this first round:\n   - It can beat the commonly chosen rock\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I learn they might be more strategic\n   - If opponent plays paper, I learn they might think similarly\n\n[move] paper\n"

Considering opponent's likely psychology:\n   - They lost to paper, so they're likely to avoid rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper again since it worked\n   - Most players tend to change their move after losing\n\n3. Predicting opponent's likely moves:\n   - High chance they'll switch to scissors to counter my previous paper\n   - Lower chance they'll stick with rock (less common after losing)\n   - Medium chance they'll choose paper (to copy my winning move)\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - If I play paper again: risky as they likely expect it\n   - If I play scissors: could lose to rock if they're unconventional\n   - If I play rock: would beat their likely scissors play\n\n5.
