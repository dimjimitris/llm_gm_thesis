    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest points (3)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives 1 point\n   - Scissors beating paper gives 1 point\n   - Losing to paper is most costly (-3)\n\n3. Given this is the first move:\n   - I should avoid high-risk moves that could result in -3 points\n   - Rock is relatively safe as it can only lose to paper (-3) but can win against scissors (+1)\n   - Paper can win big (+3) but can lose to scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors can only win small (+1) and can lose big to rock (-1)\n\n4. Strategy for first move:\n   - Without any information about opponent's patterns\n   - Want to balance potential gain vs loss\n   - Paper offers highest upside but moderate risk\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as first move as it feels \"strong\"\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given these factors, I'll choose paper\n   - This could win big if opponent chooses rock\n   - Even if I lose to scissors, the penalty is minimal (-1)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing last round:\n   - Opponent chose paper\n   - This reveals they might be using similar strategic thinking to mine\n   - They were also willing to take a calculated risk for higher reward\n\n2. Psychology for second round:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper)\n   - They might switch to rock to counter expected scissors\n\n3. Analyzing possible opponent moves:\n   - If they stick with paper: scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock would win (+1)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Opponent likely knows I might switch to scissors\n   - This makes rock an attractive option for them\n   - Therefore, paper could be highly effective\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Going with paper again\n   - If they switch to rock as predicted, I get maximum points (+3)\n   - If they stick with paper, it's another tie (0)\n   - Even if they predict this and use scissors, loss is minimal (-1)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: lost to paper \u2192 tie scissors \u2192 won with rock \u2192 won with scissors\n   - Just won by correctly predicting their paper\n   - Our game has evolved into higher-level strategy\n   - Both players showing ability to predict and counter\n   - They've moved away from their earlier predictable patterns\n\n2. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They just lost to scissors\n   - Their paper play was correctly anticipated\n   - They might feel their moves are becoming readable\n   - Likely to avoid paper after losing to scissors\n   - May try to be less predictable\n\n3. Strategic layering:\n   - They know I just succeeded with scissors\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors\n   - Rock would be their logical counter to expected scissors\n   - They might think I'll anticipate this and use paper\n   - Multiple levels of mind games in play\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors: risky against expected rock\n   - Paper: strong against expected rock, but obvious\n   - Rock: safe against scissors, loses to paper\n   - Need to balance between obvious counter and overthinking\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They're most likely to play rock to beat expected scissors\n   - Paper would be optimal against their probable rock\n   - Even if they double-think to paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - Paper gives highest potential gain (+3)\n   - Worth the calculated risk for higher reward\n\n[move] paper\n"
