Game theory insight:\n   * In a truly random game, long losing streaks are possible\n   * But they should balance out over time\n   * The consistent losses suggest something else\n   * Perhaps I'm being too predictable in my unpredictability\n\n4. Fresh perspective:\n   * What would be the most unexpected move?\n   * Not based on patterns or counter-patterns\n   * Not based on psychology or strategy\n   * But based on breaking my own tendencies\n\n5.
