I won with paper against rock as predicted, bringing my score to 19 points.\n\nRecent sequence:\n- We tied with scissors\n- I won with paper vs their rock\n\nAfter losing to paper, and given the recent pattern of scissors followed by rock, they might:\n1. Use scissors to beat my successful paper play\n2. Stay with rock thinking I might get overconfident and use paper again\n3. Switch to paper anticipating I might use rock to counter their expected scissors\n\nThis is another situation where I've just won with paper, which has often led to opponents using scissors as a counter. Given this recurring pattern and that they've just lost to paper, they're most likely to counter with scissors. Therefore, I'll choose:\n\n[move] rock\n"
