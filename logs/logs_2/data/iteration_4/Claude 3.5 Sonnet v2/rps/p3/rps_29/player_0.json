    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential outcomes and their payoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats rock (highest reward: +3)\n- Rock beats scissors (+1)\n- Scissors beats paper (+1)\n- Ties give 0 points\n\nPsychology Expert: With no prior information about the opponent, they might default to the most common opening move. Studies show that rock is often chosen as the first move by many players, as it represents strength and stability.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the payoffs:\n- If we choose paper and they choose rock: +3 points\n- If we choose paper and they choose scissors: -1 points\n- If we choose paper and they choose paper: 0 points\nThe expected value for paper seems favorable if we assume rock is a common first move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Playing paper as our first move gives us the highest potential gain (+3) while limiting our potential loss (-1).\n\nPsychology Expert: Concurring with this analysis. Paper is a strategic first move that capitalizes on the psychological tendency of players to choose rock first.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward ratio for paper is optimal here. Even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point, but if we're right, we gain 3 points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on game theory analysis and the tendency of players to choose rock as their first move, I choose paper which offers the best risk-reward ratio.\n"

Now we need to consider what they might do next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing to paper with rock, players often exhibit one of two behavioral patterns:\n1. They might stick to rock, thinking we wouldn't expect them to use the same move after losing\n2. More likely, they might try to counter our previous winning move (paper) by playing scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze potential scenarios based on our opponent's likely psychology:\n- If they choose scissors (highly likely to counter our paper): we should play rock\n- If they stick to rock (less likely): we should play paper again\n- If they try paper (least likely as it's a complete strategy shift): rock would lose badly\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent lost significantly (-3 points) to our paper. They are likely to adapt their strategy rather than repeat their losing move. Scissors would be their most logical counter to our previous paper play.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. The -3 point loss creates a strong psychological incentive to counter our paper. Human players often follow a simple pattern of \"counter what beat me last time.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Playing rock here is our safest bet:\n- Beats scissors (likely move): +1 point\n- Loses to paper (unlikely move): -3 points\n- Ties with rock (somewhat unlikely): 0 points\nGiven the high probability they'll play scissors, rock is our optimal choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Given our opponent's previous loss to paper, they're likely to counter with scissors, making rock our optimal defensive and potentially winning move.\n"

They've shown they're capable of higher-level strategic thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting development. The opponent appears to be thinking two steps ahead. They might have anticipated that we would expect them to counter our paper with scissors, hence our rock move, so they played paper instead. This suggests they're a sophisticated player.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's review our current situation:\nRound 1: We played paper, they played rock (we won +3)\nRound 2: We played rock, they played paper (we lost -3)\nNet score: 0 points\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated an escalating level of strategic depth.

After a tie, players often:\n1. Switch to a new move, thinking their opponent will repeat\n2. Stick with the same move, thinking their opponent will switch\nIn this case, since scissors is the lowest-value move, there's a higher probability they'll switch to try for a better payoff.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the current situation:\n- Both players have shown adaptability\n- No player has a point advantage\n- The previous tie with scissors might push both players to seek higher-value plays\n- Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-1)\n- Rock offers moderate reward (+1) but highest potential loss (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: Given that scissors has the lowest payoff structure, and we just tied with it, there's a strong incentive for both players to move away from scissors. The opponent might be thinking about going for the high-reward paper play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. After a tie with a low-value move, players often shift toward higher-value strategies. However, they might also anticipate that we're thinking this and try to counter it.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we think they're moving away from scissors to either rock or paper:\n- Rock would be risky as it loses badly to paper (-3)\n- Paper would lose to scissors (-1) but win big against rock (+3)\n- Scissors would win against paper (+1) but lose to rock (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, staying with scissors provides a balanced approach. It protects against paper while only risking a small loss to rock, and the opponent might overthink and avoid rock expecting us to switch.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors While both players might be tempted to switch to higher-value moves, maintaining scissors provides a balanced risk-reward profile and protects against potential overthinking by our opponent.\n"

They've also just succeeded with rock, which might influence their next decision in two ways:\n1. They might stick with rock after its success\n2. They might expect us to counter rock with paper, and thus switch to scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the recent pattern:\n- They've used rock twice successfully\n- They haven't used scissors offensively yet (only in the tie)\n- They've shown they can anticipate our defensive moves\n- Our recent scissors strategy has failed twice\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent seems to be playing one step ahead of us consistently. If we try to directly counter their last move (rock) with paper, they might be expecting that. However, if we try to think two steps ahead and play scissors, we've already seen that fail.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a key psychological moment. After two successive wins, players often become more confident and might be more likely to make aggressive plays. Also, they haven't used scissors offensively yet, which might make it an attractive option for them now.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- Paper: High risk (-1 vs scissors), high reward (+3 vs rock)\n- Rock: Moderate risk (-3 vs paper), moderate reward (+1 vs scissors)\n- Scissors: Currently showing poor results against this opponent\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern of anticipating our moves and their recent success, they might expect us to avoid scissors after our losses.

This suggests rock might be our best play - it protects against an aggressive scissors play while only risking paper, which they've only used once.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After our recent losses with scissors and the opponent's demonstrated ability to anticipate our moves, we'll play rock to protect against a potential scissors play while accepting the risk of paper.\n"

They've used paper successfully twice, which might make them hesitant to use it a third time as they might think it's becoming predictable. However, that could also be what they want us to think.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their dominance, they might:\n1.

It shows they're also trying to counter the paper trend\n2. They might be getting frustrated with inability to secure a win this round\n3. After two ties with the same move, there's usually a strong psychological pressure to change moves\n4.

Here's why:\n1. It counters the most logical move (rock) that counters our recent scissors pattern\n2. It offers the highest potential reward to help recover our position\n3.

Their most logical response would be scissors to counter our successful paper play.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.
