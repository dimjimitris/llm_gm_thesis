    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has highest payoff (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors has lower payoff (1 point)\n   - Scissors beating paper has lower payoff (1 point)\n\n3. Since paper has potential for highest reward:\n   - If I play paper and win, I get 3 points\n   - If I lose with paper (against scissors), I only lose 1 point\n   - This makes paper an attractive risk/reward option\n\n4. Initial rounds often see players choosing rock as it feels \"safe\"\n   - This makes paper potentially more valuable\n\n5. Given these factors, I'll choose paper for:\n   - Highest potential payoff\n   - Good counter to common first-move rock\n   - Acceptable loss risk\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing last round:\n   - I won with paper against rock\n   - This suggests the opponent might be a \"rock-first\" player\n   - They lost 3 points, which is significant\n\n2. Considering opponent psychology:\n   - After a big loss, players often change their strategy\n   - They might expect me to play paper again\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter expected paper\n\n3. Looking at possible counter-strategies:\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they stay with rock, paper would win again\n   - If they choose paper, rock would lose badly\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock:\n     * Beats scissors (1 point)\n     * Loses to paper (-3 points)\n     * Ties with rock (0 points)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given the psychological pressure of their previous loss\n   - And the likelihood they'll try to counter paper\n   - Rock seems the safest play to counter expected scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"
