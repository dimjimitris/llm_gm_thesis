    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Skilled at identifying patterns and predicting behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: In a first-round game against a fresh player with no prior history, we should consider the payoff structure. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first round with a fresh player, we have no pattern data to work with. We're in a situation of complete uncertainty regarding the opponent's strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, I suggest we take a balanced approach. While paper offers the highest reward, it's also the riskiest move. In situations of uncertainty, it's often better to start with a moderate risk-reward position.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock is a solid opening move because:\n1. It protects against scissors\n2. The penalty against paper (-3) is less common since many players avoid paper as an opening move due to its high risk\n3. If opponent also chooses rock, we get a neutral outcome (0)\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. We can then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's first move in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This could indicate either:\n1. A generally aggressive playing style\n2. A strategic one-time opening move\n3. Random choice\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent successfully used paper in the first round, they might:\n1. Feel confident and stick with paper\n2. Expect us to switch to paper and thus play scissors\n3. Expect us to play scissors (countering their previous paper) and thus play rock\n\nRisk Manager: Since they played the high-risk paper strategy once and succeeded, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Stick with what worked (paper again)\n2. Avoid being predictable and switch\n\nPattern Analyst: In this situation, playing scissors would:\n1. Counter if they repeat paper\n2. Tie if they also switch to scissors\n3. Lose if they predict this and play rock\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent demonstrated willingness to take risks with paper. If they expect us to counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock. However, scissors is still our best statistical play here as it:\n1. Counters the possibility of a repeated paper play\n2. Limits our potential loss to -1 (versus rock) instead of -3 (versus paper)\n3. Could gain us 1 point if they play paper again\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Scissors presents the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Round 2: Rock (defensive, countered our scissors)\nThey seem to be able to anticipate our moves and adapt accordingly.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent appears to be playing strategically rather than randomly. They've used:\n1. Paper to counter our initial rock\n2. Rock to counter our scissors\nThis suggests they're thinking one step ahead of us.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our current situation:\n1. We've lost twice but minimized damage in the second round (-3, then -1)\n2. The opponent might expect us to play paper to counter their rock\n3. However, they've shown they're good at predicting our logical next move\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent might expect this thought process:\n1. They played rock last round\n2. Therefore we might play paper to counter\n3. So they might play scissors to counter our paper\n\nGame Theorist: In this case, we need to break the pattern of being predictable. Instead of playing paper (which would be the obvious counter to their last move), we should play rock because:\n1. It would counter if they play scissors (expecting us to play paper)\n2. It would tie if they also try to break the pattern with rock\n3. We only risk -3 if they predict this and play paper\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.
