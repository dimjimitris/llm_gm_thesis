Since this is a fresh opponent and I don't have any prior information about their playing patterns, I'll start with a balanced approach.\n\nRock is a common opening move for many players as it feels \"strong,\" but that might make paper a good counter. Scissors is slightly riskier due to the lower point reward. Given the asymmetric scoring (paper wins give 3 points while rock and scissors wins only give 1 point), paper has the highest potential upside.\n\n[move] paper I choose paper for my first move, considering its higher potential point reward and that rock is a common opening choice.\n"
