This is the first round against a new player\n   - No prior history to base decisions on\n   - Need to consider the payoff structure\n\n2.

Strategy considerations:\n   - Without knowledge of opponent's tendencies, best to aim for highest potential reward\n   - Paper gives chance for highest reward (3 points vs rock)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Risk vs Reward:\n   - Paper offers best risk-reward ratio\n   - Maximum potential gain of 3 points\n   - Maximum potential loss of only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as it offers the best potential reward while limiting potential losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They finally broke their rock streak\n   - Switched to scissors as predicted\n   - Lost again, but with smaller point loss\n   - They're currently in a losing streak\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They're likely frustrated after multiple losses\n   - Their strategies have been successfully read\n   - They need to break their losing streak\n   - They know I've predicted their last two moves\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n     * Play paper to beat my successful rock\n     * Play rock to counter expected paper\n     * Return to scissors hoping I overthink\n   - Their history shows:\n     * They adapt after losses\n     * They avoid predictable moves\n     * They try to think ahead\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - I've been successful with both paper and rock\n   - They know I successfully predicted scissors\n   - They need to break the pattern\n   - They might expect me to stay with winning rock\n\nFinal decision: Since they've been successfully predicted twice and need to break their losing streak, they're most likely to play paper to beat my successful rock play. I'll play scissors to counter this expected paper play. While risky, their pattern of adapting after losses and need to change strategy makes paper their most logical move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Recent sequence:\n     * Rock (lost to paper, -3)\n     * Rock (lost to paper, -3)\n     * Scissors (lost to rock, -1)\n     * Scissors (tie)\n   - Current total: +3 points\n   - Their last two moves: rock \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've switched from rock to scissors\n   - Matched my scissors instead of playing paper\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable\n   - Breaking away from maintained streaks\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They stopped their losing streak with a tie\n   - They might be regaining confidence\n   - They successfully avoided another loss\n   - They might be establishing new pattern\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - After scissors tie, they might:\n     * Maintain scissors (like previous streaks)\n     * Switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n     * Switch to paper (expecting my rock counter)\n   - Consider their history:\n     * They've shown ability to maintain moves\n     * But also adapt when predicted\n     * Currently more unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - I'm ahead in points (+3)\n   - Can afford to be more conservative\n   - They're likely trying to recover points\n   - Need to protect point lead\n\nFinal decision: Since they've become more unpredictable and matched my scissors (rather than losing with paper), I'll play rock. This beats scissors if they maintain it, and ties with rock if they try to counter scissors. While vulnerable to paper, their recent moves suggest they're more likely to either maintain scissors or play rock to counter scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
