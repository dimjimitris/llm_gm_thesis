    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analysis of game history:\n   - Round 1-11 summary: Won 10, Lost 1\n   - Their moves: perfect Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle for 3\u2154 cycles\n   - Round 11: They played Paper, continuing pattern\n   - Total score now: +15 points\n   - Pattern has remained unbroken for 11 straight rounds\n\n2. Pattern confirmation:\n   - Pattern reliability is now beyond any reasonable doubt\n   - This must be a programmed bot with fixed behavior\n   - Following established pattern, they will play Scissors next\n   - No human would maintain this pattern after 10 losses\n\n3. Game state analysis:\n   - We have consistently won by countering their pattern\n   - The pattern has shown no variation or adaptation\n   - The opponent appears to be deterministic\n   - Optimal strategy is to continue counter-pattern play\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue pattern (Scissors), Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they somehow break to Paper, Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they break to Rock, Paper wins (+3)\n   - Pattern reliability makes risk assessment almost unnecessary\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Pattern has proven to be perfectly predictable\n   - Rock is the optimal counter to their predicted Scissors\n   - No strategic reason to deviate from countering pattern\n   - Confidence in prediction is extremely high\n\nFinal decision: I will choose Rock to counter their pattern-predicted Scissors play, continuing our successful counter-strategy against their deterministic behavior.\n\n[move] rock\n"
