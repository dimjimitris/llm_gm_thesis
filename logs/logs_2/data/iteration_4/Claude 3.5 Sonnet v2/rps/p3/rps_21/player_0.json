    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their tendencies. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while only risking a small penalty (-1 points) if it loses to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we indeed have no pattern to analyze. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the Game Strategist's analysis. Paper offers an asymmetric payoff - high reward potential (3 points) with limited downside risk (-1 points). Even if we're wrong, we minimize our potential losses.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the collective analysis, paper appears to be the optimal first move. It capitalizes on potential high rewards while limiting downside risk, and counters a common opening strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio in this opening move, with potential for high reward (3 points) while limiting potential losses (-1 points).\n"

They have a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might be likely to stick with a move that \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n3. They might anticipate us sticking with paper and switch to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The previous tie means both players were thinking similarly. In game theory, when players show similar strategic thinking, we need to consider what they think we'll do next. The opponent might expect us to either:\n- Stay with paper (as it didn't lose)\n- Switch to scissors (to beat their potential paper)\n- Switch to rock (to completely mix it up)\n\nRisk Manager: Given that scissors has a lower risk (-1 if it loses to rock) compared to paper (-3 if it loses to rock), and that it would beat our opponent if they stick with paper, scissors might be the optimal play here. The risk-reward ratio is favorable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent showing similar strategic thinking in round 1 suggests they might stick with paper, making scissors an attractive option with limited downside risk.\n\nGame Strategist: Scissors also protects us against the most obvious counter to our previous paper play, while maintaining a reasonable position against other possibilities.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on the opponent's first move of paper and the favorable risk-reward ratio, we're choosing scissors which would win against paper while limiting potential losses.\n"

Round 1: paper\n2. Round 2: rock\nThis suggests they might be systematically cycling through moves in a strategic way. Following this pattern, they might choose scissors next.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated play. They anticipated our scissors move in round 2, possibly predicting we would try to counter their paper play. They're thinking at least one step ahead. However, if they are indeed cycling through moves, or if they're trying to stay one step ahead of us, we need to counter their next likely move.\n\nRisk Manager: If Pattern Analyzer is correct and they choose scissors next, rock would be our best play. Rock has a better risk-reward profile in this situation:\n- Beats scissors (+1 points)\n- Only loses to paper (-3 points)\nGiven that we've seen them use paper and rock already, scissors might be more likely than another paper play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the rock play. It also protects us against the possibility that they might stick with rock, which was successful for them last round.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown they're capable of reading our strategy. Rock gives us the best chance against their most likely moves (scissors or rock), while accepting the calculated risk against paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's pattern and strategic play so far, we're choosing rock to counter their potential scissors play or rock repetition.\n"

If they continue this pattern, they would return to paper next.\n\nGame Strategist: The pattern seems too clear, which makes me cautious. A strategic player might:\n1. Continue the pattern, expecting us not to believe they would be so predictable\n2. Break the pattern, expecting us to predict paper\n3. Stick with scissors after losing, trying to recover\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options:\n- If we play scissors: Win vs paper (+1), Lose vs rock (-1)\n- If we play rock: Win vs scissors (+1), Lose vs paper (-3)\n- If we play paper: Win vs rock (+3), Lose vs scissors (-1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: We've had success by reading their pattern, and they haven't shown any indication of breaking it yet. However, the very clarity of the pattern might be a trap.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we just won with rock, they might expect us to stick with our winning move.

Round 4: opponent played paper (they lost)\nThis confirms they're sticking to the paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper pattern, even after losses. This is a strong indication of a systematic player who commits to their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has maintained their cycle despite losing the last two rounds. This suggests either:\n1. They're extremely committed to their strategy\n2. They believe we won't expect them to continue such an obvious pattern\n3. They might finally break the pattern after two consecutive losses\n\nRisk Manager: Following the established pattern, they should play rock next. Our options:\n- Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n- Rock ties with rock (0/0)\n- Scissors loses to rock (-1/+1)\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they've stuck to their pattern even after losses makes it more likely they'll continue it. However, two consecutive losses might finally trigger a pattern break.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure of two losses might influence them to break the pattern, but their strict adherence so far suggests a disciplined player who sticks to their strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper gives us the highest potential reward (+3) and would be the optimal play against their pattern. Given their consistent behavior, the risk of them breaking the pattern seems lower than the potential reward of following our read.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Given the opponent's strong commitment to their pattern despite losses, we're playing paper to counter their expected rock move, with the potential for maximum points.\n"

According to the pattern, they should play scissors next.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. The opponent has:\n- Stuck to their pattern through 5 rounds\n- Lost the last three rounds\n- Lost significantly in points\nThis level of commitment to a losing strategy is remarkable, but three consecutive losses creates immense pressure to change strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: If they stick to pattern (scissors), rock gives us:\n- Best potential outcome (+1 if they play scissors)\n- Acceptable risk (-3 if they finally break pattern to paper)\n- Safe against rock if they repeat last move (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure is at its peak. Three consecutive losses, including a major loss in the last round (-3 points), makes this the most likely point for pattern break. However, their extraordinary commitment to the pattern so far cannot be ignored.\n\nGame Strategist: Even if they break pattern, they're most likely to choose either:\n1.
