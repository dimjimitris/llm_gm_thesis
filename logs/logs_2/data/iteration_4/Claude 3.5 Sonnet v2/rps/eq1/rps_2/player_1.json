    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Consider the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock \n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Each win gives +1 point\n   - Each loss gives -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Without any prior information about the opponent's tendencies:\n   - All three moves are equally viable\n   - The opponent has no reason to favor any particular move\n   - Game theory suggests a random choice is optimal\n\n4. First-time players often choose rock as their initial move because:\n   - Rock is psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - It's commonly the first word in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n   - Studies show rock is slightly more common as a first move\n\n5. Given this reasoning, I'll choose paper to counter the possible rock bias.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - I won by playing paper against rock\n   - My prediction about first-time players favoring rock was correct\n   - The opponent now knows they lost to paper\n\n2. Psychology of the next move:\n   - After losing to paper, players often:\n      a) Switch to scissors to beat the previous winning move\n      b) Stick to their previous move hoping the opponent changes\n      c) Switch to paper themselves\n\n3. The most logical response from the opponent would be scissors to counter my previous paper\n\n4. Given this reasoning:\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they stick to rock, rock would tie\n   - If they switch to paper, rock would lose\n\n5. Weighing the probabilities:\n   - The strongest psychological tendency is to counter the move that just beat you\n   - Therefore, scissors is most likely their next move\n   - Rock would be my best defense against this\n\n[move] rock\n"
