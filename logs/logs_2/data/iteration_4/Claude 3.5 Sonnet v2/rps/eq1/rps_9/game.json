Jump to scissors, anticipating I might use paper\n\nI'm choosing paper because after our previous long sequence of ties was broken, we seem to be settling back into a more stable pattern. Rock is a psychologically \"strong\" position that players often stick with, especially after ties. Additionally, if they try to think ahead, they might expect me to stick with rock to maintain the tie pattern we're potentially rebuilding. While this is vulnerable to scissors, making such an aggressive move after a rock tie would be a bold departure from the measured, matching play we've been seeing.\n"
