    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Statistical Analyst - For probability-based decision making\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when facing uncertainty, it's often best to use a mixed strategy approach.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move and we have no information about the opponent, they might lean towards common first-move tendencies. Studies show that \"rock\" is often a popular first choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nStatistical Analyst: According to various studies, in the first round of RPS:\n- Rock is chosen ~35% of the time\n- Paper ~35% of the time\n- Scissors ~30% of the time\nHowever, given the psychological insight about rock being a common first move, paper might be slightly advantageous.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, paper would be a reasonable choice. It beats rock if they choose the common first move, and ties with paper if they play similarly to our strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with playing paper. Even if we're wrong, the downside is limited to -1 point, and the psychological advantage of potentially winning the first round could influence future gameplay.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After losing with rock, the opponent might:\n1. Switch to paper to counter our previous winning move\n2. Stick to rock thinking we might expect them to switch\n3. Choose scissors as it's the remaining option\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown a conventional opening with rock. After a loss, players often tend to switch their move rather than repeat the same losing move. Given that we won with paper, they might anticipate us using paper again and try to counter it with scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at patterns after a loss:\n- Players switch their move approximately 70% of the time\n- Of those who switch, many tend to choose the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move\n- In this case, scissors would beat our previous paper move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, they're likely to choose scissors to counter our previous paper. Therefore, we should play rock to counter their probable scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the rock choice. If they're thinking one level ahead, they'll choose scissors to beat our previous paper. If they're thinking two levels ahead and expect us to switch to rock, they might choose paper - but this is less likely given this seems to be a more casual game.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent might think: \"They've predicted my moves twice. They might expect me to play rock next to complete the cycle. I'll surprise them with paper instead.\"\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has not yet used paper in any round, which also supports this prediction.

I'll use rock - it's strong and it's what I started with.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. When players feel completely outplayed, they often revert to their initial comfort move. It's a psychological \"reset button.\" The opponent started with rock, and might return to it as a way to \"start over.\"\n\nStatistical Analyst: The cyclic pattern also supports this - they've gone rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper, and the next logical move in their mind might be back to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, if they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to counter their scissors with rock, and thus they might switch to paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their previous pattern-breaking success, they're more likely to continue being unpredictable rather than sticking with scissors. The win might have restored their confidence to think more strategically rather than emotionally.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

However, they might also notice they haven't used rock since their first move.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial psychological moment. After losing with paper twice, they'll likely avoid it. Their successful experience with scissors might make it tempting, but they might also realize we're likely to expect that. Rock has been absent for several rounds and might feel like a \"fresh\" choice to them.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The combination of avoiding recently losing moves (paper) and the long absence of rock makes rock a highly probable choice.

In states of high frustration, players often gravitate towards scissors as it represents an aggressive, \"attacking\" move. It can feel like a way to actively \"cut through\" their losing streak rather than the more passive-feeling rock or paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological analysis aligns with game statistics.

In a state of complete defeat, they might simply choose paper as it's the only move they haven't tried in the last few rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. When players reach this level of defeat, they often resort to the simplest, least aggressive move - paper. It's psychologically the \"easiest\" move to make when you're in a state of learned helplessness, as it doesn't carry the aggressive connotations of scissors or the confrontational nature of rock.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological analysis makes sense. Paper is also the move they've used least recently, and in a state of complete strategic breakdown, players often choose the option they haven't used in a while, simply for the sake of trying something different.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

It's often seen as the \"strongest\" move psychologically, which might appeal to them in this state of total defeat.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. When players reach this level of complete defeat, they often revert to rock as it represents stability and strength - psychological qualities they're desperately lacking after such a crushing series of losses. It's a subconscious attempt to find some sort of solid ground.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological reversion to rock makes the most sense here. They've just lost with paper, their previous scissors attempts failed, and rock represents their original starting point - a natural choice when all other strategies have failed completely.\n\n[move] paper\n"

At this point, they're likely to choose scissors as a form of psychological release. It's the most aggressive move, and after so many losses, they might just want to make a \"cutting\" gesture out of pure frustration. The passive nature of rock just failed them again, making an aggressive response more likely.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The pattern also supports this.

When players reach this level of complete defeat, they often return to their first move (rock) as a psychological anchor. It's like trying to \"start fresh\" or \"go back to the beginning\" when nothing else has worked. Rock also represents stability and strength - qualities they might subconsciously seek after such a crushing series of losses.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological need to avoid their recent paper loss, combined with the tendency to revert to initial strategies in times of extreme stress, makes rock highly probable.

It's their original move, gave them one of their only wins, and feels psychologically \"strongest\" when they're feeling vulnerable.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree. As they slip back into a losing pattern, rock becomes psychologically appealing. It's their \"foundation\" move - the one they started with and one that brought them success. After losing with the passive paper move, they might want something that feels more solid and defensive.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The combination of psychological comfort with rock and the natural tendency to avoid recently failed moves (paper) makes rock highly probable.

It represents both a complete change from their just-failed defensive move and an aggressive response to their mounting losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree completely. After losing with their traditional comfort move (rock), they're likely to swing to the opposite extreme with scissors. It's both an expression of their frustration and a way to actively \"fight back\" against their losing streak. The passive moves (rock, paper) have failed them, so they might feel the need to be aggressive.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The psychological need for an aggressive response after a defensive move failed, combined with their pattern of switching moves after losses, makes scissors highly probable.
