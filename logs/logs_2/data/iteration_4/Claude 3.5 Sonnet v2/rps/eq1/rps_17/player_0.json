    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors without prior information, each move has equal probability of winning:\n   - Rock beats scissors (1/3 chance)\n   - Paper beats rock (1/3 chance)\n   - Scissors beats paper (1/3 chance)\n\n3. Since I have no historical data about my opponent:\n   - I cannot predict their likely move\n   - They cannot predict my likely move\n   - This is effectively a random situation\n\n4. In such scenarios, any move is equally valid as an opening move.\n\n5. However, research suggests that rock is often the most common opening move among players, as it represents strength and stability.\n   - If my opponent plays rock, paper would win\n   - If my opponent plays scissors, rock would win\n   - If my opponent plays paper, paper would tie\n\n6. Given this, I'll choose paper as my opening move, as it:\n   - Beats the most common opening move (rock)\n   - At worst results in a tie (against paper)\n   - Only loses to scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"

I have information from the previous round:\n   - I played paper and won\n   - My opponent played rock\n   - This suggests they might be a traditional/conservative player\n\n2. After losing a round, players often:\n   - Either change their strategy completely\n   - Or try to anticipate their opponent's next move based on previous success\n\n3. Given that I won with paper, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to play paper again (since it worked)\n   - Therefore choose scissors to counter paper\n\n4. Another common psychological pattern is:\n   - Players who lose with rock often switch to paper in the next round\n   - This is because they just lost to paper and might think \"paper is strong\"\n\n5. Considering these factors:\n   - If they expect me to play paper and choose scissors \u2192 I should play rock\n   - If they switch to paper as a response to losing \u2192 I should play scissors\n   - If they stick with rock (less likely) \u2192 paper would win again\n\n6. Given that the most likely scenarios involve them changing their move, and considering the psychological tendency to counter the previous winning move, I'll choose rock to beat their potential scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
