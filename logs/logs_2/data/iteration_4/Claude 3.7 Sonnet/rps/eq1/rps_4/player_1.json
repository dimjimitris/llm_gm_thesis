Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They didn't continue the exact cycle I predicted (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), but instead repeated paper.\n6. This suggests they're not using a simple pattern but are effectively reading and countering my moves.\n7. I need to completely change my approach as my current thinking process is being consistently outplayed.\n8. Their last two moves were rock followed by paper.\n9. If they're trying to establish a pattern to trick me, they might play scissors next.\n10. Alternatively, they might stick with paper since it just worked.\n11. Looking at the full history, paper has been their most successful move against me.\n12. Since they've consistently countered my moves for four straight rounds, I need to stop trying to predict them based on patterns and instead focus on breaking their momentum.\n13. At this point, with their apparent ability to predict me, my best option might be to play completely randomly.\n14.

We've now tied with paper again, making this our eighth tie overall.\n3. Paper has been by far our most common tie move (5 times now).\n4. Looking at their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper\n5. After winning with scissors, they played paper, breaking their previous apparent reverse cycle pattern.\n6. This game has had an unusually high number of ties (8 out of 20 rounds, or 40%).\n7. Given we just tied with paper, there's psychological pressure to change moves.\n8. Throughout our game, after paper ties, they've most commonly played either rock or scissors next.\n9. If they expect me to play scissors (to beat our tied paper), they would likely play rock.\n10. If they expect me to anticipate this and play rock myself, they might play paper again.\n11. Given the frequency of paper ties in our game, they might deliberately avoid paper.\n12. Looking at our longer history, they've shown an ability to anticipate my moves and counter effectively.\n13. After our previous paper tie in round 17, they played rock in round 18, suggesting they might follow a similar pattern.\n14. If I predict they'll play rock (either following their historical pattern after paper ties or countering my anticipated scissors), my best move would be paper.\n15. However, given the high frequency of paper ties and their likely desire to break this pattern, rock seems less probable.\n16. Weighing all factors, I believe they're most likely to play scissors to counter the anticipated paper, making rock my best move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

We've now tied again, this time with rock.\n3. This is our ninth tie overall, which is an extremely high rate (9/21 = 43% ties).\n4. Looking at our recent sequence of ties: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n5. Our recent pattern of moves shows a tendency toward paper and rock, with fewer scissors plays.\n6. Given we just tied with rock, the most straightforward counter would be paper.\n7. However, given our history of frequent ties, playing the obvious counter might lead to another tie.\n8. Throughout our game, we've demonstrated remarkably similar thinking patterns, leading to these frequent ties.\n9. After our previous rock tie in round 18, I played paper and they played scissors (I lost).\n10. This suggests they might anticipate me playing paper again to counter rock.\n11. If they expect me to play paper (to beat our tied rock), they would likely play scissors.\n12. If they expect me to anticipate this and play rock again, they might play paper.\n13. Looking at their overall strategy, they've shown an ability to think multiple steps ahead.\n14. Given the psychological dynamics after so many ties, and their demonstrated ability to counter effectively, scissors seems like their most likely move.\n15. If I predict they'll play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n16. However, playing rock again after a rock tie seems unlikely to succeed.\n17. Another possibility is that they'll play paper, expecting me to stay with rock or play scissors.\n18. Weighing all factors and considering the need to break this tie cycle, scissors seems like my best option - it would beat paper if they play it, and would be unexpected after our recent rock tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We've now tied again, this time with scissors.\n3. This is our tenth tie overall, which is a remarkably high rate (10/22 = 45% ties).\n4. We've now had ties with all three possible moves (paper 5 times, rock 3 times, scissors 2 times).\n5. We've tied in the last three consecutive rounds, with a different move each time: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors.\n6. This suggests we're both using very similar reasoning processes, leading to identical choices.\n7. The pressure to break this tie streak is extremely high for both players.\n8. Given we just tied with scissors, the most straightforward counter would be rock.\n9. However, if we're both thinking alike, we might both play rock, leading to another tie.\n10. In our previous extended tie streaks, we've had difficulty breaking the pattern.\n11. Throughout our game, my opponent has shown they can identify patterns and counter effectively.\n12. If they expect me to play rock (to beat our tied scissors), they would likely play paper.\n13. If they expect me to anticipate this and play scissors again or paper, they might play rock or scissors.\n14. Given the psychological dynamics of extended tie streaks, and our apparent synchronicity in thinking, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n15. Looking at the complete cycle of our recent ties (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), the next logical move would be paper.\n16. However, this might be too obvious a pattern to follow.\n17. Weighing all factors, I believe they're most likely to play paper, expecting me to play rock to counter our scissors tie.\n18.

I just lost with paper against their scissors.\n3. Looking at their recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n4. This follows the standard RPS cycle in reverse order.\n5. If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next.\n6. After winning, they might stick with what just worked (scissors).\n7. Throughout our game, they have occasionally repeated winning moves.\n8. Looking at their historical responses after winning with scissors:\n   - In round 9, they won with scissors, then in round 10 they played paper\n   - In round 19, they won with scissors, then in round 20 they played paper\n9. This suggests they might play paper after winning with scissors.\n10. They may also be trying to anticipate my adjustment after losing to their scissors.\n11. If they think I'll play rock (to counter their scissors), they might play paper.\n12. If they think I'll play scissors (expecting them to play paper), they might play rock.\n13. Given their demonstrated pattern recognition throughout our game, they're likely aware that I might expect them to play paper next (based on both their reverse cycle and historical pattern).\n14. If they expect me to counter their anticipated paper with scissors, they would play rock.\n15. Weighing these possibilities, I think they're most likely to either play paper (following their historical pattern after winning with scissors) or rock (anticipating my adjustment).\n16. Given their success rate and apparent strategic thinking, rock seems more likely.\n17. If I predict they'll play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We've now tied with paper.\n3. This is our twelfth tie overall, maintaining the remarkably high tie rate (12/28 = 43%).\n4. Paper has been our most common tie move (6 times now).\n5. Looking at their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper\n6. After winning with scissors, they played paper, which matches their historical pattern.\n7. Given we just tied with paper, there's psychological pressure to change moves.\n8. Throughout our game, after paper ties, they've most commonly played scissors or rock next.\n9. If they expect me to play scissors (to beat our tied paper), they would likely play rock.\n10. If they expect me to anticipate this and play rock myself, they might play paper again.\n11. Given the frequency of paper ties in our game, they might deliberately avoid paper.\n12. After our previous paper tie in round 20, they played rock in round 21.\n13. After our paper tie in round 17, they also played rock in round 18.\n14. This suggests a pattern where they tend to play rock after paper ties.\n15. If I predict they'll play rock (following their historical pattern after paper ties), my best move would be paper.\n16. However, given this apparent pattern and their demonstrated ability to recognize patterns, they might anticipate this and play scissors instead.\n17. Weighing all factors, I believe scissors is my best move - it would beat paper if they repeat it, and disrupts their potential expectation that I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
