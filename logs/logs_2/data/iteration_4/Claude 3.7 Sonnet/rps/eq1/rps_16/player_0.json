Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given these possibilities, I need to make a strategic choice.\n9. Since many players don't repeat the same move after a tie, scissors would be a good counter to their potential switch to paper.\n10.

My opponent's moves continue to follow the perfect rock-paper-scissors cycle (with just that one exception of a repeated scissors earlier).\n4. Their last twenty-five moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n5. If they continue their established pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n6. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n7. Despite losing twenty-seven consecutive rounds, they have shown remarkable consistency in their pattern.\n8. This strongly suggests they are using a fixed, predetermined sequence regardless of the outcome.\n9. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates they will play scissors next, continuing their cycle.\n10. Therefore, rock would be my optimal choice to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"
