Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing, they switch to a different move about 88% of the time\n   - They've switched to scissors after losing 2 out of 9 times\n   - They've switched to paper after losing 3 out of 9 times\n   - They've switched to rock after losing 4 out of 9 times\n\n6. Given that I've just won with paper and they've lost with rock, they'll likely expect me to play paper again.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, their best move would be scissors.\n\n8. To counter their likely scissors play, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've now won 11 rounds, lost 7, and tied 7.\n\n4. My opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 24 and 25).\n\n5.

Looking at their pattern after wins:\n   - After winning, they've switched to a different move about 75% of the time\n   - They occasionally repeat moves after winning (about 25% of the time)\n\n7. Given that they've now played rock twice in a row and won with it in round 25, they might be confident enough to switch.\n\n8. If they switch after this win, they're most likely to play paper, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their rock streak.\n\n9. To counter their likely paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, I've lost several times playing scissors against their rock. I need to be cautious about this pattern.\n\n11. Weighing all factors, I think they're more likely to switch to paper than to stay with rock for a third consecutive round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their most recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - If they're cycling through options, they might play scissors next\n   - If they're continuing their winning strategy, they might play rock again\n\n6. Looking at their full pattern:\n   - They've now played rock 4 times, paper 3 times, and scissors 3 times\n   - Rock appears to be their most frequent choice\n\n7. After playing rock, they've previously played:\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper (1 time)\n   - And now we're waiting to see what comes after their third rock\n\n8. My opponent seems to be either extremely good at predicting my moves or following a strategy I haven't identified.\n\n9. Given that I've lost with scissors against their rock 3 times now, they might expect me to avoid scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), they might play scissors.\n\n11. If they think I'll play rock (changing completely from my last move), they might play paper.\n\n12. Since rock has been my least played move recently, and my opponent might anticipate me switching away from scissors after losing with it, I'll choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at my opponent's pattern after losing:\n   - After losing in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing in round 10, they played paper\n   - After losing in round 12, they played paper\n   - After just losing in round 16 with paper, what will they play?\n\n7. Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   - If they're cycling through options, they might play rock next\n\n8. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Rock and paper have been equally frequent\n\n9. After they play paper, they've previously played:\n   - Scissors (2 times)\n   - Rock (2 times)\n   - Paper (1 time)\n   - No strong pattern after paper\n\n10. After they lose with paper, they've previously:\n    - Played paper (1 time, after round 8)\n    - Not enough data to establish a strong pattern\n\n11. Given that I just won with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to:\n    - Stick with scissors (my winning move)\n    - Switch to rock (thinking they'll play scissors)\n    - Switch to paper (being unpredictable)\n\n12.

If they expect me to switch to rock, they would play paper.\n    - To counter paper, I would need to play scissors\n\n14. If they expect me to switch to paper, they would play scissors.\n    - To counter scissors, I would need to play rock\n\n15.

However, rock has been their most frequent response after facing scissors (used rock after scissors in 3 out of 4 instances).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at patterns after my losses:\n   - After losing in round 17 (paper vs scissors), I need to make a new decision\n\n6. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - There might be a pattern of alternating paper and scissors in their recent moves\n\n7. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - They've now played each option exactly the same number of times\n\n8. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (3 times)\n   - Rock (1 time)\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper appears more likely after they play scissors\n\n9. After they win with scissors, they've previously:\n   - Played paper (3 times, after rounds 1, 3, and 7)\n   - Played scissors (1 time, after round 15)\n   - Paper is more common, but they just broke this pattern by playing scissors after winning with scissors\n\n10. Looking at what I've played after losing to scissors:\n    - After round 1, I played rock\n    - After round 7, I played rock\n    - After round 15, I played scissors (and won)\n    - I've just lost to scissors in round 17\n\n11. Given their previous pattern of playing paper after winning with scissors (which they broke once), and the possibility they're now alternating between paper and scissors, they might play paper next.\n\n12. However, they might also expect me to anticipate paper and play scissors, in which case they would play rock.\n\n13. Looking at my recent moves, I've played paper twice in the last 3 rounds, so they might expect me to avoid paper now.\n\n14. If they expect me to play rock (to counter their expected scissors), they might play paper.\n\n15. If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their expected paper), they might play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given their history of playing scissors after paper (3 out of 6 times), and their recent alternating pattern, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n11. To counter scissors, rock would be my best move.\n\n12. However, they might also be expecting me to switch away from rock after losing with it, and play paper again.\n\n13. If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors.\n\n14. If they expect me to play scissors, they might play rock.\n\n15. Given that I've lost with rock against their paper 4 times now, they might expect me to avoid rock. But this could also be a good time to play rock if they're going to play scissors next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at my opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After our tie in round 5 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After our tie in round 11 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After our tie in round 14 (both rock), they played scissors\n   - After our tie in round 19 (both rock), they played scissors\n   - After paper-paper ties, they played rock both times\n   - After rock-rock ties, they played scissors both times\n   - After scissors-scissors ties, we have no precedent yet\n\n7. Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - They've played scissors twice in a row, which is unusual for them\n\n8. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n   - Scissors has become their most frequent choice\n\n9. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (3 times)\n   - Rock (2 times)\n   - Scissors (1 time, not counting the one we're analyzing)\n   - Paper appears more likely after they play scissors\n\n10. After a tie with scissors (which we've never had before), typical player psychology suggests:\n    - They might play rock (to beat the scissors they just played)\n    - Or they might play scissors again (thinking I'll switch)\n\n11. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row now, and they rarely repeat the same move three times, they're likely to switch.\n\n12. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors (3 out of 6 times), and the fact that they haven't played paper recently, paper seems like a reasonable prediction.\n\n13. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\n14. However, if they're anticipating this reasoning, they might play rock instead.\n\n15. Given that after our previous ties they've played either rock or scissors (never paper), and scissors has been played twice in a row, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After they lose with scissors, they've previously:\n    - Played rock (1 time, after round 3)\n    - Played paper (1 time, after round 10)\n    - Played scissors (1 time, after round 20)\n    - No strong pattern after losing with scissors\n\n11. My pattern after winning with rock against scissors:\n    - After round 3, I played scissors (lost)\n    - After round 10, I played paper (tied)\n    - After round 20, I played scissors (tied)\n    - After round 25, I need to decide\n\n12. Given that I just won with rock, my opponent might expect me to:\n    - Stick with rock (my winning move)\n    - Switch to paper (based on what I did after round 10)\n    - Switch to scissors (based on what I did after rounds 3 and 20)\n\n13. If they expect me to play rock again, they would play paper.\n    - To counter paper, I would need to play scissors\n\n14. If they expect me to switch to paper, they would play scissors.\n    - To counter scissors, I would need to play rock\n\n15. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they would play rock.\n    - To counter rock, I would need to play paper\n\n16. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors in general (4 out of 8 times), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n17. However, there's no strong pattern after they lose with scissors specifically, and they've played each option (rock, paper, scissors) once after losing with scissors.\n\n18. Given that I've switched to scissors twice after winning with rock (in rounds 3 and 20), they might anticipate this move and play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Scissors has become their most frequent choice\n\n8. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (4 times)\n   - Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors (2 times, not counting the one we're analyzing)\n   - Paper appears most likely after they play scissors\n\n9. After they win with scissors, they've previously:\n   - Played paper (3 times, after rounds 1, 3, and 7)\n   - Played scissors (1 time, after round 15)\n   - Played rock (1 time, after round 17)\n   - Paper appears most likely after they win with scissors\n\n10. After they play scissors twice in a row (which has happened once before):\n    - After rounds 20-21, they played paper\n    - This suggests paper might follow their scissors-scissors sequence\n\n11. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row now, and they rarely play the same move three times in a row, they're likely to switch.\n\n12. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors in general (4 out of 9 times), and particularly after winning with scissors (3 out of 5 times), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n13. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\n14. However, they might also be anticipating this reasoning and play rock instead.\n\n15. Looking at my record against them:\n    - When I play rock: 4 wins, 2 losses, 3 ties\n    - When I play paper: 2 wins, 6 losses, 2 ties\n    - When I play scissors: 1 win, 4 losses, 2 ties\n    - Rock has been my most successful move\n\n16. Given their likely switch from scissors, their history of playing paper after scissors, and my better record with rock, I'll choose scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

To counter rock, paper would be my best move.\n\n14. However, if they continue their recent alternating pattern and play scissors next, paper would lose.\n\n15. Given that I've lost with rock against their paper 3 times now, and with paper against their scissors multiple times, I need to break my own patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
