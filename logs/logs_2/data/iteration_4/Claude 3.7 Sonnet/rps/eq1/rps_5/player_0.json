    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If they play rock again, my best counter is paper.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate that I'll counter their rock with paper, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n10. Weighing these possibilities, I think paper is the safer choice because:\n    - It beats rock if they repeat\n    - If they switch to scissors, I lose, but this requires them to anticipate my adjustment\n    - If they switch to paper, we tie\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After losing with rock (to my paper), they might:\n   a) Switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper)\n   b) Switch to paper (to try something different)\n   c) Stay with rock (unlikely based on their pattern after losses)\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing, they switch to a different move about 88% of the time\n   - They've switched to scissors after losing 2 out of 9 times\n   - They've switched to paper after losing 3 out of 9 times\n   - They've switched to rock after losing 4 out of 9 times\n\n6. Given that I've just won with paper and they've lost with rock, they'll likely expect me to play paper again.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, their best move would be scissors.\n\n8.

My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   My moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now won 11 rounds, lost 6, and tied 7.\n\n4. Looking at how my opponent responds after rock-rock ties:\n   - After our tie in round 14 (both rock), they played paper in round 15\n   - After our tie in round 19 (both rock), they played rock again in round 20\n   - After our tie in round 24 (both rock), their pattern is inconsistent\n\n5. After a tie with both playing rock, they might:\n   a) Switch to paper (to beat the rock we both just played) - they did this after our first rock tie\n   b) Stay with rock (they did this after our second rock tie)\n   c) Switch to scissors (to try something different)\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern after ties, they have varied responses.\n\n7. Given that we've now had several ties in recent rounds, they might be more determined to win.\n\n8. Considering their past behavior after rock-rock ties is split between staying with rock and switching to paper, I need to weigh both possibilities.\n\n9. If they stay with rock, my best play would be paper.\n   If they switch to paper, my best play would be scissors.\n   If they switch to scissors, my best play would be rock.\n\n10. Given that they switched to paper after our first rock-rock tie, and they've shown a pattern of not being too predictable, they're slightly more likely to switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won 11 rounds, lost 7, and tied 7.\n\n4. My opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 24 and 25).\n\n5. After winning with rock (against my scissors), they might:\n   a) Stay with rock (since it worked and they've played it twice in a row)\n   b) Switch to paper (expecting me to play rock)\n   c) Switch to scissors (to try something different)\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after wins:\n   - After winning, they've switched to a different move about 75% of the time\n   - They occasionally repeat moves after winning (about 25% of the time)\n\n7. Given that they've now played rock twice in a row and won with it in round 25, they might be confident enough to switch.\n\n8. If they switch after this win, they're most likely to play paper, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their rock streak.\n\n9. To counter their likely paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, I've lost several times playing scissors against their rock. I need to be cautious about this pattern.\n\n11. Weighing all factors, I think they're more likely to switch to paper than to stay with rock for a third consecutive round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's analyze the complete pattern of moves so far:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 26: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 29: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   My moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now won 14 rounds, lost 8, and tied 7.\n\n4. After losing with rock (to my paper), they might:\n   a) Switch to scissors (to beat my expected paper)\n   b) Switch to paper (to try something different)\n   c) Stay with rock (unlikely based on their pattern after losses)\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing, they've switched to a different move about 90% of the time\n   - They've switched to scissors after losing about 30% of the time\n   - They've switched to paper after losing about 40% of the time\n   - They've stayed with the same move after losing only about 10% of the time\n\n6. Given that I've just won with paper and they've lost with rock, they'll likely expect me to play paper again.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, their best move would be scissors.\n\n8. To counter their likely scissors play, I should play rock.\n\n9. I also need to consider that I've had a pattern of switching between scissors and paper in recent rounds, which they might have noticed.\n\n10. Given their strong tendency to switch after losses and their likely anticipation that I'll play paper again, rock is my best strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
