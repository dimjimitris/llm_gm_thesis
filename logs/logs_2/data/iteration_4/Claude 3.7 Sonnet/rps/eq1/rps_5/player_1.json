Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. My opponent seems to be extremely good at anticipating my moves:\n   - When I play paper, they've played scissors 2 times and paper 1 time (tie)\n   - When I play rock, they've played paper 2 times and scissors 1 time\n   - When I play scissors, they've played rock 3 times\n\n5. Their most recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - If they're cycling through options, they might play scissors next\n   - If they're continuing their winning strategy, they might play rock again\n\n6. Looking at their full pattern:\n   - They've now played rock 4 times, paper 3 times, and scissors 3 times\n   - Rock appears to be their most frequent choice\n\n7. After playing rock, they've previously played:\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper (1 time)\n   - And now we're waiting to see what comes after their third rock\n\n8. My opponent seems to be either extremely good at predicting my moves or following a strategy I haven't identified.\n\n9. Given that I've lost with scissors against their rock 3 times now, they might expect me to avoid scissors.\n\n10. If they think I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), they might play scissors.\n\n11. If they think I'll play rock (changing completely from my last move), they might play paper.\n\n12. Since rock has been my least played move recently, and my opponent might anticipate me switching away from scissors after losing with it, I'll choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing patterns after my wins:\n   - In round 3, I won with rock against scissors, and then switched to scissors (lost)\n   - I just won with rock against scissors in round 10\n\n6. Looking at my opponent's response after losing:\n   - After losing in round 3 (with scissors against my rock), they played rock next\n   - After just losing in round 10 (with scissors against my rock), they might follow a similar pattern\n\n7. Their most recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - There's no clear cycling pattern here\n\n8.

If they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper.\n    - To counter paper, I would need to play scissors\n\n12. If they expect me to play paper (thinking they'll play rock), they might play scissors.\n    - To counter scissors, I would need to play rock\n\n13. Given that I just won with rock, and they previously responded to losing against rock by playing rock, they might play rock now.\n    - To counter rock, I should play paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, they might also expect me to anticipate paper and play scissors, in which case they would play rock.\n\n13. Looking at my recent moves, I've played paper twice in the last 3 rounds, so they might expect me to avoid paper now.\n\n14.

After ties, what has happened:\n   - After our tie in round 5 (both paper), I played scissors and they played rock (I lost)\n   - After our tie in round 11 (both paper), I played paper and they played rock (I won)\n   - After our tie in round 14 (both rock), I played paper and they played scissors (I lost)\n   - After our tie in round 19 (both rock), I played rock and they played scissors (I won)\n   - We just had a tie in round 21 (both scissors)\n\n6. Looking at my opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After our tie in round 5 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After our tie in round 11 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After our tie in round 14 (both rock), they played scissors\n   - After our tie in round 19 (both rock), they played scissors\n   - After paper-paper ties, they played rock both times\n   - After rock-rock ties, they played scissors both times\n   - After scissors-scissors ties, we have no precedent yet\n\n7. Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - They've played scissors twice in a row, which is unusual for them\n\n8. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n   - Scissors has become their most frequent choice\n\n9. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (3 times)\n   - Rock (2 times)\n   - Scissors (1 time, not counting the one we're analyzing)\n   - Paper appears more likely after they play scissors\n\n10. After a tie with scissors (which we've never had before), typical player psychology suggests:\n    - They might play rock (to beat the scissors they just played)\n    - Or they might play scissors again (thinking I'll switch)\n\n11. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row now, and they rarely repeat the same move three times, they're likely to switch.\n\n12. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors (3 out of 6 times), and the fact that they haven't played paper recently, paper seems like a reasonable prediction.\n\n13. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\n14. However, if they're anticipating this reasoning, they might play rock instead.\n\n15. Given that after our previous ties they've played either rock or scissors (never paper), and scissors has been played twice in a row, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at my opponent's pattern after losing with scissors:\n   - After losing in round 3 with scissors, they played rock\n   - After losing in round 10 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After losing in round 20 with scissors, they played scissors\n   - After just losing in round 25 with scissors, what will they play?\n\n7. Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - No clear pattern in this subsequence\n\n8. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 9 times\n   - Rock and scissors have been equally frequent\n\n9. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (4 times)\n   - Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors (1 time)\n   - Paper appears most likely after they play scissors\n\n10. After they lose with scissors, they've previously:\n    - Played rock (1 time, after round 3)\n    - Played paper (1 time, after round 10)\n    - Played scissors (1 time, after round 20)\n    - No strong pattern after losing with scissors\n\n11. My pattern after winning with rock against scissors:\n    - After round 3, I played scissors (lost)\n    - After round 10, I played paper (tied)\n    - After round 20, I played scissors (tied)\n    - After round 25, I need to decide\n\n12. Given that I just won with rock, my opponent might expect me to:\n    - Stick with rock (my winning move)\n    - Switch to paper (based on what I did after round 10)\n    - Switch to scissors (based on what I did after rounds 3 and 20)\n\n13. If they expect me to play rock again, they would play paper.\n    - To counter paper, I would need to play scissors\n\n14. If they expect me to switch to paper, they would play scissors.\n    - To counter scissors, I would need to play rock\n\n15. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they would play rock.\n    - To counter rock, I would need to play paper\n\n16. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors in general (4 out of 8 times), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n17. However, there's no strong pattern after they lose with scissors specifically, and they've played each option (rock, paper, scissors) once after losing with scissors.\n\n18. Given that I've switched to scissors twice after winning with rock (in rounds 3 and 20), they might anticipate this move and play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their most recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - They've played scissors twice in a row\n\n7. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 10 times\n   - Scissors has become their most frequent choice\n\n8. After they play scissors, they've previously played:\n   - Paper (4 times)\n   - Rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors (2 times, not counting the one we're analyzing)\n   - Paper appears most likely after they play scissors\n\n9.

After they play scissors twice in a row (which has happened once before):\n    - After rounds 20-21, they played paper\n    - This suggests paper might follow their scissors-scissors sequence\n\n11. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row now, and they rarely play the same move three times in a row, they're likely to switch.\n\n12. Based on their history of playing paper after scissors in general (4 out of 9 times), and particularly after winning with scissors (3 out of 5 times), paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n13. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\n14. However, they might also be anticipating this reasoning and play rock instead.\n\n15. Looking at my record against them:\n    - When I play rock: 4 wins, 2 losses, 3 ties\n    - When I play paper: 2 wins, 6 losses, 2 ties\n    - When I play scissors: 1 win, 4 losses, 2 ties\n    - Rock has been my most successful move\n\n16. Given their likely switch from scissors, their history of playing paper after scissors, and my better record with rock, I'll choose scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at patterns after my losses with rock against paper:\n   - After losing in round 2 (rock vs paper), I played rock\n   - After losing in round 8 (rock vs paper), I played scissors\n   - After losing in round 13 (rock vs paper), I played rock\n   - After losing in round 18 (rock vs paper), I played rock\n   - After losing in round 29 (rock vs paper), I need to decide\n\n6. Looking at my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their most recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   - There might be a pattern where they alternate between scissors and paper\n\n7. Overall frequencies in their plays:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Paper: 10 times\n   - Scissors: 11 times\n   - Scissors remains their most frequent choice, followed closely by paper\n\n8. After they play paper, they've previously played:\n   - Scissors (3 times)\n   - Rock (5 times)\n   - Paper (1 time)\n   - Rock appears most likely after they play paper\n\n9. After they win with paper, they've previously:\n   - Played scissors (1 time, after round 2)\n   - Played rock (3 times, after rounds 8, 13, and 18)\n   - Rock appears most likely after they win with paper\n\n10. Looking at my success rates against them:\n    - When I play rock: 4 wins, 3 losses, 3 ties\n    - When I play paper: 2 wins, 7 losses, 2 ties\n    - When I play scissors: 2 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties\n    - Rock has still been my most successful move overall\n\n11. Given their pattern of alternating between scissors and paper recently, and the fact that they just played paper, they might play scissors next.\n\n12. Based on their history of playing rock after paper in general (5 out of 9 times), and particularly after winning with paper (3 out of 4 times), rock seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n\n13. To counter rock, paper would be my best move.\n\n14. However, if they continue their recent alternating pattern and play scissors next, paper would lose.\n\n15. Given that I've lost with rock against their paper 3 times now, and with paper against their scissors multiple times, I need to break my own patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
