Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n4. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n5. Rock and scissors have more balanced risk/reward (+1/-1).\n6. Many players tend to choose rock as a first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n7. If I expect rock to be a common first move, paper would be the optimal counter.\n8.

My total score is now -10 points, with 4 ties and 6 losses.\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock.\n4. Looking at their last three moves: scissors, paper, rock - they've cycled through all three options.\n5. They've played rock 4 times, paper 4 times, and scissors 2 times.\n6. I notice that after playing rock (as they just did), they've historically played paper 3 out of 4 times.\n7. Their overall pattern has been difficult to predict, but they seem to have some tendency to follow rock with paper.\n8. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they might play paper next.\n9. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1 point).\n10. However, they've also consistently countered my moves throughout the game, suggesting they might anticipate my scissors and play rock again.\n11. Given that I haven't won a single round yet despite trying different approaches, I need to consider that they might be using a sophisticated strategy or even adapting to my moves in real-time.\n12. After analyzing the entire game, I notice that whenever I've played scissors, they've played rock 3 out of 4 times.\n13. This suggests they might be tracking my moves and have identified a pattern in my behavior.\n14. To break this pattern, I should avoid playing scissors this round.\n15. If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play rock, in which case paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After they've played scissors (as they just did), they've historically played paper 2 out of 3 times.\n8.

My total score is now -14 points, with 4 ties and 8 losses.\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n4. They've now played paper 5 times, rock 4 times, and scissors 3 times.\n5. After 12 rounds, I haven't won a single time, which strongly suggests my opponent is using a sophisticated algorithm that can predict my moves.\n6. They may be using a strategy based on analyzing my move patterns or even anticipating my thought process.\n7. Traditional game theory approaches and pattern recognition have failed consistently.\n8. At this point, I need to try something completely different.\n9. Since they've just played paper, and I've consistently lost regardless of my approach, I should try the move that would be considered least optimal by traditional game theory.\n10. After they've played paper, scissors would be the traditional counter, but given their perfect prediction record, they'll likely anticipate this.\n11. Playing rock would be illogical after losing to paper, which is exactly why it might work - they might not expect me to make such a move.\n12. However, I've tried unconventional approaches before without success.\n13. The most successful I've been is when we tied, which happened when we both played the same move.\n14. Since they just played paper, and paper has been their most frequent move overall (5 times), playing paper myself gives me the highest probability of at least forcing another tie.\n15. If they play paper again, we tie (0 points).\n16. If they play rock, I win (+3 points).\n17. If they play scissors, I lose (-1 point).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 15: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 18: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n2. My total score remains -14 points, with 6 ties, 10 losses, and 2 wins.\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors.\n4. They've now played paper 6 times, rock 5 times, and scissors 7 times overall.\n5. After a tie where both played scissors, my opponent has historically played paper 2 out of 3 times.\n6. Looking at their recent moves, there seems to be a cyclical tendency where they often follow scissors with paper.\n7. After playing scissors (as they just did), they have historically played paper 3 out of 7 times, but this includes the previous pattern of following scissors with paper.\n8. Given that they've just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play paper next, following one of their common patterns after scissors\n   - Play rock, anticipating I might play scissors again or switch to paper\n   - Play scissors again, which would be uncommon for them\n9. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1 point).\n10. If they play rock, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n11. If they play scissors again, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n12. Considering the psychological dynamics after a tie and their historical patterns, rock offers the best expected value as it counters scissors (which they might repeat) and only loses to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played paper 6 times, rock 6 times, and scissors 7 times overall.\n5. We've had three consecutive ties now (scissors, scissors, rock), which is unusual in this game.\n6. After a tie where both played rock, my opponent has historically played paper 1 out of 2 times.\n7. After playing rock (as they just did), they have historically played paper 3 out of 6 times.\n8. Given that they've just played rock, they might:\n   - Play paper next, following one of their common patterns after rock\n   - Play scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their rock\n   - Play rock again, continuing the tie streak\n9. The sequence of three consecutive ties suggests they might be trying a new strategy or deliberately matching my moves.\n10. After three ties in a row, there's strong psychological pressure for both of us to break the tie streak.\n11. If they play paper (their most common move after rock), scissors would be my best counter (+1 point).\n12. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n13. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n14. Given the unusual pattern of three consecutive ties and their historical tendency to follow rock with paper, scissors offers a good chance to finally break this tie streak.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 8: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 15: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 18: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 19: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 24: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n2. My total score is now -24 points, with 7 ties, 16 losses, and 2 wins.\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper.\n4. They've now played paper 8 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 9 times overall.\n5. Their last three moves have been: rock, scissors, paper.\n6. After playing paper (as they just did), they have historically played rock 3 out of 8 times.\n7. I've now lost 7 consecutive rounds, which is an extremely concerning streak.\n8. My opponent seems to have an almost perfect ability to predict and counter my moves.\n9. Given that they've just played paper, they might:\n   - Play rock, following one of their common patterns after paper\n   - Play scissors, anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n   - Play paper again, though they rarely repeat moves consecutively\n10. If they play rock, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n11. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n12. If they play paper again, scissors would be my best counter (+1 point).\n13. At this point, traditional pattern recognition has consistently failed against this opponent.\n14. I need to try something completely different to break this losing streak.\n15. Looking back at the entire game, my only wins came in rounds 13-14, where I played paper and then rock.\n16. Given the psychological dynamics after such a long losing streak and their recent pattern, scissors offers a reasonable chance to break this pattern if they follow paper with rock (as they've often done) or if they repeat paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n14. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n15.

After playing rock (as they just did), they have historically played paper 3 out of 10 times.\n7. I've broken my long losing streak, which is a positive development.\n8. Interestingly, both times I've won with paper against rock (rounds 13 and 27), I followed up with rock and won again.\n9. Given that they've just played rock, they might:\n   - Play paper, following one of their common patterns after rock\n   - Play scissors, anticipating I might play paper again after my win\n   - Play rock a third time, which would be unusual for them\n10. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1 point).\n11. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1 point).\n12.

Looking at my past successes, after winning with paper against rock in round 13, I played rock in round 14 and won against their scissors.\n14.
