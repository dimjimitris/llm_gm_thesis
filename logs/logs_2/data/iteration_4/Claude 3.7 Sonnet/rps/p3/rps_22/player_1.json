Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's sequence across all rounds: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n3. The critical observation: they finally broke their pattern in round 11, playing scissors when the pattern predicted rock.\n4. This suggests my opponent has become aware that I was exploiting their pattern and deliberately changed their strategy.\n5. Now I need to determine if this is a one-time deviation or if they've abandoned their pattern entirely.\n6. If they were following a pattern but made a one-time deviation, they might return to the pattern with rock next.\n7. If they've abandoned their pattern entirely, they might play randomly or adopt a new strategy.\n8. They might also be employing a \"win-stay\" strategy - since scissors just worked for them, they might play scissors again.\n9. Another possibility is that they've shifted their pattern by one move, so instead of rock next, they might play paper (following scissors).\n10. Given that they just broke a very long-established pattern, the most likely explanation is that they've become aware of their predictability.\n11. In the absence of a clear new pattern, and considering they just won with scissors, there's a higher probability they'll play scissors again (win-stay).\n12.

If they're actively countering me, they might expect me to play scissors (to beat their paper), and thus play rock.\n9. If they're using win-stay, they'll play paper again.\n10. Given the uncertainty after they've broken their long-established pattern, and the fact they've won twice by changing their strategy, I need to be less predictable myself.\n11.

Let me completely reconsider my approach.\n\nSteps:\n1. My opponent's last four moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper.\n2. They just repeated paper, which is unusual in standard rock-paper-scissors patterns.\n3. At this point, I need to acknowledge that attempting to find a pattern might not be the best strategy, as they may be deliberately playing unpredictably or directly countering my moves.\n4. Let's consider game theory for rock-paper-scissors: the optimal strategy against a skilled player is actually to play randomly with equal probability for each move.\n5. By playing truly randomly, I make my moves unpredictable and minimize my opponent's ability to exploit patterns in my play.\n6. However, there's still value in considering their recent moves for short-term tactics.\n7. They've just played paper twice in a row, which is unusual.\n8. They might:\n   a) Play paper a third time (triple repeat)\n   b) Switch to something else, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper\n9.

My attempts to predict their next move based on patterns have been unsuccessful in recent rounds.\n4.

This makes my moves unpredictable and prevents my opponent from exploiting any patterns in my play.\n6. I've been trying to be strategic about my choices, but this may have made me predictable.\n7. For this round, I should embrace true randomness rather than trying to outsmart my opponent with pattern recognition.\n8. I'll conceptually divide my decision space into three equal parts and make a random choice:\n   - If I choose the first third: rock\n   - If I choose the second third: paper\n   - If I choose the final third: scissors\n9.
