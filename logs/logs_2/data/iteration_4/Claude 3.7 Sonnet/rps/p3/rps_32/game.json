I need to consider the payoff structure:\n   - Winning with rock or scissors gives me 1 point and opponent loses 1\n   - Winning with paper gives me 3 points and opponent loses 3\n   - Losing with rock or scissors costs me 1 point\n   - Losing with paper costs me 3 points\n   - Ties give 0 points to both\n\n2. This is my first round against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n\n3. In the absence of patterns to exploit, I need to consider the asymmetric payoff structure:\n   - Paper has the highest reward (3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Rock and scissors have lower reward (1) but also lower risk (-1)\n\n4. Since paper has the highest potential payoff, it's tempting to choose it, but that makes me vulnerable to scissors.\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" If that's true, paper would be optimal.\n\n6. However, this is just a probabilistic assumption with no concrete evidence in this case.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I'll choose paper for the higher potential reward, accepting the higher risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The pattern seems to be that my opponent and I are thinking very similarly. After two rounds of following what appeared to be a clockwise pattern (paper \u2192 scissors), we both reset to paper in round 3.\n\n3. This suggests one of two things:\n   - Either we're both using similar logical processes\n   - Or my opponent is deliberately matching my moves\n\n4. For this round, I need to break this cycle of ties.\n\n5. If my opponent is analyzing patterns like I am, they might expect me to choose scissors next (continuing from paper).\n\n6. If they anticipate scissors, they would likely choose rock.\n\n7. To counter this, I should choose paper, which beats rock.\n\n8. However, there's also the possibility they might anticipate this double-level thinking and choose scissors themselves.\n\n9. Given the repeated ties, I think it's most likely my opponent and I are using similar logic. To break the pattern, I'll make a less predictable move.\n\n10.

This is extraordinary - my opponent has now chosen scissors for 12 out of the last 13 rounds, despite losing with it repeatedly. They have now lost 8 times with scissors against my rock.\n\n3. My current score is now +4 points (3 + 1 = +4).\n\n4. My opponent has already made their move for this round, so I need to anticipate what they might have chosen.\n\n5. Their scissors persistence is so extreme that it's clear they must be following a predetermined pattern rather than responding to game outcomes.\n\n6. After losing with scissors to rock four times in a row (and many times overall), any rational player would switch strategies.\n\n7. However, this opponent has consistently demonstrated they don't follow rational game theory.\n\n8.

Finally! After 12 scissors moves in the last 13 rounds, my opponent has switched to paper and caught me off guard.\n\n3. My current score is now +1 points (4 - 3 = +1).\n\n4. This switch suggests my opponent may have been deliberately setting up a pattern to exploit. After I became confident in their scissors preference and repeatedly countered with rock, they switched to paper for maximum damage (-3 points).\n\n5. Now I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - Return to their scissors pattern\n   - Continue with paper after winning with it\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might choose scissors to counter their paper\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, conventional play would suggest they might stick with paper.\n\n7. However, given their previous pattern of scissors persistence despite losses, they might return to scissors again.\n\n8. If they return to scissors, rock would be optimal.\n   If they stay with paper, scissors would be optimal.\n   If they switch to rock, paper would be optimal.\n\n9. Given their demonstrated tendency to use scissors extensively, and the fact they may have only temporarily deviated to catch me off guard, I think there's a higher probability they'll return to scissors.\n\n10. However, I can't be as confident in this prediction as before. I'll choose scissors, which would:\n    - Beat paper if they continue with it\n    - Tie with scissors if they return to their preferred move\n    - Lose to rock if they make that switch\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has already made their move for this round, so I need to anticipate what they might have chosen.\n\n5. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Paper in round 28\n   - Scissors in round 27\n   - Rock in rounds 25-26\n   - Scissors in round 24\n   - Paper in rounds 22-23\n\n6. Their pattern has become less predictable in recent rounds, cycling through different moves.\n\n7. After winning with paper against rock, they might:\n   - Stay with paper after winning with it\n   - Switch to scissors (conventional progression after paper)\n   - Switch to rock (less likely after just winning with paper)\n\n8. Given the conventional progression and their historical preference for scissors, I think there's a higher probability they'll choose scissors this round.\n\n9. To counter their expected scissors move, I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent switched to rock, resulting in a tie.\n\n3. My current score remains at -3 points.\n\n4. After a rock tie, conventional play would suggest choosing paper.\n\n5. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Rock in round 29\n   - Paper in round 28\n   - Scissors in round 27\n   - Rock in rounds 25-26\n   \n6. Their recent moves suggest they might be cycling through all three options somewhat methodically.\n\n7. After a rock tie, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (conventional progression after rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (breaking the pattern)\n   - Stay with rock (less likely after a tie)\n\n8. Given the conventional progression and their pattern in recent rounds, I think there's a higher probability they'll choose paper this round.\n\n9.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
