Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n4. Rock and scissors have more moderate rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n5.

If they play scissors, rock would give me +1.\n8. If they play paper, scissors would give me +1.\n9.

In the first round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie with 0 points.\n2. This gives me some information: my opponent chose paper in the first round.\n3. Players often follow patterns in these games. After playing paper, many players might:\n   - Continue with the same move (paper again)\n   - Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move (scissors would beat paper)\n   - Switch to a completely different move (rock)\n4. If my opponent expects me to play paper again, they might choose scissors to beat me.\n5. If my opponent thinks I'll anticipate their switch to scissors, they might play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n6. This creates a second-level reasoning problem.\n7. Given that paper was just played by both of us, scissors is a common follow-up move to try to win against repeated paper.\n8. If I expect my opponent to play scissors, I should play rock to counter it.\n9. Rock would give me +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they stick with paper.\n10. The potential loss from paper (-3) is significant, but the likelihood of them repeating paper seems lower than them switching.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the likely scissors move from my opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given the unprecedented number of consecutive ties, I need to make a move that breaks from standard rock-paper-scissors psychology.\n12. The fact that we've had so many ties suggests my opponent might be deliberately mirroring me.\n13. If they are mirroring, we'll tie no matter what I choose.\n14. If they're not mirroring but using similar logic, playing rock would be an unexpected move after paper (most would play scissors).\n15. Rock has worked well for me earlier in the game (I won rounds 2 and 4 with it).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this eleventh round to break the pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n2. I finally broke the streak of 5 consecutive ties by playing rock against their scissors.\n3. Looking at the entire game history, I've won 4 rounds (all with scores of +1) and tied 7 rounds.\n4. Every time I've played rock, my opponent has either played scissors (3 times) or rock (2 times), never paper.\n5. After winning with rock, my opponent might expect me to play rock again due to its success.\n6. If they expect rock, they're likely to play paper to counter it.\n7. If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n8. However, they might also anticipate this level of thinking and play rock to beat my expected scissors.\n9. Looking at their overall pattern, after losing a round they've either:\n   - Played the same move again (after round 2, played scissors again in round 4)\n   - Switched to a completely different move\n10. They've played scissors in rounds 2, 4, and 11, which suggests they might avoid it this round after losing with it.\n11. Given that they've never countered my rock with paper in the entire game (which is unusual), and the psychological tendency to switch strategies after losing, scissors seems like a strong play.\n12. If they play paper (to beat my previous rock), scissors would give me +1.\n13. If they play rock (to beat my potential scissors), I would lose 1 point.\n14. If they play scissors again (which would be surprising after losing with it), we would tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this twelfth round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After I won with scissors in round 5, they played rock in round 6.\n9. This suggests they might play rock again after losing to scissors.\n10. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n11. If I play paper and they play rock, I would get +3 points (the highest possible reward).\n12. If I play paper and they play scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n13. If I play paper and they play paper, we would tie.\n14.

I've now won eight consecutive rounds, bringing my total score to +16 points.\n3. The opponent's most recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n4. My most recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5. I've been perfectly predicting and countering their moves for the last 8 rounds.\n6. After losing with paper in round 18, based on their established patterns, they might:\n   - Play rock (following their rotation pattern after losing with paper)\n   - Try something completely different to break their predictability\n7. Looking specifically at what they do after losing with paper:\n   - After round 5: they played rock in round 6\n   - After round 12: they played rock in round 13\n   - After round 15: they played rock in round 16\n   - After round 18: ?\n8. There's a very consistent pattern of them playing rock after losing with paper (3/3 times).\n9. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n10. I've won with paper against their rock before (rounds 13, 16).\n11. If I'm wrong and they play scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n12. If I'm wrong and they play paper again, we would tie.\n13. Given their extremely consistent pattern of playing rock after losing with paper, and my success with paper against their rock, paper seems like the optimal choice.\n14. After 8 consecutive losses, they might finally try to break their pattern, but their behavior throughout the game suggests they follow predictable patterns rather than adapting strategically.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this nineteenth round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After losing with rock in round 25, based on their established patterns, they might:\n   - Play scissors (following their rotation pattern after losing with rock)\n   - Finally break their pattern after so many consecutive losses\n7.

There's an extremely consistent pattern of them playing scissors after losing with rock (4/4 times).\n9. If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n10. I've won with rock against their scissors before (rounds 2, 4, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23).\n11. If I'm wrong and they play rock again, we would tie.\n12. If I'm wrong and they play paper, I would lose 3 points.\n13. Given their extremely consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock, and my success with rock against their scissors, rock seems like the optimal choice.\n14. Even after 15 consecutive losses, they've shown no signs of adapting their strategy or breaking their predictable rotation pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this twenty-sixth round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
