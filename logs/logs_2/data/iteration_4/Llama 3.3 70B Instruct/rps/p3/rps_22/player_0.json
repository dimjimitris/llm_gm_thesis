    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We can't assume that the other player will continue to mirror our moves, so we need to be prepared for anything.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): That's a good point. In this situation, it's difficult to predict what the other player will do. We could try to analyze the other player's previous moves and look for any patterns or weaknesses.\n\nGame Analyst: However, with only one round of non-mirroring data, it's difficult to draw any conclusions. We might need to rely on a more general strategy that takes into account the possibilities of rock, paper, and scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): In that case, let's consider a strategy that balances our chances of winning. We could choose a move that has a moderate chance of beating the other player's potential moves.\n\nGame Analyst: That's a good idea. Given the current situation, choosing paper might be a good option. It beats rock, which is a common move, and it's not too risky.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): I agree, choosing paper seems like a reasonable strategy for this round.\n\n[move] (Choosing paper to balance our chances of winning) paper\n"

This could be an opportunity for us to try and break their mirroring strategy again.\n\nGame Analyst: To break the mirroring strategy, we need to think of a way to make the other player hesitant or uncertain about their next move. One way to do this is to create a situation where they're not sure what we'll do next.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): That's a good point. If we can create a sense of unpredictability, we might be able to make the other player question their mirroring strategy. Let's think about how we can create this unpredictability.\n\nGame Analyst: One way to create unpredictability is to make a move that is not obviously related to the previous moves. For example, if we choose scissors, it's not clear what the other player will do, since they might not be expecting us to choose scissors after choosing paper last time.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): I agree, choosing scissors could be a good way to create unpredictability and potentially break the other player's mirroring strategy.\n\n[move] (Choosing scissors to create unpredictability and potentially break the mirroring strategy) scissors\n"

We need to think of a way to break this pattern and gain an advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): Yes, it's clear that the other player is still using a strategy that involves mirroring our moves. To break this strategy, we need to think of a way to make a move that is not obvious and takes into account the possibility of the other player mirroring us.\n\nGame Analyst: One approach could be to try to mix up our moves and make it difficult for the other player to predict what we'll do next. If we can make our moves unpredictable, we might be able to catch the other player off guard and gain an advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): That's a good idea. Let's think about how we can mix up our moves and make them less predictable. We could try to use a random sequence of moves, or we could try to use a more complex algorithm to determine our next move.\n\nGame Analyst: Using a random sequence of moves or a complex algorithm might make our moves less predictable, but it's not guaranteed to give us an advantage. We need to think about the underlying probabilities of the game and try to make a move that takes into account those probabilities.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): I agree, let's think about the underlying probabilities of the game. Since the other player has been mirroring our moves, they might be more likely to choose the same move as us. In that case, choosing a move that is less likely to be chosen by the other player might give us an advantage.\n\nGame Analyst: If we choose a move that is less likely to be chosen by the other player, we might be able to gain an advantage. Let's think about which move is less likely to be chosen by the other player.\n\nAI Assistant (myself): Since the other player has been mirroring our moves, they might be more likely to choose rock or paper, as these are the moves that we have chosen most recently. In that case, choosing scissors might be a good option, as it is less likely to be chosen by the other player.\n\nGame Analyst: I agree, choosing scissors seems like a good strategy for this round.\n\n[move] (Choosing scissors as a move that is less likely to be chosen by the other player) scissors\n"
