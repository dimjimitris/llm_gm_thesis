Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first round and the other player is fresh, there's no information about their playing style or previous moves.\n4. Given the payoff matrix, the safest move in terms of minimizing potential loss would be to choose a move that can either win or tie, as losing to a move that gives -3 points (like paper losing to scissors) could put me at a significant disadvantage from the start.\n5. Considering the options:\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper.\n   - Paper beats rock but loses to scissors.\n   - Scissors beats paper but loses to rock.\n6. Without any information about the other player's move, the best strategy is to choose a move that has the potential to win but also limits the potential loss to -1 point, as all winning moves except one (paper over rock) give a +1 or +3 reward, while all losing moves give a -1 or -3 penalty.\n7. Given the choices and the fact that I want to minimize the risk of losing -3 points in the first round, I could choose rock or scissors, as both of these moves, if they lose, would only result in a -1 point penalty.\n8. Between rock and scissors, both are equally risky without more information, but choosing scissors might give me a slight advantage if the other player is inclined to choose rock, as this would give me a win.\n9. Therefore, my move, based on minimizing risk and maximizing the potential for a win without significant penalty, will be scissors.\n\nMove: scissors\n"

The game is rock-paper-scissors, and the objective is to maximize points while minimizing penalties.\n2. Each move has its strengths and weaknesses: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.\n3. Given that this is the first round against a fresh player, there's no information about their playing style or preferred moves.\n4. The payoff matrix shows that winning with rock or scissors yields 1 point, while winning with paper yields 3 points. Conversely, losing to rock or scissors results in a -1 point penalty, and losing to paper results in a -3 point penalty.\n5. Without specific information about the opponent's move, a safe approach would be to select a move that limits the potential loss to -1 point, as losing with paper would incur a -3 point penalty, which could be significant early in the game.\n6. Both rock and scissors are moves that, if they lose, would only result in a -1 point penalty, making them relatively safer choices in the absence of additional information.\n7.

The third round ended in a tie, with both of us playing rock, resulting in 0 points for that round.\n4. The overall score is currently -2 points.\n5. Given the history, the opponent has shown a willingness to play rock and scissors, and the last round was a tie with both playing rock.\n6. The fact that the last round was a tie with rock suggests that the opponent might stick with rock or switch to paper, aiming to capitalize on a potential repeat of my previous mistakes.\n7. To counter this and potentially gain points, playing a move that can beat rock would be strategic. However, since paper lost to scissors in the second round, there's a risk the opponent might play scissors again.\n8. Given the need to break the tie and start accumulating points, and considering the potential moves and their outcomes:\n   - Rock is less likely to yield a significant advantage since the last round was a tie with this move.\n   - Paper could be risky if the opponent plays scissors again.\n   - Scissors could potentially yield a +1 point reward if the opponent sticks with rock or decides to play paper, as scissors beats paper.\n9.
