The payoff matrix for this game is as follows:\n   - rock beats scissors: +1 point\n   - paper beats rock: +3 points\n   - scissors beats paper: +1 point\n   - tie: 0 points\n3. Given the symmetry of the game and the lack of information about the opponent, a reasonable initial strategy is to choose a move that has the potential to win, regardless of the opponent's choice.\n4. Considering the potential wins, choosing \"rock\" could be a straightforward starting point, as it has the potential to beat scissors and is a common initial choice in such games.\n\nBased on these steps, my decision is to start with \"rock\" as it's a basic and often-used move that can lead to a win if the opponent chooses scissors.\n\nrock (Starting with a basic move to gauge the opponent's strategy)\n"
