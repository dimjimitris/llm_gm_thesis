    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've returned to scissors, which has been their most consistent strategy\n2. Rock has been my most successful counter to their scissors preference\n3. When I try to be too clever or predict multiple moves ahead, they usually outplay me\n4. Even if they predict this and play paper, taking the -3 risk seems worth it given their strong scissors tendency\n5. Sometimes the straightforward counter to their most frequent move is the best choice\n"

After losing multiple times to rock, they're very likely to switch to paper\n2. They've consistently shown they can adapt their strategy when losing\n3. My recent success with rock makes it too obvious a choice now\n4. If they do predict this and play rock, I lose 1 point, which is better than losing 3 to a paper counter\n5. They're too skilled to keep falling for the same move, and they've shown throughout the game they can break patterns when needed\n"
