    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward ratios of different moves\n4. Decision Maker (myself) - For making final decisions based on inputs\n\nStarting collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when winning against rock, while having a relatively small penalty (-1) when losing to scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a new player, people often tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This psychological tendency could be exploited.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the risk-reward ratios:\n- Paper: +3/-1 (wins big vs rock, small loss vs scissors)\n- Rock: +1/-3 (small win vs scissors, big loss vs paper)\n- Scissors: +1/-1 (balanced risk-reward)\n\nDecision Maker: Based on these inputs, paper seems like the optimal first move because:\n1. It has the highest potential reward\n2. It exploits the common tendency of new players to choose rock\n3. Even if we lose, the penalty is minimal (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. The risk-reward ratio for paper is most favorable, especially in the opening move.\n\n[move] paper This move offers the best risk-reward ratio and exploits common opening tendencies of new players.\n"

Expect us to stick with paper and counter with scissors\n2. Switch to scissors themselves thinking we might stick with paper\n\nTherefore, I suggest we choose rock. While it has a higher potential loss against paper, it would beat scissors, which seems to be the most likely move from our opponent given the previous round.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock does seem like a good counter to the most probable moves in this situation.

This suggests they're a strategic player who will try to counter our previous successful move.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that:\n1. Our opponent has shown strategic thinking\n2.

Avoid paper after just losing with it\n2. Consider rock as a safe defensive move\n3. Might expect us to repeat our successful scissors\n4.

The crucial nature of this round\n\nI suggest we play rock.

After mutual defensive plays, there's often a shift to aggressive moves\n2. Opponent needs to score to catch up\n3. They might expect us to maintain defensive posture to protect our lead\n4.

The combination of the previous defensive tie and their need to catch up makes paper a highly probable move from them - it breaks the defensive pattern and offers their best scoring opportunity.\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating opponent will play paper to break the defensive pattern and attempt to score significant points to overcome our lead.\n"

The opponent's remarkable commitment to rock, even when we tried to counter it, suggests they value strategic consistency and defensive stability. In our must-win situation, we need to make the direct counter to their demonstrated preference.\n\n[move] paper Making the direct counter to opponent's demonstrated rock preference, needing to score in this must-win situation.\n"
