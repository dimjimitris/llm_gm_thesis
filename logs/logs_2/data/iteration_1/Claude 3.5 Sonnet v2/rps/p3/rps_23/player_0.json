    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has highest payoff (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower payoff (1 point)\n   - Matching moves results in 0 points\n   - Losing results in corresponding negative points\n\n3. Without any prior information, I should consider:\n   - Paper has potential for highest reward\n   - Paper is vulnerable to scissors (but only -1 point loss)\n   - Rock is safe against scissors but vulnerable to paper (-3 point loss)\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in first rounds\n   - Paper would be optimal against rock\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie\n\n5.

Psychology consideration:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - My opponent might expect me to change my move\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to rock or scissors\n\n3.

Pattern after their consecutive losses:\n   - They've lost twice in a row now (-3, -1)\n   - Their total recent loss is -4 points\n   - They're likely feeling significant pressure\n   - They need to break my winning streak\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They're likely frustrated with consecutive losses\n   - They might expect me to be overconfident\n   - They know I successfully predicted paper twice\n   - They've shown ability to adapt under pressure\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they expect me to continue with scissors, they'll play rock\n   - If they try paper again, scissors wins\n   - If they try scissors themselves, rock wins\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Scissors would be too predictable after just winning with it\n   - They're likely to counter with rock if I repeat scissors\n   - They rarely repeat moves that just lost\n   - Rock would:\n     * Beat their scissors if they try to counter expected paper (+1)\n     * Protect against their likely rock play (0)\n     * Only lose to paper (-3)\n   - Given their need to break my streak\n   - And their likely counter to my scissors success\n   - Rock provides best protection against their probable moves\n\n[move] rock\n"
