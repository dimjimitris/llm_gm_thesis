Analysis of ties:\n   - We've had two ties now (paper and scissors)\n   - After our first tie (paper), they switched to scissors\n   - Players typically change moves after a tie\n   - They might expect me to switch from scissors\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They haven't won in several rounds\n   - Their last winning move was paper\n   - After ties, they've historically made aggressive moves\n   - They might try to replicate their previous success\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to rock (defensive), paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to paper (their last winning move), scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they stay with scissors (unlikely after tie), rock wins (+1)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They're most likely to switch after a tie\n   - Paper gave them their only win, they might return to it\n   - Their pattern suggests aggressive plays when frustrated\n   - Scissors would be risky after a scissors tie\n   - Rock provides good defense and winning potential\n\n[move] rock\n"
