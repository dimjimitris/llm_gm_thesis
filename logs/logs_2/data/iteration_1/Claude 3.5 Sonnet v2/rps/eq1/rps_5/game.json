In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information:\n   - Each move has an equal 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying\n   - No move is inherently stronger than others\n   - Players often have psychological tendencies in their first moves\n\n3. Common first-move patterns I should consider:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\"\n   - Some players think others will choose rock, so they choose paper\n   - More sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose scissors\n\n4. Without any additional information, trying to overthink might be counterproductive.\n\n5. Given these considerations, I will choose paper:\n   - It beats the common first-move choice of rock\n   - Even if I lose to scissors, I'll gain information about the opponent's style\n   - If they also choose paper, the tie gives me more information for next round\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent pattern:\n   - We've just had two ties with rock in the last three rounds\n   - Between these ties, they successfully used scissors\n   - They seem to be mixing defensive (rock) and aggressive (scissors) plays\n\n3. Post-double-tie psychology:\n   - Two recent ties with rock creates strong pressure to change\n   - They've shown they're willing to stick with rock\n   - But three rocks in a row would be unusual\n   - Most players would definitely switch after two rock ties\n\n4. Their possible thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat the rock pattern\n   - They've successfully countered my paper plays with scissors before\n   - They might think I'm too cautious to play paper after recent scissors losses\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their success with scissors against my paper\n   - And the strong psychological pressure to change after two rock ties\n   - They're most likely to switch to either paper or scissors\n   - Paper is more likely as it's a safer play against potential rock\n   - I'll use scissors to counter their likely paper play\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors, anticipating their switch to paper after two rock ties.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Without any historical data, the safest approach is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n4. Rock is often a common first move for many players because it feels \"strong\" psychologically. This could make paper a good counter.\n\n5.
