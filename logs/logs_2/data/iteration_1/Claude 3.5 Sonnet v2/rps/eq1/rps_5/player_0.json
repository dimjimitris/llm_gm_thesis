    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information:\n   - Each move has an equal 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying\n   - No move is inherently stronger than others\n   - Players often have psychological tendencies in their first moves\n\n3. Common first-move patterns I should consider:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\"\n   - Some players think others will choose rock, so they choose paper\n   - More sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose scissors\n\n4. Without any additional information, trying to overthink might be counterproductive.\n\n5. Given these considerations, I will choose paper:\n   - It beats the common first-move choice of rock\n   - Even if I lose to scissors, I'll gain information about the opponent's style\n   - If they also choose paper, the tie gives me more information for next round\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Post-double-tie psychology:\n   - Two recent ties with rock creates strong pressure to change\n   - They've shown they're willing to stick with rock\n   - But three rocks in a row would be unusual\n   - Most players would definitely switch after two rock ties\n\n4. Their possible thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat the rock pattern\n   - They've successfully countered my paper plays with scissors before\n   - They might think I'm too cautious to play paper after recent scissors losses\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their success with scissors against my paper\n   - And the strong psychological pressure to change after two rock ties\n   - They're most likely to switch to either paper or scissors\n   - Paper is more likely as it's a safer play against potential rock\n   - I'll use scissors to counter their likely paper play\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors, anticipating their switch to paper after two rock ties.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
