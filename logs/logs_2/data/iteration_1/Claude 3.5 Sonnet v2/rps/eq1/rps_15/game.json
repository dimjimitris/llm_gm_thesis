Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Rock beats scissors but loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock but loses to scissors \n   - Scissors beats paper but loses to rock\n\n3. In this situation, game theory suggests that the optimal strategy is to choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\n4. Since there's no pattern to exploit yet, I'll start with a balanced choice. Rock is often a common opening move by players, so I'll counter that tendency.\n\n5. Paper would be a good counter to an opening rock move, while only being vulnerable to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyzing the tie situation:\n   - Both of us chose rock\n   - Rock was a defensive move after scissors\n   - This suggests opponent might also be simplifying their strategy\n\n3. Post-tie psychology:\n   - Earlier in the game, after ties:\n     * We've seen players often change moves\n     * But also sometimes stick with same move\n   - This opponent specifically:\n     * Has shown they're very good at prediction\n     * Often makes unexpected choices\n     * Doesn't usually fall into obvious patterns\n\n4. Current game dynamics:\n   - My simpler strategy (rock) at least stopped the losing streak\n   - Opponent might expect me to continue simplifying\n   - They might try to exploit this expectation\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - After rock-rock tie, paper is the obvious counter\n   - They might expect this and play scissors\n   - However, given their sophisticated play:\n     * They might expect me to overthink and stick with rock\n     * Or they might expect me to use scissors anticipating their paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll use rock again. While it might seem overly simple, it protects against scissors (if they expect me to play paper) and ties against a rock repeat. Given their high-level play, they might overthink and expect a more complex strategy from me.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence:\n   - Tied with paper vs paper\n   - Won with rock vs scissors\n   - Lost with scissors vs rock\n   - Current score: -1 points\n   - Breaking from successful rock strategy failed\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Rock has been dominant recently\n   - I deviated from working strategy and lost\n   - Opponent correctly predicted my pattern break\n   - They're still reading the game better\n\n3. Opponent's strategy:\n   - They used rock to beat my scissors\n   - They've shown excellent adaptation\n   - They predicted I'd move away from rock\n   - They're consistently one step ahead\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - Lost momentum after getting back to even\n   - Need to avoid tilt after failed strategy change\n   - They've proven they can read complex strategies\n   - Simpler plays were working better\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After winning with rock:\n     * They might stick with successful move\n     * They might expect paper counter\n     * They might switch to scissors expecting my paper\n     * They've often succeeded with straightforward plays\n     * They punish overthinking consistently\n\nFinal decision: I'll use paper. They've just succeeded with rock, and while they might expect this obvious counter, my attempts at complex strategy have often failed. When they're in a strong position, they've often made straightforward plays rather than overthinking. Sometimes the direct counter is correct.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Paper-tie analysis:\n   - Both chose the logical counter to previous rock\n   - We're often thinking along similar lines\n   - Previous paper ties have led to varied responses\n   - But straightforward play has been more successful\n\n3.

Success analysis:\n   - Rock has won multiple times against scissors\n   - Protective, defensive strategy working well\n   - Avoiding obvious paper\u2192scissors progression paid off\n   - Simple, straightforward thinking is working\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
