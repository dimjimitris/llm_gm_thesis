In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability of being played to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a new player, people often tend to choose 'rock' as their first move. This is a common psychological pattern observed in rock-paper-scissors, as rock is perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on multiple studies, rock is indeed the most common opening move, chosen approximately 35-40% of the time, followed by paper (30-35%) and scissors (25-30%).\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, playing 'paper' would be a rational choice as it would beat the statistically most likely move (rock).\n\nDecision Maker (myself): The analysis suggests that paper would be our best opening move, as it would counter the most common opening move (rock) while still being a reasonable choice against other possibilities.\n\n[move] paper\n"

More likely, they might switch to scissors to beat our previous winning move (paper), assuming we might use it again\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on historical patterns, after losing a round, players switch their move approximately 70% of the time. Given that we played paper and won against their rock, there's a high probability they'll switch to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: If we predict they'll switch to scissors to counter our previous paper move, we should play rock to counter their scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological tendency to counter the previous winning move is strong, especially in the early rounds when players are still establishing patterns.\n\nDecision Maker (myself): The analysis suggests that rock would be our best move here, as it would counter the likely scissors play from our opponent who is probably trying to beat our previous paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Becoming more defensive\n2. Returning to what they perceive as their strongest move\n3. Avoiding their last losing move (paper)\nThis often translates to choosing rock, which is psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" and most defensive option.\n\nDecision Maker (myself): The psychological impact of losing right after achieving their first tie is likely to push them back to their comfort zone.

They're unlikely to repeat scissors (just lost)\n2. They might avoid rock (too obvious as counter)\n3. This often leads to paper as the remaining choice\n4. However, in states of extreme frustration, players often revert to rock\n\nPsychology Expert: When players reach this level of consistent defeat:\n1. They often revert to their most basic instincts\n2. Rock represents psychological security\n3. They might abandon strategy completely\n4. Could make an \"emotional\" return to their comfort move\n\nDecision Maker (myself): Despite the logical progression suggesting paper, I believe they will revert to rock because:\n1. It's their historical comfort move\n2. In states of extreme frustration, players often return to basics\n3. They've shown a pattern of returning to rock when heavily pressured\n4. The psychological need for security often overrides strategic thinking at this point\n\n[move] paper\n"

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
