    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In rock-paper-scissors, with a fresh opponent and no prior history, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability of being chosen (1/3). This prevents being exploited by any predictable patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might tend to choose 'rock' as it's a common first choice for many players. Studies have shown that rock is chosen about 35% of the time in opening moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the equal payoff structure (+1/-1) and the psychological insight about 'rock' being a common first move, paper would provide the best risk-adjusted potential return. If they choose rock, we win; if they choose scissors, we lose; if they choose paper, we tie.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the risk analysis. While any move has equal theoretical value in a single isolated game, the psychological edge of playing paper against a likely rock makes it slightly favorable.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur. Let's go with paper for this opening move, as it counters the most common opening choice (rock) while maintaining a balanced risk profile.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. The downside risk is acceptable, and we have a psychological edge.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might be using similar psychological reasoning to us\n2. After a tie, players often change their move, thinking their opponent will stick to the same choice\n3. They might expect us to switch to scissors, thinking we'll try to beat their paper\n\nGame Strategist: From a game theory perspective, while random selection remains optimal in the long run, we can exploit short-term psychological patterns. When both players tie with paper, there's often a tendency for at least one player to switch to scissors to beat the previous paper play.\n\nRisk Analyst: We have two main options to consider:\n1. Stay with paper - risky as opponent likely to switch\n2. Switch to rock - this would beat their scissors if they make the expected switch\n3. Switch to scissors - this would win if they stay with paper but lose if they switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for this round. Here's why:\n- If they expect us to stay with paper, they might choose scissors\n- If they expect us to choose scissors (to beat their previous paper), they might choose rock\n- Rock would win against scissors and tie against rock\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the rock strategy. The psychological pressure to change moves after a tie is strong, and scissors is the most logical next move for them if they're thinking one step ahead.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk-reward ratio for rock looks favorable here. It protects against the most likely opponent move (scissors) while only being vulnerable to paper, which is less likely given the previous round's outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

They anticipated we might switch to rock to counter potential scissors\n2. They've used paper twice now, successfully in different contexts\n3. We need to consider if they're trying to establish a pattern to trap us\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -1 points, which puts us in a slightly disadvantaged position. We need to be strategic but not overly reactive to our loss.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the sequence:\nRound 1: Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Paper beats our Rock\nTheir pattern so far shows paper twice, which is statistically unusual. This could mean:\n1. They might stick with a winning strategy and use paper again\n2. They might expect us to use scissors to counter their paper trend\n3. They could switch to scissors anticipating our scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: Given they've shown sophisticated thinking, they're likely aware we've observed their paper pattern. They might expect us to use scissors to counter paper, which would lead them to use rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: The situation calls for careful consideration:\n- Using scissors is obvious but risky if they switch to rock\n- Using rock could work if they switch to scissors\n- Using paper would be unexpected at this point\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors despite it being the obvious choice. Here's why:\n1. Even sophisticated players can't always avoid patterns\n2. The psychological pressure to switch after two papers is very strong\n3. If they do use paper again, we need to punish that strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. While scissors is the obvious counter, sometimes the obvious play is correct. The potential reward outweighs the risk here.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Third round: Predicted our scissors counter and beat it with rock\n3. They appear to be thinking one step ahead of us consistently\n4. Total sequence: Paper-Paper-Rock\n\nGame Strategist: We're down -2 points now, which indicates we need to adjust our strategy significantly. Let's analyze their possible thinking:\n1. They might expect us to be frustrated and make an emotional decision\n2. Their sequence doesn't show any direct repeating pattern\n3. They seem to be using psychological baiting effectively\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a critical moment:\n- We've lost twice consecutively\n- Our opponent has shown they can anticipate our logical counters\n- We need to break out of the pattern of being predicted\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations where an opponent is successfully reading our moves, sometimes the best approach is to return to basics. They've shown they can outthink our strategic adjustments, so we might want to consider a more fundamental approach.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper for this round. Here's the reasoning:\n1. After using rock successfully, many players will stick with it\n2. If they're thinking multiple steps ahead, they might expect us to use paper to beat their rock, and thus switch to scissors\n3. However, given their sophisticated play, they might also expect us to overthink and try something else\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper is indeed risky, but consider:\n- Rock hasn't appeared twice in their sequence yet\n- They might stick with rock after its success\n- Even sophisticated players sometimes rely on momentum\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with paper.

They appear to be either extremely skilled or have developed a strong read on our decision-making process\n\nRisk Analyst: We're in a very disadvantaged position:\n- Three consecutive losses\n- Each of our strategic approaches has been countered\n- Traditional pattern recognition isn't working\n- We need a significant strategy shift\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze deeper:\n1. Our opponent has used each move exactly once in the last three rounds\n2. They haven't repeated any immediate moves\n3. They seem to be playing a perfect counter-strategy to our moves\n4. This suggests either exceptional prediction skills or possible access to our decision-making\n\nPsychology Expert: Given the situation, I propose we need to make our decision-making process as opaque as possible. When facing a superior opponent, sometimes the best strategy is to be truly random.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's use a genuinely random approach. I suggest rock for this reason:\n1. It breaks any pattern they might have detected in our play\n2. It's the move we haven't used recently\n3. Most importantly, we're choosing it without trying to overthink the opponent's strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: The random approach with rock has merit:\n- We can't do worse than our current strategy\n- It protects against scissors, which they haven't used in two rounds\n- It removes the psychological burden of trying to outthink an opponent who's reading us well\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

After a tie, players often feel a psychological need to \"win\" the next round\n\nGame Strategist: The tie gives us a moment to reset. Looking at the full sequence:\n1. They haven't used paper in 3 rounds\n2. They demonstrated strong adaptability early\n3. The tie might indicate they're becoming more predictable or shifting strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options after this tie:\n1. Stay with rock - could lead to another tie\n2. Switch to paper - would win against rock if they stay\n3. Switch to scissors - would lose against rock if they stay\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, there are typically three common psychological responses:\n1. Stick with the same move, hoping to outguess the opponent\n2. Switch to what would have beaten both players' previous move\n3. Switch to what would have lost to both players' previous move\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for this round. Here's why:\n1. After a tie, players often stick with their previous move, especially if it broke a pattern\n2. Paper beats rock while being relatively safe against scissors\n3.

Both players might be eager to break the tie streak\n2. The pressure to win might lead to more aggressive plays\n3. The obvious progression from rock would be paper\n4. But both players have shown they can think beyond obvious moves\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure is mounting:\n1. Four consecutive ties create a strong desire to break the pattern\n2. Both players might be frustrated with the stalemate\n3. There's a risk of both players overthinking\n4. The opponent might expect us to make a bold move\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with rock. Here's why:\n1. The pressure to change moves after multiple ties might lead our opponent to switch\n2. They might expect us to use paper as the obvious counter to rock\n3. By staying with rock, we protect against scissors if they try to counter our expected paper\n4. Sometimes, stability is unexpected\n\nRisk Analyst: Staying with rock has merit:\n- We've established a non-losing streak\n- The opponent might feel more pressure to change than we do\n- If they switch to paper, we accept that risk\n- If they switch to scissors, we win\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

But they might also expect us to avoid the obvious\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. They might expect us to play scissors to counter paper\n2. Rock beats their potential scissors\n3. If they stay with paper, we accept that loss\n4. Breaking pattern with rock might catch them off guard\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock offers good potential:\n- Protects against likely scissors counter\n- Shows we can think beyond obvious moves\n- Paper loss is acceptable risk\n- We need to try breaking this tie sequence\n\nPsychology Expert: Agree with rock. After two ties and with scissors being the obvious counter to paper, they're likely to either:\n1. Play scissors expecting us to repeat paper or\n2. Expect us to play scissors and counter with rock themselves\n\nRock positions us well against scissors while accepting the risk of paper. In this complex mind game, sometimes playing defensively against the most likely counter is better than making the obvious counter ourselves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
