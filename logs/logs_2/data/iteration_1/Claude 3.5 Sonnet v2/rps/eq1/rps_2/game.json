Analysis of last round:\n   - My repeat scissors strategy failed\n   - They successfully adapted with rock\n   - They've shown they can break patterns and adapt\n\n3. Their current position:\n   - They just won their first round\n   - This success might encourage them to:\n     a) Stick with their winning move (rock)\n     b) Feel confident to try something new\n     c) Try to start a winning streak\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - After their first win, they'll be more confident\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors after losing\n   - Their rock move worked well, creating temptation to reuse it\n\n5. Strategy analysis:\n   - If they repeat rock: paper wins\n   - If they expect paper from me: scissors wins\n   - If they try to complete a pattern: paper wins against rock\n\n6. Risk evaluation:\n   - Their most recent success was with rock\n   - Players often stick with winning moves\n   - Even if they don't, they might expect me to play rock to beat their potential scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper because:\n- It beats rock if they repeat their winning move\n- It's a strong counter to their demonstrated preference for rock\n- Even if they switch to scissors, the risk is worth taking given their shown patterns\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern recognition:\n   - Two consecutive ties show increasing adaptation\n   - They've used all three moves now\n   - Their play style has evolved from predictable to more sophisticated\n\n3. Post-tie psychology:\n   - After the paper tie, both players know the other's thinking\n   - Similar to the previous scissors tie, there's pressure to switch\n   - They've shown they can mirror moves effectively\n\n4. Recent trend analysis:\n   - They went from rock (win) to paper (tie)\n   - Their confidence should be stable after a win and tie\n   - They're demonstrating better prediction of my moves\n\n5.

Psychological pressure points:\n   - Four ties creates intense pressure to break the pattern\n   - Both players likely feeling frustrated with ties\n   - The need to win might lead to more aggressive plays\n\n4.

Pattern evolution:\n   - Early game: Mixed results\n   - Mid game: Long mirroring streak\n   - Recent: My winning streak\n   - Now: Return to mirroring\n   - They seem most comfortable with mirroring strategy\n\n3. Current situation:\n   - Coming off scissors tie\n   - Opponent showing strong prediction/matching ability again\n   - Traditional strategy hasn't worked against their mirroring\n   - Need to break this new mirroring streak early\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They've regained confidence by stopping their losses\n   - They're comfortable with their mirroring strategy\n   - They might be anticipating my moves through:\n     a) Pattern recognition\n     b) Some form of prediction\n     c) Possible tells in my strategy\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - After scissors tie, conventional choices are:\n     a) Rock (safe, obvious)\n     b) Stay scissors (very unexpected)\n     c) Paper (risky, counters obvious rock)\n\n6. Meta-strategy consideration:\n   - Conventional responses haven't broken their mirroring\n   - Need to focus on being unpredictable\n   - Must break both their prediction and the natural game flow\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors again because:\n- It's the most counterintuitive move after a scissors tie\n- Nobody expects the same move three times\n- When an opponent is successfully predicting/matching, the most unexpected move might break their pattern\n- It defies conventional rock-paper-scissors strategy\n- Previous success came from making unexpected repeat moves\n\n[move] scissors\n"
