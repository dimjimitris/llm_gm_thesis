Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing, players often change their strategy\n   - They might assume I'll play paper again since it worked\n   - They're likely to either:\n     a) Play scissors to counter my previous paper\n     b) Play something completely different to be unpredictable\n\n3.

Pattern Recognition:\n   - Opponent has shown a peculiar consistency:\n   - They've repeated their sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This suggests they might be:\n     a) Playing somewhat automatically\n     b) Unable to break free from their own pattern\n     c) Failing to adapt to my moves\n\n3.

Recent History Review:\n   - Round 21: Tie (both paper)\n   - Round 22: Won (rock vs scissors)\n   - Round 23: Tie (both paper)\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - My moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Pattern is strongly repeating from previous rounds\n\n2. Pattern Analysis:\n   - Three paper ties in last five rounds\n   - After paper ties, they've shown:\n     * Tendency to switch to scissors\n     * Then returning to paper after losing\n   - This creates a predictable cycle\n\n3. Psychological State:\n   - Multiple paper ties suggest:\n     * They're reading some of my moves better\n     * Growing confidence with paper plays\n     * But still failing when they deviate\n   - They might see paper as their \"safe\" move\n\n4. Strategic Considerations:\n   - The paper tie cycle has become:\n     * Too predictable\n     * A comfort zone for them\n     * A pattern that needs breaking\n   - They've lost repeatedly when deviating from paper\n\n5. Decision Making:\n   - Given the multiple paper ties\n   - Given their pattern after ties (switching to scissors)\n   - Given their need to break the paper cycle\n   - I'll play rock to:\n     * Counter their likely scissors play\n     * Break the paper tie pattern proactively\n     * Take advantage of their historical post-tie behavior\n     * Force them out of their paper comfort zone\n     * Maintain strategic dominance while avoiding predictability\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern Analysis:\n   - Their behavior has become highly predictable:\n     * After paper ties, they play scissors\n     * Lose to rock\n     * Return to paper\n   - They're stuck in a losing cycle\n   - This is the third time this exact sequence has occurred\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
