    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any prior history to analyze their patterns.\n2. In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what most people might play in the first round.\n3. Research suggests that \"rock\" is the most common first move people make in rock-paper-scissors, as it's perceived as strong or stable.\n4. If my opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n5. However, if my opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors instead.\n6. Since I have no prior information, I need to make a strategic choice that doesn't rely on predicting my opponent.\n7. Each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying in a truly random game.\n8. Without additional information, any move is theoretically equivalent in expected value.\n9. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it counters the statistically common first move of rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy after losing.\n3. Common psychology suggests that players who lose with one move often switch to a different move in the next round.\n4. Since my opponent played rock last time and lost, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n5. If they're thinking strategically, they might anticipate that I'll expect them to switch, and might predict I'll play scissors (to beat their expected paper).\n6. In that case, they might play rock again to beat my expected scissors.\n7. Alternatively, they might simply follow a rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) and play paper next.\n8. Given these considerations, the most likely moves from my opponent are paper (simple switch) or rock (strategic anticipation of my move).\n9. If I expect paper, I should play scissors. If I expect rock again, I should play paper again.\n10. Since players who lose are more likely to switch than to stay with the same move, I'll anticipate my opponent playing paper this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

In the first round, I played paper against their rock. In the second round, I played scissors against their paper.\n2. My opponent seems to be following a simple rotation pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ...\n3. If they continue this pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n4. However, since they've lost twice, they might be more likely to break any pattern and try something unexpected.\n5. They might also be analyzing my moves and notice that I've played paper \u2192 scissors, which could suggest to them that I'm following a rotation pattern myself.\n6. If they think I'm following a rotation, they might expect me to play rock next, and would counter with paper.\n7. Alternatively, they could be frustrated after two losses and revert to a \"strong\" opening move like rock.\n8. I have three main possibilities to consider:\n   - They play scissors (continuing their rotation)\n   - They play paper (anticipating my rock)\n   - They play rock (resetting to a common starting move)\n9. If I expect scissors, I should play rock. If I expect paper, I should play scissors. If I expect rock, I should play paper.\n10.
