Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock to counter it.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might stick to their alternating pattern and play rock after paper.\n\n10. Given that I just won with scissors against their paper, and their pattern suggests rock is next, I'll play paper:\n    - If they play rock (following their pattern or trying to counter my previous scissors), I win\n    - If they play scissors (breaking their pattern), I lose\n    - If they play paper, we tie\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. After playing rock in previous rounds:\n   - In round 3, they followed rock with paper\n   - In round 6, they followed rock with paper\n   - In round 12, they followed rock with paper\n   - Their historical pattern strongly suggests paper after rock\n\n4. However, the opponent has been adapting their strategy throughout the game, becoming less predictable.\n\n5. Looking at our tie situations:\n   - After our first tie in round 1 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After our second tie in round 2 (both rock), they played paper\n   - After our third tie in round 8 (both paper), they played paper again\n   - After our fourth tie in round 9 (both rock), they played paper\n   - After our fifth tie in round 14 (both scissors), they played scissors again\n   - Now we've had our sixth tie in round 18 (both rock)\n\n6. Based on historical patterns after rock-rock ties (rounds 2-3, 9-10), they've played paper.\n\n7. Their overall pattern suggests a high likelihood of paper after rock.\n\n8. To counter paper, scissors would be my best move.\n\n9. However, they might anticipate this reasoning and play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n10. Given the strong historical pattern of them playing paper after rock, and specifically after rock-rock ties, I'll choose scissors:\n    - If they play paper (following their strong historical pattern), I win\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I lose\n    - If they play scissors, we tie\n\n11. This is a calculated risk based on their very consistent historical pattern of playing paper after rock, especially after rock-rock ties.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their pattern after rock is split between paper (4 times) and scissors (3 times), with rock only once.\n\n6. Given that they've played rock in the last round, they're more likely to play either paper or scissors next.\n\n7. Paper has historically been their slightly more common choice after rock.\n\n8. However, I've now won three rounds in a row, which might cause them to change their strategy.\n\n9.

After scissors-scissors ties in previous rounds:\n   - In round 14-15, they followed the scissors-scissors tie with scissors again\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after scissors more generally:\n   - They've followed scissors with paper in rounds 5-6, 11-12\n   - They've followed scissors with scissors in rounds 14-15, 15-16\n   - They've followed scissors with rock in rounds 17-18\n\n6. Their pattern after scissors is mixed, but they've never played rock immediately after a scissors-scissors tie.\n\n7. Given the previous scissors-scissors tie in rounds 14-15, they played scissors again in round 15. This might suggest they could play scissors again.\n\n8. However, they've also shown a tendency to play paper after scissors in other contexts.\n\n9. If they play scissors again, rock would be my best counter.\n\n10.

The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. After a scissors-scissors tie, they played paper rather than scissors (breaking the pattern from rounds 14-15).\n\n4. After playing paper in previous rounds:\n   - They've followed paper with rock in rounds 1-2, 3-4, 6-7, 10-11, 12-13, 19-20\n   - They've followed paper with paper in rounds 8-9\n   - They've followed paper with scissors in rounds 5-6\n\n5. Their strongest pattern is playing rock after paper (occurred 6 times out of 10 paper plays).\n\n6. Given that they just played paper, they're most likely to play rock next based on their historical pattern.\n\n7. To counter rock, paper would be my best move.\n\n8. However, I need to consider that they might be adapting their strategy as the game progresses.\n\n9. If they anticipate that I'll expect rock and play paper, they might play scissors to counter.\n\n10. Given their very strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper, and considering that this pattern has been consistent throughout the game, I'll choose paper:\n    - If they play rock (following their strongest historical pattern), I win\n    - If they play scissors (breaking their pattern to counter my expected paper), I lose\n    - If they play paper, we tie\n\n11. This is a calculated risk based on their very consistent historical pattern of playing rock after paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They played scissors after paper, breaking their most common pattern of playing rock after paper. This suggests they are adapting their strategy.\n\n4. After playing scissors in previous rounds:\n   - They've followed scissors with paper in rounds 5-6, 11-12\n   - They've followed scissors with scissors in rounds 14-15, 15-16\n   - They've followed scissors with rock in rounds 17-18\n\n5. Their pattern after scissors is mixed, but paper has been a common follow-up (2 out of 5 times).\n\n6. However, they might be aware that I'm analyzing their patterns and deliberately breaking them.\n\n7. If they play paper (following one of their patterns after scissors), scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. If they play rock (following another of their patterns after scissors), paper would be my best counter.\n\n9. If they play scissors again (repeating their move), rock would be my best counter.\n\n10.

The opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They played scissors instead of their usual paper after rock, breaking their most common pattern. This suggests they might be adapting their strategy.\n\n4. After scissors-scissors ties in previous rounds:\n   - In round 14-15, they followed the scissors-scissors tie with scissors again\n   - In round 23-24, they followed the scissors-scissors tie with paper\n\n5. Their pattern after scissors-scissors ties is mixed, with one instance of scissors and one instance of paper.\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after scissors more generally:\n   - They've followed scissors with paper in rounds 5-6, 11-12, 23-24\n   - They've followed scissors with scissors in rounds 14-15, 15-16\n   - They've followed scissors with rock in rounds 17-18, 25-26\n\n7. Their pattern after scissors is quite mixed, with paper (3 times), scissors (2 times), and rock (2 times) all being common.\n\n8. Given this mixed pattern, I need to consider all possibilities.\n\n9. If they play paper (following one of their patterns after scissors), scissors would be my best counter.\n\n10. If they play rock (following another of their patterns after scissors), paper would be my best counter.\n\n11. If they play scissors again (repeating their move), rock would be my best counter.\n\n12. Given their mixed pattern after scissors and the fact that they've been adapting their strategy, I'll choose rock:\n    - If they play scissors again, I win\n    - If they play paper, I lose\n    - If they play rock, we tie\n\n13. This is a calculated risk based on the observation that they might repeat scissors (as they did after the first scissors-scissors tie) or switch to a different move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
