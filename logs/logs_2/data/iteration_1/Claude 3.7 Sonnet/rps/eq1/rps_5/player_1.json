Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, studies suggest that in a first round with no prior information, rock is the most common choice among players (psychology suggests it feels \"strongest\").\n6. If my opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n7. On the other hand, if my opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might choose scissors.\n8.

My theory about mirroring was incorrect. After three consecutive matches where they mirrored my moves, they played scissors when I played paper.\n\n3. Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 9: They played rock (matching my rock)\n   - Round 10: They played scissors (matching my scissors)\n   - Round 11: They played rock (matching my rock)\n   - Round 12: They played scissors (beating my paper)\n\n4. This suggests they might have intentionally matched my moves for three rounds to establish a pattern, then broke it to win.\n\n5. Alternatively, they might now be playing what would beat what they expect me to play.\n\n6. After losing with paper against scissors, I need to reassess their possible strategy:\n   - They might return to matching my moves\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They might be playing what would beat their own previous move\n   - They might be playing what would beat my previous move\n\n7. If they're playing what would beat my previous move (paper), they would play scissors again.\n\n8. If they're playing what would beat their own previous move (scissors), they would play rock.\n\n9.

My opponent has beaten me with paper against rock twice in the last three rounds.\n\n4. I've played rock for the last four rounds, and my opponent seems to have adapted to this pattern.\n\n5. After winning with paper, many players would be tempted to stick with a winning move.\n\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll finally switch to scissors to counter their paper.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock.\n\n8. Given their recent success with paper and my predictable rock plays, there's a strong chance they'll play paper again, expecting me to stick with rock or anticipating that I might overthink and play rock to beat their expected scissors.\n\n9. However, I need to break my predictable pattern of playing rock repeatedly.\n\n10. Based on their recent success with paper against my rock, I think scissors is the best move to counter their likely paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Given our history, my opponent has shown the ability to anticipate my moves but has also resulted in ties recently.\n\n6.

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 24: I won with paper against rock\n   - Round 25: Tie with scissors\n   - Round 26: Tie with paper\n\n3. We've now had two consecutive ties with different moves (scissors, then paper).\n\n4. After a tie with paper, common responses include:\n   - Sticking with paper, expecting another tie\n   - Switching to scissors to beat the opponent's expected paper\n   - Switching to rock, anticipating the opponent will switch to scissors\n\n5. Given our recent history of consecutive ties, my opponent might be trying to establish a pattern or break out of the tie cycle.\n\n6. They might expect me to play scissors (to beat their paper), in which case they would play rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might expect me to play rock (thinking I'll anticipate their scissors), in which case they would play paper.\n\n8. Given the psychological dynamics after consecutive ties and the overall game history, I think they're more likely to play scissors, expecting me to play paper again or to counter my potential rock play.\n\n9. To counter their anticipated scissors move, rock would be the best choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock to counter their anticipated scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 25: Tie with scissors\n   - Round 26: Tie with paper\n   - Round 27: Tie with rock\n\n3. We've now had three consecutive ties with all three possible moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock).\n\n4. This is a remarkable pattern - it suggests my opponent might be deliberately matching my moves to force ties.\n\n5. After three consecutive ties with different moves, there are several possibilities:\n   - They might continue matching my move, resulting in another tie\n   - They might try to break the pattern by playing to win\n   - They might expect me to recognize the matching pattern and try to counter my counter-strategy\n\n6. If they're deliberately matching my moves, they would play whatever I play next.\n\n7. To break this pattern and win, I need to play a move that would lose to their expected move if they continue matching.\n\n8. If I play scissors and they match with scissors, it's another tie.\n   If I play paper and they match with paper, it's another tie.\n   If I play rock and they match with rock, it's another tie.\n\n9. However, if I play scissors expecting them to play paper (to beat my expected rock), I would win.\n\n10. Given the unusual pattern of three consecutive ties with different moves, I think the most strategic move is to play scissors, anticipating they might break the matching pattern and play paper (to beat my expected rock after our rock tie).\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors to counter their anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - Round 26: Tie with paper\n   - Round 27: Tie with rock\n   - Round 28: I won with scissors against paper\n\n3. I correctly predicted their paper move after three consecutive ties, which broke the tie streak.\n\n4. After losing with paper against scissors, common responses include:\n   - Switching to rock (to beat the scissors that just beat them)\n   - Sticking with paper (thinking I won't play scissors twice)\n   - Switching to scissors (to match what just beat them)\n\n5. Given the psychological dynamics after a loss that broke a streak of ties, they're most likely to switch to rock to counter my winning scissors move.\n\n6. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n7. However, they might also anticipate that I'll think this way and expect me to play paper, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n8. Given our history and the psychological dynamics after their loss, I think rock remains their most probable next move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper to counter their anticipated rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
