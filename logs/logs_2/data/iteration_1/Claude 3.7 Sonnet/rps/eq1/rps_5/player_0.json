Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at my opponent's behavior after ties:\n   - After the first scissors-scissors tie (Round 3), they played rock.\n   - After the rock-rock tie (Round 9), they played scissors.\n   - This suggests they might switch to a different move after ties.\n\n5. After two consecutive ties, there's a psychological tendency for players to try to break the pattern with a definitive move.\n\n6. Examining their overall pattern, my opponent has played:\n   - Rock: 4 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n   - Scissors: 4 times\n   This shows a preference for rock and scissors over paper.\n\n7. Given that we just tied with scissors, common psychology suggests:\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (to beat their scissors)\n   - If they anticipate this, they might play paper to counter\n\n8. Alternatively, they might use a \"rotation\" strategy after ties, moving from scissors to paper.\n\n9. If I believe they'll play paper next (either to counter my anticipated rock or as part of a rotation), scissors would lose.\n\n10. The optimal counter to their anticipated paper would be scissors, but since we just tied with scissors, this seems unlikely to be their choice.\n\n11. Given the psychological dynamics after consecutive ties and their observed patterns, rock seems like the strongest move - it would beat scissors if they stick with it, and it would counter their potential switch to scissors after our tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The three consecutive ties suggest my opponent might be deliberately matching my moves or using a sophisticated prediction strategy.\n\n5. After multiple ties, there's often a strong psychological impulse to break the pattern with a different move.\n\n6. Looking at the sequence of ties:\n   - After rock-rock tie, we both played scissors.\n   - After scissors-scissors tie, we both played rock.\n   - This suggests a potential pattern of switching after ties.\n\n7. Given that we just tied with rock, there's a high probability we'll both try to switch to a different move.\n\n8. The most direct switch from rock would be to paper (which beats rock).\n\n9. However, if my opponent anticipates I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors.\n\n10. Considering this recursive reasoning and the pattern of multiple ties, I need to break this cycle.\n\n11. Since we've just had a rock-rock tie and previously had a scissors-scissors tie, paper is the only move we haven't tied with recently.\n\n12. If my opponent follows the pattern of switching after ties, they might choose paper. If they anticipate I'll choose paper, they might choose scissors.\n\n13. Given these considerations and the need to break the tie streak, scissors seems like the optimal move - it would beat paper if they switch to that, and it disrupts the recent pattern of ties.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

A common reaction after losing is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's move. Since I played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n7. Another common strategy is to play what would have beaten their own previous move. Since they played paper, they might play scissors next.\n\n8. Given their recent pattern of cycling through moves (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), the next move in their sequence would logically be scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors next, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n10.

We've had another rock-rock tie, which is the 6th tie of the game and the 5th rock-rock tie specifically.\n\n3. My opponent's full sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: rock\n   This shows they've played rock in three consecutive rounds.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 11 times (61%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (17%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (22%)\n   Their preference for rock continues to strengthen significantly.\n\n6. After rock-rock ties, their next moves have been:\n   - After Round 9 tie: scissors\n   - After Round 11 tie: paper\n   - After Round 13 tie: rock\n   - After Round 16 tie: rock\n   There's no consistent pattern, but they've played rock after the two most recent rock-rock ties.\n\n7. Their extremely strong preference for rock (11 out of 18 moves) suggests they might play rock again.\n\n8. After multiple consecutive rock plays and ties, there's psychological pressure to switch to break the pattern.\n\n9. Given their historical behavior:\n   - They might stick with rock due to their strong preference\n   - They might switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock again\n   - They might switch to scissors anticipating I'll switch to paper\n\n10. Considering their overwhelming preference for rock and the recent sequence of rock plays, paper seems like the optimal move - it would beat rock if they play it again (which they do most often), and it's the logical counter to their most frequent choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: rock\n   This shows they've played rock in four consecutive rounds.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 12 times (63%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (16%)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (21%)\n   Their preference for rock has become extremely pronounced.\n\n6. After losing with rock:\n   - After losing with rock in Round 1, they played scissors.\n   - After losing with rock in Round 4, they played paper.\n   - After losing with rock in Round 17, they played rock again.\n   There's no consistent pattern, but most recently they stuck with rock after losing with it.\n\n7. After consecutive losses with the same move, players often switch strategies.\n\n8. Given that they've now lost twice in a row with rock, they might:\n   - Finally switch away from rock after four consecutive rock plays\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Switch to paper to try something completely different\n\n9. The most logical response after losing twice to paper would be to play scissors.\n\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n11. Given their historical patterns (strong preference for rock) balanced against the psychological pressure to change after consecutive losses, rock seems like the strongest move - it would beat scissors if they finally switch, and it disrupts the current dynamic of me playing paper against their rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Common strategies after losing include:\n   - Switching to what would have beaten the opponent's move (paper would beat my rock)\n   - Switching to what the opponent just played (rock)\n   - Sticking with the current move hoping for better luck (scissors)\n\n8.

After ties in general:\n   - They've shown a tendency to switch moves after ties\n   - After scissors-scissors ties, they've played rock and paper\n   - After rock-rock ties, they've played scissors, paper, rock, and rock\n\n7. After a paper-paper tie specifically, we have no historical data since this is the first one.\n\n8. Common psychology after ties suggests players often switch to a different move.\n\n9.

Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - Round 22: rock\n   - Round 23: scissors\n   - Round 24: paper\n   This shows they've now played paper twice in the last four rounds.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 13 times (54%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (21%)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (25%)\n   Their preference for rock remains strong, but paper and scissors usage has increased.\n\n6. After winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in Round 5, they played rock.\n   - After winning with paper in Round 8, they played rock.\n   - After winning with paper in Round 24, we're now looking for their next move.\n   There's a pattern of switching to rock after winning with paper.\n\n7. After consecutive wins:\n   - After Rounds 6-7 (winning with rock then scissors): they played paper.\n   - After Rounds 23-24 (winning with scissors then paper): we're now looking for their next move.\n\n8. Given their historical patterns and recent success, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (following their pattern after winning with paper)\n   - Stick with paper (win-stay strategy)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper)\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\n10. If they stick with paper, scissors would be my optimal counter.\n\n11. If they switch to scissors, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n12. Considering their historical pattern of switching to rock after winning with paper, and their overall preference for rock, scissors seems like the strongest move - it would beat paper if they stick with it, and it would at least tie against scissors if they switch to that instead.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

After winning with scissors:\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 7, they played paper.\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 15, they played rock.\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 23, they played paper.\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 28, we're now looking for their next move.\n   There's no consistent pattern, but they've played paper twice and rock once after winning with scissors.\n\n7. Common strategies after winning include:\n   - Sticking with the winning move (\"win-stay\" strategy)\n   - Anticipating the opponent will switch to counter the previous move, and countering that\n   - Following a rotation pattern\n\n8.

My opponent's full sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.\n\n4. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Round 26: paper\n   - Round 27: rock\n   - Round 28: scissors\n   - Round 29: paper\n   This shows they've now cycled through all three moves and returned to paper.\n\n5. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 14 times (48%)\n   - Paper: 7 times (24%)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (28%)\n   Their preference for rock remains strong, but paper and scissors usage has increased.\n\n6. After winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in Round 5, they played rock.\n   - After winning with paper in Round 8, they played rock.\n   - After winning with paper in Round 24, they played scissors.\n   - After winning with paper in Round 29, we're now looking for their next move.\n   There's no consistent pattern in their behavior after winning with paper.\n\n7. After consecutive wins:\n   - After Rounds 5-8 (winning with paper, rock, scissors, paper): they played rock.\n   - After Rounds 23-24 (winning with scissors, paper): they played scissors.\n   - After Rounds 28-29 (winning with scissors, paper): we're now looking for their next move.\n\n8. Given their historical patterns and recent success, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (as they've done most often after winning with paper)\n   - Stick with paper (win-stay strategy)\n   - Switch to scissors (following their recent cycling pattern)\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\n10. If they stick with paper, scissors would be my optimal counter.\n\n11. If they switch to scissors, rock would be my optimal counter.\n\n12. Considering their historical behavior after winning with paper (switching to rock most often) and the need to break my losing streak, scissors seems like the strongest move - it would beat paper if they stick with it, and it would at least tie against scissors if they follow their recent cycling pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
