    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, their pattern shows an unusual commitment to scissors, suggesting they might continue with it.\n\n9. Given their historical behavior and apparent aversion to rock, they're most likely to either play scissors again or switch to paper.\n\n10. Since they've played scissors so frequently and just tied with it, I believe they're more likely to switch to paper.\n\n11.

They've now played rock five times in a row, losing twice, winning twice, and tying once.\n\n4. Their pattern now shows 4 papers, 11 scissors, and 5 rocks.\n\n5. Their behavior shows two distinct phases: first a strong preference for scissors, and now a strong preference for rock.\n\n6. After losing with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with rock despite the loss (showing commitment to their new pattern)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my potential paper play)\n   - Try paper (which they haven't played for many rounds)\n\n7. Given that they've lost with rock twice now when I played paper, there's an increased probability they'll switch.\n\n8. Their historical behavior shows they can stick with a move for many rounds (like scissors), but will eventually change when it stops working.\n\n9. Since I've successfully countered their rock twice with paper, they're likely expecting me to play paper again.\n\n10. If they expect me to play paper, their optimal move would be scissors.\n\n11. Considering these factors, especially their likely expectation that I'll play paper again, I believe they're most likely to switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After tying with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (showing continued commitment)\n   - Switch to paper (to try to beat my potential rock play)\n   - Switch to scissors (their historically preferred move)\n\n7. Given that we just tied with rock, there's an increased probability they'll switch to try to gain an advantage.\n\n8. After a tie, many players will switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move, which would be paper.\n\n9. Additionally, they may be noticing that I'm adapting to their pattern and might try to break their own pattern.\n\n10.

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\n3. They've now played rock twelve times in a row, with 4 wins, 4 losses, and 4 ties.\n\n4. Their pattern now shows 4 papers, 11 scissors, and 12 rocks.\n\n5. After tying with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (showing continued extreme commitment)\n   - Switch to paper (to try to beat my potential rock play)\n   - Switch to scissors (to return to their earlier preferred move)\n\n6. Given that we just tied with rock, there's an increased probability they'll switch to try to gain an advantage.\n\n7. After a tie, many players will switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move, which would be paper.\n\n8. However, their historical behavior shows extreme commitment to a single move (11 scissors, now 12 rocks), suggesting they might continue with rock.\n\n9. They've now played rock for more consecutive rounds (12) than they played scissors (11), establishing a new pattern of commitment.\n\n10. Considering their demonstrated extreme commitment to a single move regardless of results, I believe they're more likely to continue with rock than to switch.\n\n11. To counter their likely rock play, I should play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played rock thirteen times in a row, with 4 wins, 5 losses, and 4 ties.\n\n4. Their pattern now shows 4 papers, 11 scissors, and 13 rocks.\n\n5. After losing with rock against my paper again, they might:\n   - Continue with rock despite another loss (showing remarkable commitment)\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat my potential paper play)\n   - Try paper (which they haven't played for many rounds)\n\n6. Given that they've lost with rock five times now when I played paper, there's an increased probability they'll finally switch.\n\n7. Their historical behavior shows extreme commitment to a single move (11 scissors, now 13 rocks), but they did eventually switch from scissors to rock.\n\n8. Since I've successfully countered their rock five times with paper, they're very likely expecting me to play paper again.\n\n9. If they expect me to play paper, their optimal move would be scissors.\n\n10. They've now played rock for more consecutive rounds (13) than they played scissors (11), and have lost with it more times (5) than they lost with scissors before switching.\n\n11. Considering these factors, especially their likely expectation that I'll play paper again after it worked so well, and the increased number of losses with rock, I believe they're more likely to finally switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've finally broken their rock streak after 13 consecutive plays, switching to scissors but losing.\n\n4. Their pattern now shows 4 papers, 12 scissors, and 13 rocks.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch back to rock (their most recent long-term strategy)\n   - Continue with scissors despite the loss\n   - Try paper (which they haven't played for many rounds)\n\n6. Their historical behavior shows they can stick with a move even after losing with it initially.\n\n7. However, they've shown a pattern of eventually abandoning strategies that lose too many times.\n\n8. Since they just broke a very long streak of playing rock, it seems unlikely they would immediately return to it.\n\n9. Given that they've just switched to scissors after a long rock streak, there's a good chance they might try to establish a new pattern with scissors.\n\n10. If they continue with scissors, I should play rock to counter.\n\n11. If they switch to paper (anticipating my rock to counter their scissors), I should play scissors.\n\n12. If they return to rock, I should play paper.\n\n13. Balancing these possibilities and considering their historical pattern of sticking with a move for multiple rounds, I believe they're more likely to continue with scissors despite losing with it.\n\n[move] rock\n"
