    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since paper has the highest potential reward (+3), it might be tempting to play it.\n4. However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n5.

Their pattern has become quite clear now:\n   - In their last 6 moves, they've followed a perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle\n   - They just played paper, so following this pattern, they would play rock next\n\n4. My prediction in the last round was accurate - they did indeed play paper after scissors.\n\n5. If they continue their pattern and play rock next, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n6. However, they might recognize that their pattern has become predictable and deliberately break it.\n\n7. If they expect me to anticipate rock and play paper, they might play scissors instead.\n\n8. But breaking an established pattern is psychologically difficult, and the evidence suggests they are following a consistent strategy.\n\n9. The highest reward comes from correctly predicting they'll play rock and countering with paper (+3 points).\n\n10. Given their strong pattern adherence over the last 6 rounds, I believe they are likely to continue with rock next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observations:\n   - My prediction was correct - they played scissors and I countered with rock\n   - I've now won with rock against their scissors twice in a row (rounds 14 and 17)\n   - Their last five moves have been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors in rounds 14 and 17\n   - Looking at their pattern after I play rock and win: when I won with rock in round 14, they played paper in the next round\n\n4. After I played rock and beat their scissors, they might:\n   a) Switch to paper to counter my potential rock play again (this is what they did after I won with rock in round 14)\n   b) Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their potential paper\n   c) Stay with scissors if they think I'll play paper to avoid another rock play\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - They've now beaten me 3 rounds in a row\n   - They switched from rock to scissors as I predicted, but I incorrectly played paper\n   - Their last several moves show a pattern of alternating between rock and scissors\n   - They've now beaten my paper with scissors three times (rounds 9, 11, and 19)\n   - I've lost 6 of the last 7 rounds\n\n4.

Key observations:\n   - I've now lost 4 rounds in a row\n   - They broke their recent rock-scissors alternation pattern by playing paper\n   - Their last several moves are: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've now beaten my rock with paper four times (rounds 1, 4, 12, and 20)\n   - I need to break this losing streak\n\n4. After playing paper and beating my rock, they might:\n   a) Stay with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - I successfully broke my losing streak with paper beating their rock\n   - My prediction about them playing rock after paper was correct\n   - I've now won with paper against their rock three times (rounds 3, 5, and 21)\n   - Their last several moves are: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. After I played paper and beat their rock, they might:\n   a) Switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play again\n   b) Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors\n   c) Stay with rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their potential paper\n\n5. Looking at what happened previously when I won with paper:\n   - After I won with paper in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After I won with paper in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n\n   This suggests they might play either paper or scissors after losing to my paper.\n\n6. Also looking at their pattern after they play rock:\n   - After rock in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After rock in round 8, they played scissors in round 9\n   - After rock in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After rock in round 16, they played scissors in round 17\n   - After rock in round 18, they played scissors in round 19\n\n   This suggests they're much more likely to play scissors after rock (5 out of 6 times).\n\n7. Given both these patterns, scissors seems like their most likely next move.\n\n8. If they play scissors as predicted, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. If I'm wrong and they play rock again, I would tie with rock.\n\n10. If I'm wrong and they play paper, I would lose 3 points with rock.\n\n11. Given their strong tendency to play scissors after rock, and the possibility of at least a tie if they play rock, I'll choose rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key observations:\n   - They played paper instead of scissors, contrary to my prediction\n   - They've now beaten my rock with paper five times (rounds 1, 4, 12, 20, and 22)\n   - Their last several moves are: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - I notice they've never played scissors after paper in the last several rounds\n\n4. After playing paper and beating my rock, they might:\n   a) Stay with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   b) Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   c) Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after they play paper:\n   - After paper in round 1, they played scissors in round 2\n   - After paper in round 4, they played rock in round 5\n   - After paper in round 7, they played rock in round 8\n   - After paper in round 10, they played scissors in round 11\n   - After paper in round 12, they played rock in round 13\n   - After paper in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After paper in round 20, they played rock in round 21\n\n   This suggests they're more likely to play rock after paper (5 out of 7 times).\n\n6. If they play rock as their pattern suggests, my best response would be paper (+3 points).\n\n7. However, they might also be aware of this pattern and deliberately break it.\n\n8. Given that they've beaten my rock with paper multiple times, they might expect me to avoid rock.\n\n9. If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their potential paper), they would likely play rock.\n\n10. If they expect me to play paper (to counter their potential rock), they would likely play scissors.\n\n11. Given their strong tendency to play rock after paper, and my need to recover from my recent loss, I'll choose paper for the potential higher reward (+3 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observations:\n   - My prediction was correct - they played rock and I countered with paper\n   - I've now won with paper against their rock four times (rounds 3, 5, 21, and 23)\n   - Their last several moves are: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They're showing a pattern of alternating between paper and rock in the last few rounds\n\n4. After I played paper and beat their rock, they might:\n   a) Switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play again\n   b) Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors\n   c) Stay with rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their potential paper\n\n5. Looking at what happened previously when I won with paper:\n   - After I won with paper in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After I won with paper in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After I won with paper in round 21, they played paper in round 22\n\n   This shows varied responses, but paper is slightly more common.\n\n6. Also looking at their pattern after they play rock:\n   - After rock in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After rock in round 8, they played scissors in round 9\n   - After rock in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After rock in round 16, they played scissors in round 17\n   - After rock in round 18, they played scissors in round 19\n   - After rock in round 21, they played paper in round 22\n\n   This suggests they're likely to play scissors after rock (5 out of 7 times).\n\n7. However, their most recent pattern shows alternation between paper and rock, suggesting they might play paper next.\n\n8. If they play scissors as their historical pattern suggests, my best response would be rock (+1 point).\n\n9. If they play paper as their recent alternating pattern suggests, my best response would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. Given the conflict between their historical pattern and recent pattern, and considering that scissors would be effective against their potential paper play, I'll choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After I played paper and beat their rock, they might:\n   a) Switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play again\n   b) Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors\n   c) Stay with rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their potential paper\n\n5. Looking at what happened previously when I won with paper:\n   - After I won with paper in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After I won with paper in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After I won with paper in round 21, they played paper in round 22\n   - After I won with paper in round 23, they played paper in round 24\n\n   This suggests they're more likely to play paper after losing to my paper (3 out of 4 times).\n\n6. Also looking at their pattern after they play rock:\n   - After rock in round 3, they played paper in round 4\n   - After rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - After rock in round 8, they played scissors in round 9\n   - After rock in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After rock in round 16, they played scissors in round 17\n   - After rock in round 18, they played scissors in round 19\n   - After rock in round 21, they played paper in round 22\n   - After rock in round 23, they played paper in round 24\n\n   This suggests they're slightly more likely to play scissors after rock (5 out of 8 times).\n\n7. Given my recent success with paper, they might expect me to play paper again.\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would likely play scissors to counter it.\n\n9. To counter their potential scissors play, rock would be my best move (+1 point).\n\n10. If I'm wrong and they play paper, I would lose 3 points with rock.\n\n11. If I'm wrong and they play rock, I would tie with rock.\n\n12. Given their tendency to play paper after losing to my paper, and scissors after playing rock, rock seems like a balanced choice with the potential to win and the safety of at least tying if they play rock again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
