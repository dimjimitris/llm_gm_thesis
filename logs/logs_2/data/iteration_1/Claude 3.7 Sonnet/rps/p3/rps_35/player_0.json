Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n5. Rock and scissors both have lower risk and reward (+1/-1).\n6. Without knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, I should consider what most players might choose in the first round.\n7. Many players tend to choose rock in the first round as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\".\n8. If I expect rock to be a common first move, paper would be the optimal counter.\n9.

In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie.\n2. This gives me some information about my opponent's strategy - they chose paper in the first round.\n3. Let me consider what my opponent might be thinking now:\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper again (some players repeat moves after ties)\n   - They might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper)\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (if they think I'm making a random change)\n4. If my opponent is strategic, they're most likely to choose rock to counter the scissors they expect me to play.\n5. If they choose rock, my best response would be paper.\n6. However, they might anticipate this and choose scissors instead.\n7. This is starting to look like a second-level reasoning problem.\n8. Given that the payoff for correctly playing paper against rock is higher (+3 points) than other winning combinations (+1 point), and my opponent has already shown a willingness to play paper, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock to counter what they expect from me.\n9. Therefore, I'll choose paper again, which would give me the highest payoff if they indeed switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this second round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has shown a pattern: they started with paper, then switched to scissors.\n3. This suggests they might be adapting to counter my previous moves.\n4. After beating my paper with scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors expecting me to play paper again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their previous move\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n5.

I've now won eleven consecutive rounds! My strategy continues to be remarkably effective.\n\n4. Looking at the most recent rounds, my opponent has continued their rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle with remarkable consistency.\n\n5. After losing to my rock with their scissors, if they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n6. After eleven consecutive losses, my opponent might:\n   - Continue their cyclical pattern, seemingly unable to break out of it\n   - Finally realize the pattern and try something different\n   - Be completely frustrated and make a random choice\n\n7. However, given the strong consistency of their pattern throughout the entire game, there's a high probability they will continue with paper.\n\n8. If they play paper (continuing their cycle), scissors would be my best response.\n9. If they play scissors again, rock would win again.\n10. If they play rock (breaking their cycle), paper would win.\n\n11. Given their unwavering adherence to the pattern so far and my continued success at predicting it, the most likely move from them is paper.\n\n12. Therefore, scissors would be my best move to counter their expected paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this eighteenth round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's update the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 26: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 27: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 28: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now won twenty-two consecutive rounds! My strategy of predicting their cyclical pattern has been extraordinarily successful.\n\n4. Looking at the recent rounds, my opponent has continued their perfect rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle without any deviation.\n\n5. After losing to my paper with their rock, if they continue this established pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. After twenty-two consecutive losses, my opponent might:\n   - Continue their cyclical pattern, seemingly locked into it\n   - Finally break the pattern out of extreme frustration\n   - Make a completely unexpected move\n\n7. However, given the extraordinary consistency of their pattern throughout the entire game, there's a very high probability they will continue with scissors.\n\n8. If they play scissors (continuing their cycle), rock would be my best response.\n9. If they play rock again, paper would win again.\n10. If they play paper (breaking their cycle), scissors would win.\n\n11. Given their unwavering adherence to the pattern so far and my continued success at predicting it, the most likely move from them is scissors.\n\n12. Therefore, rock would be my best move to counter their expected scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this twenty-ninth round.\n\n[move] rock\n"
