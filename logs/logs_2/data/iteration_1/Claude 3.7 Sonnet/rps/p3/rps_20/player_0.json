    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their pattern is becoming harder to predict, but they seem to favor paper (2 times) and rock (2 times) over scissors (1 time).\n\nSince they just played paper, they might:\n1. Play scissors next if they're following a paper \u2192 scissors sequence\n2. Play rock if they're trying to counter my expected scissors (which would counter their paper)\n3. Play paper again if they're trying to match or confuse me\n\nGiven that they rarely play scissors based on our history, and the most common follow-up to paper in standard RPS psychology is rock, I'll anticipate rock and play paper again.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played scissors after paper twice (rounds 27 and 29), suggesting they might be establishing a new pattern.\n\nSince they just played scissors, and considering standard RPS psychology where scissors is often followed by rock (as rock beats scissors), they might play rock next.\n\nTo counter their expected rock move, I should play paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
