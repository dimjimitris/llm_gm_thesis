I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any information about their past behavior or patterns.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, without prior information, all three options are equally viable.\n3. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: I get +1 point if I win, -1 if I lose\n   - Paper beats rock: I get +3 points if I win, -3 if I lose\n   - Scissors beats paper: I get +1 point if I win, -1 if I lose\n4. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3).\n5. Rock and scissors both have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1).\n6. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent, I should consider that many players tend to choose rock as their first move.\n7. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get the maximum possible points (+3).\n8. The risk is worth taking in this first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I have some information now: in the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock. I won and earned 3 points.\n2. My opponent might be thinking about changing their strategy after losing. There are a few possibilities to consider:\n   - They might stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect that\n   - They might switch to paper, expecting me to play rock\n   - They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n3. The most logical move for my opponent would be to switch to scissors, anticipating that I might play paper again after my success.\n4. If they play scissors and I play paper, I would lose 1 point.\n5. If they play scissors and I play rock, I would win 1 point.\n6. Given this reasoning, playing rock seems like a good counter-strategy.\n7. However, they might also think I would switch to rock, and thus they might play paper.\n8.

They might expect me to play paper again after my successful win, so they might switch to scissors.\n5. They could also switch back to paper, thinking I might play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n6. They could also stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect them to play the same move after losing.\n7. Given their previous pattern of sticking with the same move multiple times, there's a chance they'll play rock again.\n8. However, the most logical move after losing would be to switch to scissors to counter my expected paper.\n9. If they play scissors and I play rock, I would win 1 point.\n10. If they play rock again and I play paper, I would win 3 points.\n11. If they switch to paper and I play scissors, I would win 1 point.\n12. Rock would be the safest counter to their expected scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll switch to scissors to counter my previous paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they switch to paper and I play scissors, I would win 1 point.\n8. If they switch to scissors and I play rock, I would win 1 point.\n9.

Let's analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 26: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 28: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n2. I've now won 16 rounds in a row, and my opponent has lost with paper.\n3. My opponent switched to paper as predicted, but lost again.\n4. After losing with paper, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to beat my expected scissors\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I might play paper anticipating their rock\n   - Continue with paper, though this seems extremely unlikely\n5. Given their continued losses and my perfect prediction record, they might be completely frustrated and potentially making random choices.\n6. However, the most direct and logical response to their recent loss would be to play rock to counter my successful scissors.\n7. If they play rock and I play paper, I would win 3 points.\n8. If they play scissors and I play rock, I would win 1 point.\n9. If they somehow play paper again and I play scissors, I would win 1 point.\n10. Paper would be the best counter to their expected rock play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they'll switch to rock to counter my previous successful scissors play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
