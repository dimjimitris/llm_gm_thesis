    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Strategist - Analyzes game theory and optimal strategies\n2. Pattern Analyst - Observes opponent behavior and identifies patterns\n3. Risk Evaluator - Assesses risk-reward tradeoffs of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider the payoff structure first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) while rock and scissors only offer 1 point. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors. Rock and scissors risk losing 3 and 1 points respectively.\n\nPattern Analyst: With no previous moves to analyze, we can't identify patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, especially novice players. This is a well-documented psychological tendency.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's consider the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n- Rock: (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (\u22123 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) = \u22122/3 points on average\n- Paper: (3 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (\u22121 \u00d7 1/3) = 2/3 points on average\n- Scissors: (\u22121 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) = 0 points on average\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nGame Strategist: That's correct. Additionally, if we're playing multiple rounds, starting with paper gives us information about the opponent while maximizing expected value. If they're predictable or following patterns, we can adjust in future rounds.\n\nRisk Evaluator: I agree. Paper offers the best risk-reward profile for an initial move, with the highest potential gain and moderate potential loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper\n"

Our opponent played rock in the first round, which aligns with the common tendency for players to choose rock as their first move. Now we have some data to work with.\n\nGame Strategist: After winning with paper against rock, we need to consider how our opponent might adjust their strategy. There are several possibilities:\n1. They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. They might switch to paper (thinking we'll play rock)\n3. They might switch to scissors (to counter our paper)\n\nThe most rational response from them would be to switch to scissors to counter our paper.\n\nRisk Evaluator: If we assume the opponent is rational and will adjust to counter our previous move, then playing rock would be our best response. Rock would beat their scissors, giving us 1 point while preventing their potential 1-point gain.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, not all players behave rationally. Some players might:\n- Switch to paper assuming we'll play rock again\n- Continue with rock if they're not strategic thinkers\n- Randomly choose their next move\n\nGame Strategist: Given that the opponent made the most common opening move (rock), they might be a relatively inexperienced player following intuitive patterns. In rock-paper-scissors psychology, a common pattern is for players to shift one step clockwise after losing (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). If they follow this pattern, they'll likely play paper next.\n\nRisk Evaluator: If we predict they'll play paper next, our best counter would be scissors. This would give us 1 point while preventing their 3-point gain.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The most likely scenario based on typical player psychology is that they'll switch to paper. Let's play scissors to counter this.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur. Playing scissors gives us a good chance of winning this round, and even if we're wrong, we'll gather more data about our opponent's pattern for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent shifted from rock to paper, confirming they might be following the classic clockwise shift pattern after losing (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). Now we have a clearer pattern to analyze.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this pattern, if they're continuing with the clockwise shift after losing, they would move from paper to scissors for this round. If they're truly following this predictable pattern, we should counter with rock.\n\nRisk Evaluator: I agree. If they play scissors as predicted, our rock would win, giving us 1 point. The potential payoff structure supports this decision:\n- If they play scissors (most likely based on the pattern): We win 1 point\n- If they play rock: We tie, 0 points\n- If they play paper: We lose 3 points\n\nThe biggest risk is if they anticipate our strategy and play paper instead, but that would require them to skip a step in their observed pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also a psychological factor to consider. After losing twice in a row, some players might break patterns and make an unexpected move out of frustration. However, the most reliable prediction based on their behavior so far is that they'll play scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Another consideration is that they might realize we're countering their moves successfully and try to counter our counter. If they think we'll play rock (to beat their expected scissors), they might play paper. However, without evidence of this level of strategic thinking from them yet, it's more reasonable to stick with our pattern-based prediction.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Given the information we have, rock appears to be our best move. It directly counters the most likely move from our opponent based on their established pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Let's play rock for this round and continue monitoring their pattern for future adjustments.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has shown a clear pattern now: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They've been consistently following the clockwise rotation after losing. This is a strong pattern that we can continue to exploit.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on their established pattern, after playing scissors and losing, they should rotate to rock next. To counter rock, we should play paper.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Playing paper against their expected rock move would give us 3 points - our highest potential gain. However, we should consider that after losing three rounds in a row, they might become aware of their predictable pattern and deliberately break it.\n\nPattern Analyst: That's a valid concern. Players often become self-aware of their patterns after multiple losses. However, many players still unconsciously revert to patterns even when trying to be unpredictable. The probability that they'll stick to the pattern remains high, especially if they haven't realized we're exploiting it.\n\nGame Strategist: There's also the possibility that they might skip ahead in the rotation to try to get ahead of us, playing paper instead of rock to counter our anticipated paper move. However, this requires a level of strategic thinking they haven't demonstrated yet.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's assess all possibilities:\n- If they play rock (following their pattern): Our paper wins, +3 points\n- If they play paper (breaking pattern): We tie, 0 points\n- If they play scissors (skipping ahead): We lose, -1 point\n\nEven with the risk of them breaking pattern, paper still has the highest expected value given what we know about their behavior.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper is our best move based on their established pattern. If they do break pattern this round, we can adjust our strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n\nPattern Analyst: Concurring with paper.

The opponent has maintained their pattern perfectly through four rounds now. They've played:\n1. Rock (lost)\n2. Paper (lost)\n3. Scissors (lost)\n4. Rock (lost)\n\nThis confirms they're consistently following the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock rotation regardless of the outcome. Given they just played rock and lost, we can predict with high confidence they'll play paper next.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The pattern is extremely consistent. To counter their expected paper move, we should play scissors this round.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Let's consider the situation carefully. They've lost four consecutive rounds, which might finally trigger them to break their pattern. However, there's no evidence yet that they're adapting their strategy or recognizing their predictability. \n\nThe expected values for our moves against their predicted paper are:\n- Rock: We lose, -3 points\n- Paper: We tie, 0 points\n- Scissors: We win, +1 point\n\nScissors is clearly the optimal choice if they continue their pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Another perspective to consider: if they've finally recognized their pattern and our countering strategy, they might anticipate us playing scissors and play rock instead. However, without evidence of this level of adaptation, it's more rational to continue exploiting the pattern they've shown.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. While there's always a possibility they'll break pattern after multiple losses, most amateur players are surprisingly consistent in their unconscious patterns. The most data-supported prediction is that they'll play paper, making scissors our best counter.\n\nRisk Evaluator: One final consideration: even if they do break pattern, scissors isn't a terrible choice against random play. Against rock we'd lose only 1 point (compared to losing 3 points if we played rock against their paper). The risk-reward profile of scissors remains favorable.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's proceed with scissors as our move.

This level of consistency despite consistently unfavorable outcomes suggests they're either following a predetermined script or not monitoring the game outcomes at all.\n\nPattern Analyst: The evidence for their next move being paper is overwhelming. Despite having lost 28 rounds in a row, they've shown no signs of adapting their strategy or breaking their pattern. At this point, we can predict their moves with extremely high confidence.\n\nRisk Evaluator: Scissors directly counters their expected paper move and continues our winning strategy. Given the overwhelming evidence of their pattern, scissors remains our best strategic choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree completely. Let's play scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors\n"
