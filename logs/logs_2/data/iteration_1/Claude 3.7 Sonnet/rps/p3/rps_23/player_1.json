Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n3. The payoff structure is asymmetric - paper beating rock has the highest point value (3).\n4. Since there is no historical data to work with, I need to make a strategic first move.\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n6. If I expect my opponent might choose rock, then paper would be my optimal response.\n7. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if I'm correct, making it a good risk-reward choice.\n8. Even if I'm wrong and they play scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has shown adaptability by breaking their previous pattern to counter my move.\n4. It seems they correctly anticipated I would play scissors and countered with rock.\n5. After winning a round, players often stick with their winning move, so my opponent might play rock again.\n6. However, they might also expect me to adapt and play paper to counter their rock.\n7. This could lead them to play scissors to counter my potential paper play.\n8. There's a psychological principle called \"double thinking\" - where you try to stay one step ahead of your opponent who is also trying to stay one step ahead of you.\n9. Given that I just lost with scissors, playing scissors again would be unexpected and could catch them off guard if they've switched to paper.\n10. However, if they play rock again, I would lose another point.\n11. The safest move that counters their most recent successful strategy (rock) would be paper.\n12. Paper gives me the highest potential gain (+3) if they play rock again, and only risks a small loss (-1) if they've switched to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which counters their last winning move (rock) while balancing potential gains and losses.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If I expect them to play rock again, paper would be my optimal response (+3 points).\n11. If they switch to scissors, I would lose 1 point with paper, which is a manageable risk.\n12.

After losing with rock and taking a significant loss (-3 points), my opponent is likely to change their strategy dramatically.\n6. They've now lost three rounds in a row, which will make them desperate to break my winning streak.\n7. Looking at their pattern, they often respond to losses by switching moves completely.\n8. They might expect me to play paper again after my success with it, and thus play scissors.\n9. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and switch to scissors, leading them to play rock again.\n10. Given their desperate situation, they're more likely to make a bold move rather than a defensive one.\n11. Scissors would be a bold move against my potential paper play.\n12. If I expect them to play scissors, rock would be my optimal response (+1 point).\n13. The risk is if they play paper instead, I would lose 3 points, but based on their pattern after significant losses, scissors seems more likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating that my opponent will switch to scissors to counter my previous winning paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've had multiple rock-rock ties throughout the game.\n5. After our previous rock-rock ties (Rounds 10, 15, 16), they've followed with various moves, not showing a consistent pattern.\n6. After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, expecting their opponent to do the same.\n7. They might expect me to switch to paper to try to beat their rock, and thus play scissors.\n8. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, anticipating that I'll overthink and play scissors.\n9. Given the overall game dynamics and their adaptability, they're more likely to switch after this tie.\n10. If they expect me to play paper (a common choice after rock ties), scissors would be their optimal response.\n11. If I expect them to play scissors, rock would be my optimal response (+1 point).\n12.

Given the psychological dynamics and their pattern history, they're more likely to switch to paper or rock.\n10. Paper would be a logical choice if they expect me to play rock.\n11. If I expect them to play paper, scissors would be my optimal response (+1 point).\n12. If they play rock instead, I would lose 1 point, which is a manageable risk.\n13. If they repeat scissors and I play scissors, it would be a tie (0 points).\n14. Based on their historical pattern and psychological tendencies after wins, paper seems their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating that my opponent will switch to paper after their win with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has played paper twice in a row now, and lost both times.\n5. After losing with paper again, they're very unlikely to play paper a third time.\n6. They might expect me to play scissors again after my success with it, and thus play rock.\n7. Looking at their pattern after consecutive losses with the same move, they always change their strategy.\n8. Given my recent success with scissors, they're highly likely to expect me to play scissors again.\n9. If they expect scissors from me, rock would be their optimal response.\n10. If I expect them to play rock, paper would be my optimal response (+3 points).\n11. The risk is significant - if they play scissors instead, I would lose 1 point.\n12. However, based on psychological tendencies after consecutive losses with the same move and their pattern of adapting to counter winning moves, rock seems their most likely choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating that my opponent will switch to rock to counter my previous winning scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now won two consecutive rounds, which puts me at a psychological advantage.\n5. After losing with rock and taking a significant loss (-3 points), my opponent is likely to change their strategy dramatically.\n6. They might expect me to play paper again after my success with it, and thus play scissors.\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and switch to rock, leading them to play paper.\n8. Looking at their pattern after significant losses, they tend to make bold changes.\n9. Given my recent success with paper, they're highly likely to expect me to play paper again or scissors (to follow the rotation).\n10. If they expect paper from me, scissors would be their optimal response.\n11. If I expect them to play scissors, rock would be my optimal response (+1 point).\n12. The risk is if they play paper instead, I would lose 3 points, but based on their pattern after significant losses, scissors seems more likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating that my opponent will switch to scissors to counter my previous winning paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've had multiple rock-rock ties throughout the game.\n5. Looking at what happened after our previous rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 10 (rock-rock tie), they played rock in Round 11\n   - After Round 15 (rock-rock tie), they played rock in Round 16\n   - After Round 16 (rock-rock tie), they played scissors in Round 17\n   - After Round 21 (rock-rock tie), they played paper in Round 22\n6. There's no consistent pattern after rock-rock ties.\n7. After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, expecting their opponent to do the same.\n8. They might expect me to switch to paper to try to beat their rock, and thus play scissors.\n9. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, anticipating that I'll overthink and play scissors.\n10. Given the overall game dynamics and their adaptability, they're more likely to switch after this tie.\n11. If they expect me to play paper (a common choice after rock ties), scissors would be their optimal response.\n12. If I expect them to play scissors, rock would be my optimal response (+1 point).\n13. The risk is if they play paper instead, I would lose 3 points.\n14. Based on psychological tendencies after ties and their pattern history, scissors seems their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with rock, anticipating that my opponent will switch to scissors expecting me to play paper after our rock tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"
