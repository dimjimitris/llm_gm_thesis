Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I could choose randomly.\n5. However, since paper has the potential for the highest reward (3 points), it might be strategically advantageous.\n6. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n7.

A common tendency is to \"upgrade\" to the next move that would beat their previous move.\n5. Since my opponent played paper in round 1, they might expect me to play scissors in round 2 (to beat their previous paper).\n6. To counter this, they might play rock in round 2 (to beat my expected scissors).\n7. If they follow this pattern and play rock, I should play paper to win.\n8. However, they might also maintain their paper strategy, expecting me to play rock.\n9. Or they might attempt to directly counter what I played last round by playing scissors.\n10. Weighing these possibilities, the most strategic move seems to be rock, which would:\n    - Beat scissors if they try to directly counter my previous paper move\n    - Lose to paper if they repeat their move, but paper gives the highest penalty (-3)\n    - Tie with rock if they follow the \"upgrade\" psychology\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This suggests they've realized I was exploiting their pattern and have now switched strategies.\n\n4. After a tie with both players playing rock, common strategies include:\n   - Staying with rock (expecting opponent to switch to paper, then countering with scissors)\n   - Switching to paper (to beat the previous rock)\n   - Switching to scissors (expecting opponent to switch to paper)\n\n5. Since they broke their pattern last round, they're clearly adapting their strategy.\n\n6. Their choice to play rock twice in a row (breaking their long-standing pattern) suggests they might be starting a new pattern or strategy.\n\n7. If they're employing basic psychology after a tie:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - They would then play scissors to counter my expected paper\n\n8. Alternatively, they might continue with rock for a third time, hoping to establish a new pattern or expecting me to overthink.\n\n9. Given they've shown willingness to adapt their strategy, and considering the psychological tendency to switch after a tie:\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper): rock wins\n   - If they play rock again (continuing new pattern): paper wins\n   - If they play paper (complete strategy shift): scissors wins\n\n10. The evidence suggests they're most likely to play scissors, expecting me to play paper after our rock tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've just won with rock against their scissors, which means they might expect me to play rock again since it was successful.\n\n4. Common psychology after losing:\n   - They might try to directly counter my last successful move (play paper to beat my expected rock)\n   - They might think I'll switch to paper (expecting them to play rock), so they might play scissors\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After I won in Round 4, they played paper in Round 5\n   - After I won in Round 8, they played rock in Round 9\n   - After I won in Round 9, they played rock again in Round 10\n   There's no consistent pattern in how they respond to losses.\n\n6.

Looking at the opponent's last three moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), they appear to be cycling through the standard sequence.\n\n5.

My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   They finally broke their rock pattern by playing scissors.\n\n3. I've now lost three rounds in a row, which suggests they're successfully anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Their switch from rock to scissors in the last round was perfectly timed to counter my paper play.\n\n5. After successfully breaking a long pattern, players often:\n   - Revert to the original pattern (would be rock in this case)\n   - Continue with the new move that just worked (scissors)\n   - Complete a cycle by playing the third option (paper)\n\n6. Given they just successfully used scissors after four rocks, they might:\n   - Play scissors again, expecting me to play paper again or thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat scissors\n   - Play rock, returning to their previously successful strategy\n   - Play paper, completing a full cycle of moves\n\n7. My recent moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   I've been cycling through all three options, which might be making me predictable.\n\n8. If they're analyzing my pattern, they might expect me to play rock next (continuing my cycle).\n\n9. Considering all factors:\n   - If they play scissors again: rock wins\n   - If they revert to rock: paper wins\n   - If they play paper: scissors wins\n\n10. The strongest indication is that they'll either continue with scissors (their most recent successful move) or revert to rock (their long-established pattern). Rock would be effective against scissors and would only tie against their potential rock play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, their success suggests they might be actively anticipating my moves rather than following a fixed pattern:\n   - They played rock when I played scissors\n   - They played scissors when I played paper\n   - They played paper when I played rock\n   This shows they've correctly countered my last three moves.\n\n6.

If they expect me to play scissors, they would play rock.\n   If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors.\n\n9. Their recent successful strategy suggests they're likely expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper.\n\n10.

I've just won after losing four rounds in a row, which might cause them to change their strategy.\n\n4.

After I won with paper against their rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Play paper again (repeating my successful move)\n   - Play scissors (moving to the next move in sequence)\n   - Play rock (completely changing strategy)\n\n6. Given my history of changing moves frequently, they might expect me not to repeat paper.\n\n7. Their most strategic responses would be:\n   - Play scissors (to beat my potential paper repeat)\n   - Play rock (to beat my potential scissors play)\n   - Play paper (only if they think I'll play rock)\n\n8. Since I just won with paper, there's psychological pressure for both of us to change our moves.\n\n9. Given these factors, they're most likely to play scissors to counter a potential paper repeat or rock to counter a potential scissors play.\n\n10. Rock would be effective against their likely scissors play, and would only lose against their less likely paper play.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has played rock in Rounds 17, 20, and 21.\n   They seem to have a recent preference for rock.\n\n3. After our rock-rock tie, common psychology suggests:\n   - Many players switch to paper after a rock tie (to win next round)\n   - Some players stay with rock, expecting their opponent to switch to paper\n   - Few players switch directly to scissors after a rock tie\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1, they played paper in Round 2\n   - After tie in Round 5, they played rock in Round 6\n   - After tie in Round 10, they played scissors in Round 11\n   - After ties in Rounds 15-16, they played rock in Round 17\n   - After tie in Round 21 (just now), they'll play ? in Round 22\n   No consistent pattern emerges in how they follow ties.\n\n5. However, after the consecutive rock-rock ties in Rounds 15-16, they played rock again in Round 17.\n   This suggests they might have a tendency to stick with rock after ties.\n\n6. Given their recent preference for rock and historical behavior:\n   - They might play rock again (continuing their apparent preference)\n   - They might play paper (the logical counter to our rock tie)\n   - They might play scissors (least likely based on psychology after a rock tie)\n\n7. If I play paper, I would:\n   - Beat their rock (most likely based on recent behavior)\n   - Tie with their paper\n   - Lose to their scissors (least likely option)\n\n8.

After losing twice with the same move (rock), players typically:\n   - Abandon that move (stop playing rock)\n   - Switch to the move that beat them (play paper)\n   - Or occasionally switch to the third option (play scissors)\n\n6. Given I've beaten them with paper twice recently, they're highly likely to:\n   - Stop playing rock (which keeps losing to my paper)\n   - Play scissors to counter my successful paper plays\n\n7. Their psychological pressure to change strategy after repeated losses with rock is very high.\n\n8. If they follow the most likely scenario and play scissors to counter my paper:\n   - Rock would be my optimal counter-move\n\n9. The alternative possibilities:\n   - They stubbornly stick with rock (unlikely after repeated losses)\n   - They try paper (somewhat likely as a complete strategy shift)\n\n10. Given the strong likelihood they'll switch to scissors after being beaten by paper twice:\n    - Rock provides the highest expected value\n    - Rock beats scissors and would only tie against another rock play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The most likely scenario is that they'll play either paper again or scissors.\n\n8. If they play paper again: scissors wins\n   If they play scissors: rock wins\n   If they return to rock: paper wins\n\n9. Considering they just successfully broke a long-standing pattern with paper, and this move gave them a high reward (3 points), they're most likely to continue with paper or switch to scissors.\n\n10.

This suggests they might be actively tracking my moves and have identified that I play scissors frequently enough that countering with rock is effective.\n\n7. After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (since it was just successful)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (least likely given their pattern)\n\n8.

Let's update the complete pattern of moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 25: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   They've now played a complete cycle in the last three rounds.\n\n3. I've now lost three rounds in a row, with different moves each time:\n   - Lost with rock against paper\n   - Lost with scissors against rock\n   - Lost with paper against scissors\n\n4. This suggests they might be successfully predicting my moves and countering them.\n\n5. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Rock: 11 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   Rock is their most frequent move, but they've been mixing strategies more recently.\n\n6. If they're following a standard cycle based on their last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they would play rock next.\n\n7. However, they might also be adapting to counter what they predict I'll play:\n   - I've just lost with paper against their scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock next (to beat their scissors)\n   - They would then play paper to counter my expected rock\n\n8. Given I've lost three times in a row, they might be confident in their ability to predict my next move.\n\n9. If they play rock (continuing cycle): paper wins\n   If they play paper (anticipating my rock): scissors wins\n   If they play scissors again (repeating): rock wins\n\n10. Since they've successfully countered my last three different moves, and given their historical preference for rock, they're most likely to either play rock (continuing their cycle) or paper (anticipating I'll play rock after losing to scissors).\n\n11. Scissors would be effective against their potential paper play, and would only lose against rock (which, while their most common move overall, would break their recent cycle).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They've completed a standard cycle in reverse order.\n\n3. I've just won with scissors against their paper, breaking my losing streak.\n\n4. After losing rounds, their pattern of next moves is:\n   - After losing Round 4, they played paper in Round 5\n   - After losing Round 8, they played rock in Round 9\n   - After losing Round 11, they played paper in Round 12\n   - After losing Round 20, they played rock in Round 21\n   - After losing Round 22, they played paper in Round 23\n   - After losing Round 26 (just now), they'll play ? in Round 27\n   No consistent pattern emerges in how they follow losses.\n\n5. However, looking at their last several moves (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), if they continue this reverse cycle, they would play rock next.\n\n6. After losing with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock (continuing their reverse cycle and countering scissors)\n   - Play scissors (completely changing strategy)\n   - Play paper again (least likely as it just lost)\n\n7. Given their historical preference for rock (11 times overall) and the fact that rock would both continue their reverse cycle and counter my winning scissors move, rock seems highly likely.\n\n8.

The strongest evidence points to them playing rock, making paper my optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This suggests they might have identified a pattern where I play paper frequently, and they're countering with scissors.\n\n5. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (since it was just successful)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (least likely given recent success with scissors)\n\n6. Given that scissors has been successful against me multiple times, they have a strong incentive to continue with it.\n\n7.

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They've broken their alternating pattern between scissors and paper.\n\n3. After our rock-rock tie, common psychology suggests:\n   - Many players switch to paper after a rock tie (to win next round)\n   - Some players stay with rock, expecting their opponent to switch to paper\n   - Few players switch directly to scissors after a rock tie\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1, they played paper in Round 2\n   - After tie in Round 5, they played rock in Round 6\n   - After tie in Round 10, they played scissors in Round 11\n   - After ties in Rounds 15-16, they played rock in Round 17\n   - After tie in Round 21, they played rock in Round 22\n   - After tie in Round 29 (just now), they'll play ? in Round 30\n   No consistent pattern emerges in how they follow ties.\n\n5. However, after our previous rock-rock ties:\n   - After tie in Round 10, they played scissors in Round 11\n   - After ties in Rounds 15-16, they played rock in Round 17\n   - After tie in Round 21, they played rock in Round 22\n\n6. Given this history and the common psychology after rock-rock ties:\n   - They might play paper (the logical counter to our rock tie)\n   - They might play rock again (as they've done after previous rock ties)\n   - They're least likely to play scissors (based on general psychology after rock ties)\n\n7. If they play paper: scissors wins\n   If they play rock again: paper wins\n   If they play scissors: rock wins\n\n8. The strongest evidence suggests they'll play either paper or rock following our tie.\n\n9. Scissors would beat their paper and lose to their potential rock play.\n   Paper would beat their rock and tie with their potential paper play.\n\n10. Since paper has a better expected outcome against their two most likely moves (win against rock, tie against paper), paper seems to be the optimal choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
