Since paper has the potential for the highest reward, it might be tempting to play rock to counter potential scissors.\n4. However, without prior information, any strategic advantage is purely theoretical.\n5. In the absence of information about my opponent, the optimal strategy is to randomize my choice to prevent being predictable.\n6. Since paper offers the highest reward potential (3 points), I'll choose paper for this first round.\n7.

If they continue this pattern after winning, they might stick with paper (since it worked) or switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper again).\n5. Given that paper gave them a big win last round, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.\n6. If they play paper again, my best counter would be scissors.\n7.

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 28: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n\n2. My opponent has now followed the exact rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern for twenty-eight consecutive rounds, despite losing twenty-five rounds in a row.\n\n3. Their pattern has remained perfectly consistent throughout the entire game, showing absolutely no adaptation or strategic adjustment.\n\n4. Based on their established pattern, their next move will be paper.\n\n5. The optimal counter to paper is scissors, which would give me 1 point.\n\n6. At this point, it is virtually certain they will continue with their pattern, as they've shown no deviation whatsoever despite consistent losses.\n\n7. My strategy of countering their predictable sequence has been extremely effective, allowing me to win all rounds except rounds 2 and 3.\n\n8. I should continue with this winning approach and play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
