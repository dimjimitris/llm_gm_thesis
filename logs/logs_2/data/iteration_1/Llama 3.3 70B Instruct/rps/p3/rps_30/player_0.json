    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is another instance of our opponent mirroring our moves or making similar strategic decisions. We've now had several consecutive ties, which suggests that our opponent is highly adaptive and able to mirror our moves consistently.\n\nPsychologist: It's possible that our opponent will continue to mirror our moves, trying to force a tie. However, they might also try to break the pattern and make a move that has a high chance of winning. Given the high frequency of ties, it's possible that our opponent is waiting for us to make a move that they can exploit.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff matrix, if we make the same move as before, we'll likely tie again. To break the tie streak, we need to make a move that our opponent is less likely to make, but also takes into account the possibility of them trying to break the pattern. One possible approach is to make a move that is less likely to be mirrored, but also has a high reward if our opponent makes a different move.\n\nCollaborating with our personas, I'll make a move that can take advantage of the possibility that our opponent will mirror our moves, but also consider the possibility of them trying to break the pattern.

This is another instance of our opponent mirroring our moves.\n\nPsychologist: It's possible that our opponent will continue to mirror our moves, trying to force a tie. However, they might also try to break the pattern and make a move that has a high chance of winning.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff matrix, if we make the move paper again, we risk tying again, which doesn't give us any advantage. However, if we make the move scissors, we have a chance to win 1 point if our opponent makes the move paper, but we risk losing 1 point if our opponent makes the move rock.\n\nCollaborating with our personas, I'll make a move that can take advantage of the possibility that our opponent will continue to mirror our moves, but also consider the possibility of them trying to break the pattern. Given the consecutive ties, I'll try to make a move that can break the tie streak and gain an advantage.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This suggests that our opponent is still making moves that can be exploited.\n\nPsychologist: It's possible that our opponent will try to adjust their strategy to avoid losing to scissors again. They might make a move that beats scissors, which is rock, to gain an advantage.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff matrix, if we make the move scissors again, we risk losing 1 point if our opponent makes the move rock. However, if we make the move rock, we have a chance to win 1 point if our opponent makes the move scissors, but we risk losing 3 points if our opponent makes the move paper.\n\nCollaborating with our personas, I'll make a move that can take advantage of the possibility that our opponent might still be vulnerable to the rock move, but also consider the possibility of them adjusting their strategy to make a move that beats scissors. Given the recent win, I'll try to make a move that can maintain the momentum and also consider the potential risks.\n\n[move] rock\n"
