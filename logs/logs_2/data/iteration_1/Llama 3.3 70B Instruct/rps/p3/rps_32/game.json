Since this is the first round and I don't have any information about the other player's strategy, I'll choose a move that has a relatively balanced payoff.\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, rock has a moderate chance of winning, losing, or tying, with a maximum penalty of -3 if the other player chooses paper.\n4. Paper has a higher potential reward (3 points) but also a higher potential penalty (-3 points) if the other player chooses scissors.\n5.
