Given the lack of information, a reasonable approach is to choose a move that could potentially beat one of the other player's possible moves while also considering the payoff.\n4. Rock beats scissors, giving 1 point. Paper beats rock, giving 3 points. Scissors beats paper, giving 1 point.\n5. Without any pattern or preference from the other player, a strategic move could be to choose the option that has a higher payoff when winning, as the worst-case scenario (losing) will have the same penalty regardless.\n6.

Considering the payoff matrix, choosing rock would put me in a position to win if my opponent chooses scissors, which they chose in the previous round.\n4. Given that the previous round was a tie, and we both chose scissors, my opponent might try to choose a move that is different from scissors, such as rock or paper.\n5. Since we've had several ties in a row, I'll try to choose a move that is likely to win, and also consider the possibility that my opponent will try to break the cycle of ties.\n\n[move] (Trying to choose a move that wins and breaks the cycle of ties) rock\n"
