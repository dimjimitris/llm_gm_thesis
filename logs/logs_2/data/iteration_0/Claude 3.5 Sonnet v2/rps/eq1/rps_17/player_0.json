    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the first round against a new player\n   * No prior history to analyze\n   * Player has no knowledge of my tendencies\n   * I have no knowledge of their tendencies\n\n2. Consider the classic RPS strategy:\n   * Rock, paper, and scissors should each have equal 1/3 probability for optimal play\n   * This prevents exploitation of patterns\n\n3. Psychology of first moves:\n   * Many players choose rock as first move\n   * Rock is perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\"\n   * This might make paper a good counter\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Paper beats anticipated rock (+1 point)\n   * Paper loses to scissors (-1 point)\n   * Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n   * The potential gain equals the potential loss\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Without prior information, exploiting common first-move psychology seems reasonable\n   * I'll choose paper to counter the common rock opening\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as my opening move, anticipating a possible rock first move from my opponent.\n"

Consider opponent's potential thinking:\n   * They succeeded with scissors\n   * They might stick with a winning move\n   * Alternatively, they might expect me to counter scissors\n\n3. Psychology after a loss:\n   * Players often change their move after winning\n   * They might think I'll expect them to use scissors again\n   * They might switch to rock thinking I'll use rock to counter their previous scissors\n\n4. Pattern consideration:\n   * If they switch to rock, scissors would be bad\n   * If they stick with scissors, rock would win\n   * If they switch to paper, scissors would win\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Rock provides good coverage against both scenarios:\n     - Beats scissors if they repeat\n     - Ties with rock if they switch to that\n     - Only loses to paper, which seems less likely given the aggressive opening\n\n[move] rock I choose rock to counter potential repeated scissors or a switch to rock.\n"
