    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and predicting behavior\n3. Statistical Analyst - For tracking patterns and probability analysis\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, there's no prior history to analyze. According to game theory, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal. However, research suggests that \"rock\" is often a common first move for many players due to its perceived strength.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Indeed, many players tend to choose \"rock\" as their first move as it feels more \"solid\" and \"strong.\" However, since this is a sophisticated game environment, the opponent might anticipate this tendency and choose \"paper\" to counter it.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without any previous data points, we can't make data-driven predictions. In such cases, it's best to avoid being too predictable. Since rock is common and paper might be chosen to counter rock, scissors could be an interesting opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the scissors suggestion. It's less common as an opening move, which might give us an advantage if the opponent goes with the standard \"rock\" or tries to be clever with \"paper.\"\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological advantage of scissors is that it's the least expected opening move, which could throw off an opponent who's thinking too deeply about typical opening strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Opening with scissors as it's less predictable and might catch an opponent off-guard who's expecting rock or trying to counter rock with paper.\n"

Now we need to consider that the opponent might adapt their strategy based on their loss.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing to scissors, many players would be hesitant to play paper again. There's often a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Play what just beat them (scissors) thinking we might repeat our previous move\n2. Play rock to counter the scissors they expect us to play again\n\nStatistical Analyst: The opponent has shown a preference for paper in their first move. While they might change their strategy, knowing they chose paper gives us a small insight into their decision-making process.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these insights, the opponent is most likely to play rock this round to counter our previous scissors play. They might assume we're feeling confident and will use scissors again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological pressure of losing the first round often leads to a more defensive second move, making rock highly probable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: If we believe rock is the most likely move from our opponent, then paper would be our optimal choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper also protects us reasonably well: if we're wrong and they play scissors, we only lose one point, but if they play rock as we expect, we win one point.

Question if we can somehow predict their moves\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze their moves:\nRound 1: They played paper (lost)\nRound 2: They played rock (lost)\nThis declining sequence (paper \u2192 rock) might suggest they could complete the cycle with scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown a tendency to change their move each time. They haven't repeated a move yet, and having tried paper and rock, scissors would complete the basic cycle.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Under pressure from two losses, players often resort to aggressive moves. Scissors is considered an aggressive move psychologically, as it's an attacking tool. This aligns with our prediction.\n\nGame Strategist: If we expect scissors, we should play rock. This would be particularly effective because:\n1. It counters the predicted scissors\n2. It breaks our own pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), making us less predictable\n3.

Return to their first successful move (though none were successful here)\n2. Try to be completely random to break predictability\n3. Mirror their opponent's last successful move\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological pressure on them is immense. They're likely to break their pattern entirely. After three losses, players often try to \"reset\" mentally. Many return to rock as it feels most secure and stable - a psychological \"fortress\" when feeling vulnerable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed. The likelihood of them completing another cycle is low, as they've likely noticed the pattern themselves.

Complete abandonment of strategy in favor of a purely emotional choice\n2. An attempt to make a \"clever\" move by thinking multiple levels ahead\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In such extreme losing situations, players often resort to scissors as a final aggressive \"all-in\" move. It represents:\n1. A sharp, aggressive tool\n2. A desperate attempt to cut through their losing streak\n3. A complete departure from their recent rock play\n4.
