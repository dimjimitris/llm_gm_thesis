Recent success:\n   - Round 26: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 27: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 28: paper vs rock (win)\n   - Paper choice worked perfectly\n\n2. Current momentum:\n   - Coming off a win\n   - Paper beat predictable rock\n   - Strategy of countering obvious working\n   - But opponent will adapt\n\n3. Psychology:\n   - They just lost to paper\n   - Most players counter with scissors\n   - But they know I might expect this\n   - They might try to outthink me\n\n4. Simple logic:\n   - After losing to paper\n   - Opponent likely wants change\n   - But might avoid obvious scissors\n   - Could try rock again to surprise\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Choose rock:\n      * Counters expected scissors\n      * Changes from winning paper\n      * Protects against double-bluff\n      * Simple but strategic\n   - When opponent is likely to counter, counter their counter\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern review:\n   - Paper has been strong recently\n   - I've been countered effectively\n   - Opponent not falling for obvious plays\n   - Need to reset approach\n\n3. Basic situation:\n   - Coming off a loss\n   - Opponent winning with paper\n   - They might expect me to play scissors\n   - Or expect me to overthink\n\n4. Simple strategy:\n   - Stop trying to predict\n   - Break from complex thinking\n   - Make direct choice\n   - Trust instinct\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Choose scissors:\n      * Direct counter to paper trend\n      * Clear, simple choice\n      * No mind games\n      * Sometimes obvious is best\n   - When overthinking fails, return to basics\n\n[move] scissors\n"
