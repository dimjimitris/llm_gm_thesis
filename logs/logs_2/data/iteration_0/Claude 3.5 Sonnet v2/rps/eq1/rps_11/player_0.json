    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - Specializes in analyzing patterns and predicting behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Evaluates risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their playing patterns. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent, it's often best to start with a randomized strategy to avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we indeed have no historical data to analyze. However, psychological studies show that rock is often the most common first move choice among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could consider playing paper to counter the statistically common rock first move. However, we should also consider that sophisticated players might be aware of this tendency and adjust accordingly.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. Even if our opponent doesn't play rock, paper is not a bad opening move as it appears less aggressive than rock or scissors, potentially making our strategy less obvious for future rounds.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Paper also gives us a good baseline to analyze the opponent's response for future rounds, as their reaction to paper can be quite telling of their strategic thinking.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk of playing paper is manageable. Worst case, we lose to scissors and learn something about our opponent's style.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the collaborative analysis, I will play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Our prediction about the first move being rock was correct, and we won with paper. Now, we need to consider how our opponent might adjust their strategy after losing. Players often change their move after a loss, and knowing they lost to paper, they might be inclined to choose scissors to counter what they think we might play again.\n\nGame Strategist: Good point. There are typically two common psychological responses after losing:\n1. Switching to what beat them (playing paper themselves)\n2. Switching to what would have beaten our previous move (playing scissors)\nThe second option is more common as it feels like a direct counter to their loss.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that analysis, playing rock would be our safest move. It would:\n- Beat scissors if they try to counter our previous paper\n- Tie against rock if they go back to their original move\n- Only lose to paper, which is psychologically less likely given the previous round\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The opponent has shown a conventional opening strategy (rock), which suggests they might follow conventional psychological patterns of trying to counter their loss.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock also gives us good positioning for future rounds as it doesn't reveal any complex strategy and maintains unpredictability in our play pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: The consensus is to play rock as it best counters the most likely opponent adaptation.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has shown a clear pattern:\nRound 1: They played rock (lost)\nRound 2: They played paper (won)\nThis suggests they might be using a clockwise rotation pattern in the classic rock-paper-scissors sequence (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors). If they're following this pattern, they're likely to play scissors next.\n\nGame Strategist: However, we should be cautious about assuming such a simple pattern. The opponent has demonstrated adaptive thinking by successfully countering our second move. They might be more sophisticated than we initially thought. They could be:\n1. Following the clockwise pattern (suggesting scissors next)\n2. Sticking with paper since it just won\n3. Using a more complex strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Given these possibilities, let's assess our options:\n- If we play rock: Beats scissors (if they're rotating), loses to paper (if they're staying)\n- If we play paper: Beats rock (unlikely given history), loses to scissors\n- If we play scissors: Beats paper (good against paper-staying strategy), loses to rock\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can adapt. They've played rationally so far, and their moves make strategic sense. Playing rock would be too defensive, and paper seems unlikely to work. Scissors gives us the best chance against both their potential paper-staying strategy and their possible attempt to appear predictable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent's moves suggest they understand basic strategy. Scissors is our best move as it covers the most likely scenarios we've identified.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Let's play scissors, as it counters both the pattern-following strategy (if they play scissors) and the winning-move-staying strategy (if they play paper again).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, after a tie, patterns often break as both players try to gain advantage.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie creates an interesting psychological moment. After a tie with scissors, players often:\n1. Stay with scissors hoping to catch the other player switching\n2. Switch to rock thinking the opponent will stay with scissors\n3. Switch to paper trying to be one step ahead of rock\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the risk-reward for each option:\n- Rock: Safe choice, beats scissors if they repeat, loses to paper if they're thinking ahead\n- Paper: Aggressive choice, beats rock but vulnerable to scissors repeat\n- Scissors: Could maintain the tie, but seems too predictable after a tie\n\nGame Strategist: Given that our opponent has shown strategic thinking and pattern awareness, they're likely to expect us to play rock (the most common move after a scissors tie). Therefore, they might play paper to counter that expected rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated good strategic adaptation in previous rounds. They're likely to think one level deeper than the obvious rock play.\n\nRisk Manager: While scissors might seem risky after just playing it, it could be unexpected enough to work. However, I believe their most likely move is paper, expecting our rock. Therefore, I suggest we play scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Playing scissors here has the element of surprise, as it's psychologically difficult to play the same move after a tie, but that's exactly why it might work.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Let's play scissors again. It goes against common psychology (which our opponent seems to understand and exploit), and could catch them if they play paper expecting our rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This could mean they're:\n1. Starting a new cycle\n2. Adapting to counter our moves\n3. Using a more complex strategy\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated play. They've:\n- Adapted well after losses\n- Completed a full cycle\n- Successfully broke the tie situation\n- Are currently on a winning momentum\n\nRisk Manager: Our current score is -1 (1-1-0-1), so we need to be more effective. Looking at their pattern, if they're starting a new cycle, they might play paper next. If they're playing reactively to their success, they might stick with rock after their win.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've shown both pattern play and adaptive thinking, we should consider that they might expect us to play paper to counter their potential rock repeat. They might switch to scissors anticipating this.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, their return to rock in the last round might indicate a preference for stable, powerful moves after uncertain situations (like the tie we had). This could suggest they'll stay with rock or move to another strong position.\n\nRisk Manager: Given these analyses, paper is too risky as it could walk into scissors. Rock would be our safest play here - it would:\n- Tie against a rock repeat\n- Beat scissors if they try to anticipate our paper\n- Only lose to paper if they're strictly following their cycle\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock gives us the best risk-adjusted outcome and helps stabilize our position after two non-winning rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Let's play rock.

We're at -2 points total, and our opponent has shown both pattern adherence and winning effectiveness. If they're truly committed to their cycling pattern, they should play scissors next.

We've won the last four rounds, putting us at +2 points total, and they still haven't deviated. Following the pattern, they should play rock next.\n\nRisk Manager: At this point, there are two major considerations:\n1. The pattern has been maintained for 9 straight rounds despite:\n   - Multiple losses\n   - A clear negative score for them (-2 points)\n   - Our obvious recognition of their pattern\n2. This might be the breaking point - four consecutive losses could finally trigger a change\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure on them is now extreme. They've lost 4 times in a row and are down by 4 points in recent rounds. However, their commitment to the pattern has transcended normal strategic play - it almost seems like a predetermined decision to maintain this pattern regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Strategist: If they maintain pattern (rock), paper wins\nIf they finally break pattern with paper, paper ties\nIf they break pattern with scissors, paper loses\n\nRisk Manager: Given their extraordinary pattern commitment, playing paper is our best option:\n- Beats rock (continuing pattern)\n- Ties with paper (if they finally break pattern conservatively)\n- Loses to scissors (if they break pattern aggressively)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The probability analysis is interesting here. While normally the chance of maintaining such a predictable pattern for 10 rounds would be extremely low, this player has shown it's not a random probability - it appears to be a conscious choice to maintain the pattern regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. While this seems like the most obvious moment for them to break pattern (after 4 straight losses), they've had multiple \"obvious moments\" before and stayed consistent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Let's play paper. Despite this being perhaps the most pressure-filled moment for them to finally break their pattern, their previous commitment has been so extraordinary that we should trust in their continuation. Playing paper gives us the best chance to extend our winning streak to five rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n"
