    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Opponent's pattern:\n   - Recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They're alternating between aggressive (scissors) and defensive (paper) plays\n   - They've become somewhat predictable\n   - Last move was paper, suggesting scissors might come next\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - I have strong momentum\n   - Opponent has lost several rounds\n   - They're likely frustrated\n   - They need to break their predictable pattern\n   - They might realize I've figured out their alternating strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Could play rock to beat expected scissors\n   - Could play paper to beat potential defensive rock\n   - Could play scissors again but that's likely too obvious\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Opponent is likely to make a major strategy change\n   - They might abandon their alternating pattern\n   - They might try to double-play paper to trick me\n   - Need to protect against desperate moves\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock. This protects against both their pattern (which would suggest scissors next) and against a desperate aggressive move. Even if they try paper, the risk is worth taking given our recent success.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last few rounds:\n     * Rock beat scissors (+1)\n     * Scissors lost to rock (-1)\n     * Paper lost to scissors (-1)\n   - Score back to +1\n   - Stopped losing streak\n   - Regained some momentum\n\n2. Pattern observation:\n   - Opponent's last three moves:\n     * Scissors (just lost)\n     * Rock (won)\n     * Scissors (won)\n   - They've shown preference for aggressive plays\n   - Their scissors plays have had mixed results\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - We've regained initiative\n   - Opponent lost with scissors\n   - They might be expecting us to stay with rock\n   - They likely want to counter our successful move\n\n4. Common post-rock-win scenarios:\n   - Winner often stays with rock (conservative)\n   - Loser often switches to paper (counter)\n   - Some expect this and play scissors\n   - Mind games become more complex\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If we play rock again: safe but predictable\n   - If we play paper: risky but high reward\n   - If we play scissors: vulnerable to rock again\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - We have small positive score to protect\n   - Opponent likely to counter our rock\n   - They've shown willingness to make aggressive plays\n   - Need balanced approach\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper. While this might seem obvious after winning with rock, it's the right move because:\n- Protects against their likely rock play (either staying rock or countering our expected rock)\n- Offers highest reward potential (+3)\n- Even if they play scissors, the -1 loss is acceptable given our current position\n- Shows we're willing to make aggressive plays rather than just defensive ones\n\n[move] paper\n"

Common reactions after losing to paper:\n   - Scissors to counter expected paper repeat\n   - Rock to stabilize and force tie\n   - Paper to mirror and reset situation\n\n5.

This protects against their likely scissors counter to our successful paper play. With a good score cushion, we can afford to play defensively. Even if they play paper, losing 3 points still keeps us positive.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - We have healthy +5 lead\n   - Can afford to be conservative\n   - Don't need to chase big gains\n   - Should protect our advantage\n\n5. Opponent's likely moves:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n     * Play paper to beat expected rock\n     * Play rock to force tie and regroup\n     * Stay with scissors out of frustration\n   - Given their losses, paper is most logical choice\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Could keep rock, but too predictable\n   - Could play paper, but risky\n   - Scissors counters their likely paper play\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors. While we could play it safe with rock again, the opponent is likely to finally switch to paper to counter our successful rock plays. They need to break their losing streak, and paper would be their most logical move. Even if we're wrong and they play rock, the -1 penalty is acceptable given our strong position.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
