    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer: Studies opponent behavior and identifies patterns\n3. Risk Manager: Evaluates risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when beating rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when winning. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. We're starting with a blank slate.\n\nRisk Manager: In this situation, I suggest going with paper. Here's why:\n1. Highest potential reward (3 points)\n2. Even if we lose to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. Against a fresh player, there's no reason to believe they favor any particular move\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The expected value for paper is higher than rock or scissors when assuming random opponent moves. (3-1-0)/3 = 0.67 average points for paper vs (1-3-0)/3 = -0.67 for rock and (1-1-0)/3 = 0 for scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since we can't predict the opponent's move yet, maximizing expected value is a sound strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on expected value analysis and risk-reward ratio\n"

They might be likely to switch moves after a tie\n3. They could be trying to establish a pattern\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with paper, common human psychology suggests the opponent might:\n1. Switch to scissors thinking we'll play paper again\n2. Stay with paper expecting us to switch\n3. Switch to rock thinking we'll switch to scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Given these possibilities, I suggest playing rock for this round:\n1. If opponent switches to scissors (trying to beat our previous paper), we win 1 point\n2. If opponent stays with paper, we lose 3 points\n3. If opponent switches to rock, we tie (0 points)\nThe downside risk is significant (-3), but the opponent's likely move of scissors (based on psychology) would give us a win.\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. Since paper-paper indicates our opponent might also be playing strategically, they might anticipate our rock play. I suggest scissors:\n1. Beats paper if they stick to their previous move\n2. Ties with scissors if they make the most obvious switch\n3. Loses to rock, but rock is less likely given the previous paper play\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with Game Strategist. Scissors is the more logical choice given the opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking with their first paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on opponent's previous strategic play and psychological factors\n"

If that's true, they might play scissors next.\n\nRisk Manager: However, we need to consider that they've won the last round and might stick with a winning strategy. Let's assess our options:\n1. Paper: Beats rock (if they stick to it), loses to scissors (if they follow the pattern)\n2. Rock: Ties with rock, beats scissors\n3. Scissors: Loses to rock, beats paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given our negative score, we should prioritize a safer play. Rock would be safest because:\n1. It beats scissors (which they might play if following the pattern)\n2. It ties with rock (if they stick to their winning move)\n3. Only loses to paper, which seems less likely given their recent rock play\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent has shown strategic thinking, and rock gives us the best protection against both their possible strategies (pattern continuation or stick-to-winner).\n\nRisk Manager: Rock also has the best risk-reward profile here.

Continue the pattern, which would mean paper is next\n2. Break the pattern because we just discovered it and won\n3. Stick with scissors since humans sometimes repeat losing moves thinking opponents won't expect it\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume they're a strategic player (which they've shown signs of being), they know we've spotted their pattern. A strategic player would likely break the pattern here. Let's evaluate options:\n1. Paper: Risky if they play scissors, but best payoff if they return to rock\n2. Rock: Safe against scissors, but vulnerable to paper\n3. Scissors: Good if they stick to pattern (paper), or repeat their last move\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors here. Here's why:\n1.

The psychology of success suggests a high probability they'll stick with rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with paper.
