    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock has highest payoff (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors has lower payoff (1 point)\n   - Scissors beating paper has lower payoff (1 point)\n\n3. Since paper has potential for highest reward:\n   - If opponent plays rock, I get 3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n4. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers best risk-reward ratio\n   - Maximum gain of 3 points\n   - Maximum loss of only 1 point\n   - Neutral outcome possible\n\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: paper vs scissors (loss)\n   - Round 2: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 4: scissors vs paper (win)\n   - Round 5: paper vs scissors (loss)\n   - Round 6: rock vs scissors (win)\n   - Round 7: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: rock vs scissors (win)\n   - Round 9: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: rock vs scissors (win)\n   - Round 11: rock vs scissors (win)\n\n2. Pattern analysis is now definitive:\n   - Opponent has used scissors in 9 out of 11 rounds (82%)\n   - They've lost FOUR times to rock\n   - No deviation from scissors after multiple losses\n   - This is almost certainly a bot with fixed behavior\n\n3. Statistical certainty:\n   - Opponent's moves:\n     * Scissors: 9 times (82%)\n     * Rock: 1 time (9%)\n     * Paper: 1 time (9%)\n   - Scissors preference is beyond any reasonable doubt\n\n4. Strategic conclusion:\n   - This is not a human opponent making strategic decisions\n   - It appears to be a programmed behavior\n   - The pattern is too consistent to be random or strategic\n   - There's no evidence of learning or adaptation\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - The risk of them suddenly changing strategy after 11 rounds seems minimal\n   - Rock has been consistently successful\n   - No rational reason to change winning strategy against fixed behavior\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again. The opponent's behavior is so consistent that any other choice would be ignoring clear evidence.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern assessment:\n   - Original scissors-heavy strategy\n   - Then showed paper capability\n   - Then rock\n   - Now back to scissors\n   - They seem to mix predictability with surprise\n\n3. After scissors-scissors tie history:\n   - Previously, they've often:\n     a) Stuck with scissors\n     b) Occasionally switched to counter expected response\n   - But now they're showing more adaptability\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Rock: Good against scissors (+1), vulnerable to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Good against rock (+3), vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors: Safe against paper (+1), vulnerable to rock (-1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They've matched our last two moves (rock, scissors)\n   - This could indicate they're:\n     a) Mirroring our moves\n     b) Setting up for a counter\n     c) Trying to establish a pattern to break\n   - After scissors tie, they might expect rock from us\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper. If they're anticipating rock from us after scissors tie (which is common), paper will counter their rock. If they stick with scissors, we only lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio favors this move given their recent adaptive behavior.\n\n[move] paper\n"
