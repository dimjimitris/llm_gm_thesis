Analyzing recent history:\n   - Round 10: paper vs paper (tie 0)\n   - Round 11: scissors vs scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 12: scissors vs rock (I lost -1)\n   - Opponent successfully broke the mirroring pattern\n   - They correctly predicted and countered my scissors\n\n2. Psychology of the situation:\n   - Opponent just won their first round after many losses\n   - Their strategy of breaking the mirror pattern worked\n   - They might feel validated in their decision making\n   - Success often encourages similar strategic choices\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has evolved from:\n      - Losing repeatedly\n      - To mirroring for ties\n      - To successfully countering\n   - They've shown increasing strategic sophistication\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After winning with rock, opponent might:\n      a) Stick with rock since it just worked\n      b) Expect me to play rock to beat their expected paper\n      c) Play paper to beat expected rock\n   - Winners often stick with their successful move\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their recent success with rock\n   - And the psychological boost from winning\n   - They're likely to either:\n      - Stay with rock (common after success)\n      - Or play paper (expecting my rock counter)\n   - Paper would beat rock and tie with paper\n   - Paper has best reward potential (+3) with moderate risk\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - My last three moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Opponent's moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - At this point, pattern analysis might be irrelevant because:\n      a) Opponent might abandon all patterns\n      b) Might make purely emotional choices\n      c) Might try random moves out of desperation\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After losing to scissors, typical responses are:\n      a) Play rock to beat scissors\n      b) Avoid paper after just losing with it\n      c) Unlikely to play scissors (would be admitting defeat)\n   - But typical responses may not apply in this extreme situation\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their likely complete frustration\n   - And the probability they'll try anything to win\n   - Rock is most likely their play because:\n      a) It beats the scissors that just beat them\n      b) It's often seen as the \"strongest\" move\n      c) Players often revert to rock in desperate situations\n   - Paper would be optimal:\n      - Beats their likely rock play\n      - Higher reward (+3) justifies risk\n      - Even if they play scissors, only loses 1 point\n      - They're unlikely to play paper again after just losing with it\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
