    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while having minimal downside (-1 points) when losing to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we don't have any patterns to analyze yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\" psychologically.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with the Game Strategist's analysis. Paper offers an asymmetric payoff - high reward potential (3 points) with limited downside risk (-1 points). Even if we're wrong, we minimize our potential loss.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this collective analysis, paper appears to be the optimal first move. It capitalizes on the common \"first-move rock\" tendency, has the highest potential payoff, and limited downside risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio with potential for high points (3) if opponent chooses rock, while limiting potential losses (-1) if opponent chooses scissors.\n"

They might switch to scissors next, expecting us to play paper again\n3. They might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they matched our strategic choice of paper, we're likely dealing with a thoughtful player. In game theory, after a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting and countering their opponent's next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the possibilities:\n- If we play rock: Win 3 if they play paper, Lose 3 if they play scissors\n- If we play paper: Tie 0 if they play paper, Lose 1 if they play scissors, Win 3 if they play rock\n- If we play scissors: Win 1 if they play paper, Lose 1 if they play rock, Tie 0 if they play scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they showed strategic thinking with paper in round 1, there's a higher probability they'll try to counter our previous move by playing scissors. We should anticipate this.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Playing scissors would be risky as they might expect that from us. Playing paper again seems too predictable. Rock would be too risky with its high penalty against paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The safest counter to their likely scissors play would be rock. Even if they stick to paper, the -3 points loss is acceptable given the probability distribution of their likely moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking and the likelihood they'll try to counter our previous paper play, rock provides the best counter to their probable scissors move.\n"

After losing to our rock, they might expect us to stick with the winning move (rock), so they might play paper to counter that.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's evaluate options:\n1.

If we play scissors: Good counter if they play paper (+1), acceptable loss if they play rock (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've shown a tendency to try countering our previous move, and they just lost to rock, paper would be their most logical choice to beat our expected rock play.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. They've demonstrated strategic thinking in both rounds, first matching our paper, then trying to counter it.

Rock: Safe against scissors, but high risk against paper (-3)\n3.
