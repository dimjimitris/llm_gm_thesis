I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we have no prior history to analyze for patterns.\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies.\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n4. Studies show that rock is slightly more common as a first move among human players, so paper might have a slight advantage.\n5. However, without knowing if my opponent is aware of such tendencies, this is speculative.\n6. Given the complete uncertainty, I should make my choice unpredictable.\n7. I'll choose paper for this first round, as it beats the statistically common first choice of rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests that players often shift after a tie, rather than repeating the same move.\n4.

Since we've matched moves twice, it suggests our thinking is aligned. Breaking this pattern would be strategic.\n9.

We've now tied with scissors twice, which suggests:\n   - We're both using similar reasoning at certain points\n   - They might be deliberately matching my scissors plays\n\n4. After a tie with scissors, common strategies include:\n   - Playing rock, which would beat a repeated scissors\n   - Playing scissors again, expecting the opponent to play paper\n   - Playing paper, expecting the opponent to play rock to counter scissors\n\n5. Given the history of our game and their tendency to play scissors frequently, they might:\n   - Play rock, anticipating I'll play scissors again or paper\n   - Play scissors again, thinking I wouldn't expect a third scissors tie\n   - Play paper if they think I'll definitely switch to rock\n\n6. My opponent has shown they can adapt well to counter my moves, but they also have a tendency to return to scissors.\n\n7. Since we've tied with scissors twice, and they've played scissors 5 times total, I think there's a higher probability they'll switch to rock this time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has beat my paper with scissors 3 times now\n   - Scissors is clearly their dominant strategy\n   - They've won 4 rounds with scissors, lost 1 with scissors, and tied 2 with scissors\n\n4. My record against them:\n   - I've won 3 rounds, lost 6 rounds, and tied 3 rounds\n   - I'm currently on a losing streak\n\n5.

The most straightforward counter to their scissors-heavy strategy is rock.\n\n7. However, they might be anticipating exactly this adaptation and switch to paper.\n\n8. Since they've beaten my paper with scissors three times, and we've tied with scissors twice, they likely expect me to finally stop playing paper and potentially play rock.\n\n9. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate my moves, but also their strong preference for scissors, I need to make a decision that accounts for both possibilities.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their frequent scissors play, as this is the most direct counter to their dominant strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete history of our moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've returned to rock after their scissors play lost\n   - This suggests they accurately predicted my scissors move\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - My win was followed by a loss\n   - My overall record is 6 wins, 8 losses, and 5 ties\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - They seem to be shifting toward a rock-dominant strategy\n   - They've successfully adapted to counter my recent moves\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with rock against my scissors, they might stick with rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - If they expect paper from me, they would play scissors\n\n6. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (continuing their recent preference), I should play paper\n   - If they play scissors (countering my expected paper), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to play rock), I should play scissors\n\n7. Given their recent success with rock and the overall game dynamics:\n   - They might continue with rock since it just worked\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper to counter their rock and thus play scissors\n   - Their recent pattern suggests increased rock usage\n\n8. After their successful rock play against my scissors, I need to consider both their potential to repeat a winning move and their ability to anticipate my counter.\n\n9. Based on their recent pattern shift toward more rock plays and the psychological tendency to repeat winning moves, I believe they're more likely to play rock again or switch to scissors in anticipation of my paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their potential rock repeat, while accepting the risk that they might have anticipated this and played scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've beaten my paper with scissors 4 times now\n   - They've returned to an alternating pattern between rock and scissors\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - I've lost 2 rounds in a row\n   - My overall record is 6 wins, 9 losses, and 5 ties\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played scissors 10 times (50% of all rounds)\n   - They've won with scissors against my paper 4 times\n   - They seem to have returned to favoring scissors\n\n5. Scissors analysis:\n   - When I've played against their scissors: I've lost 4 times with paper, tied 3 times with scissors, won 0 times with rock\n   - This means they've played scissors when I played rock 0 times out of 10 scissors plays\n   - This is a significant pattern - they avoid playing scissors when I play rock\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with scissors against my paper, they might continue with scissors\n   - However, their pattern suggests they never play scissors when I play rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors and thus play paper\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (continuing their winning move), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock (returning to alternation), I should play paper\n\n8. Given their strong scissors preference but complete avoidance of playing scissors against my rock:\n   - Playing rock gives me the best chance of either winning against scissors or tying against rock\n   - The data strongly suggests they won't play scissors if they expect me to play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as it has the highest expected value against their likely moves, based on their demonstrated pattern of never playing scissors against my rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My performance update:\n   - I've broken my losing streak with a win\n   - My overall record is 7 wins, 10 losses, and 5 ties\n\n4.

Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their 4-round pattern is strong evidence for scissors\n   - The psychological tendency to break patterns after losses provides some counter-evidence\n   - The clear pattern outweighs the speculative psychological factors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors move, based on the strong cyclical pattern they've established over the last 4 rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - They've shown a tendency to play scissors after rock-rock ties previously\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n\n6. Historical pattern after rock-rock ties:\n   - We've had rock-rock ties twice before (rounds 16-17)\n   - After those ties, they played scissors in round 18\n   - This historical pattern might repeat\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors (following historical pattern after rock-rock ties), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock again (highly unusual after consecutive rock plays), I should play paper\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Their historical behavior after rock-rock ties suggests scissors is likely\n   - The psychological tendency to change after ties also suggests they'll move away from rock\n   - Their overall game history shows a preference for scissors (played in 10 rounds)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again to counter their likely scissors play, based on their historical behavior after rock-rock ties and their overall preference for scissors throughout the game.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played rock four times in a row\n   - This is extraordinary and defies conventional game theory\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - Current record: 7 wins, 10 losses, 8 ties\n   - We've now tied with rock 6 times\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Four consecutive rock plays is extremely unusual\n   - This suggests either a deliberate strategy or a psychological experiment\n   - It breaks all normal patterns of play\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After four consecutive identical moves, the pressure to change is overwhelming\n   - They might be testing my patience or trying to condition my response\n   - They might expect me to finally switch to paper after so many rock ties\n\n6. Game theory considerations:\n   - The optimal counter to their apparent strategy is to play paper\n   - However, they might be deliberately setting a trap, expecting me to finally play paper\n   - If they're setting a trap, they would switch to scissors at exactly the point they expect me to switch to paper\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors (finally breaking their rock streak), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock a fifth time (defying all conventional wisdom), I should play paper\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - Four consecutive rock plays is so unusual that it must be deliberate\n   - They might be attempting to create a pattern just to break it at a critical moment\n   - The psychological tension to switch is now extreme for both players\n\n9. Final analysis:\n   - Their most likely move is scissors, anticipating I'll finally switch to paper\n   - A fifth consecutive rock would be almost unheard of in rock-paper-scissors strategy\n   - This is clearly a psychological game at this point\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to paper, accepting the risk that they might have been setting up this exact moment to play scissors. After four consecutive rock plays, the expected value of playing paper is higher than continuing with rock, even considering the possibility of a trap.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They broke their rock streak with scissors exactly when I switched to paper\n   - This confirms they were setting up a deliberate trap\n\n3. My performance update:\n   - Current record: 7 wins, 11 losses, 8 ties\n   - They've beaten my paper with scissors 5 times now\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - They successfully predicted my switch to paper after a long rock streak\n   - They've shown remarkable patience in executing this strategy\n   - Their pattern of play is highly strategic rather than random\n\n5. Psychological factors:\n   - After successfully springing their trap, they might return to a more conventional strategy\n   - They might expect me to play rock next to counter their scissors\n   - If they expect rock from me, they might play paper\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - They've demonstrated advanced psychological gameplay\n   - They're clearly tracking patterns and making deliberate moves\n   - They might continue with psychological manipulation\n\n7. My strategy considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (expecting me to play paper), I should play rock\n   - If they play paper (countering my expected rock), I should play scissors\n   - If they play rock (returning to their previous streak), I should play paper\n\n8. Weighing the evidence:\n   - After successfully executing their trap, they're unlikely to play scissors again immediately\n   - They've shown they can anticipate my moves and plan several steps ahead\n   - Their most logical move would be paper, anticipating my rock response to their scissors\n\n9. Final analysis:\n   - They're likely expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - Given their demonstrated strategic thinking, paper is their most probable next move\n   - However, they might also try to double-bluff by playing scissors again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move. This acknowledges their likely anticipation of my rock response to their scissors and attempts to stay one step ahead in this psychological battle.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I just lost because my opponent played rock when I expected paper. This is the first time they've broken their pattern significantly.\n\n4. They played rock twice in a row (rounds 13 and 14), which is new behavior.\n\n5. This suggests they've become aware that I was predicting their pattern and have deliberately changed their strategy.\n\n6. After consecutive rock plays, they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll expect them to switch\n   - Switch to paper or scissors now that they've broken their pattern\n\n7. Since they just deviated from their pattern with rock, and players rarely play the same move three times in a row, they're likely to switch.\n\n8. Given that they've now shown they're adapting to counter my strategy, I need to be more cautious about assuming they'll follow any pattern.\n\n9. The most common follow-up to rock in their previous pattern was paper, but they've just demonstrated they're breaking that pattern.\n\n10. After winning with rock, a common psychological move is to stick with the winning move or to switch to paper (expecting the opponent to play rock).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter their potential rock move, which seems more likely than scissors based on their history and game psychology.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've lost the last two rounds, which suggests my opponent has changed their strategy.\n\n4. Their recent moves (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) show they've abandoned their previous pattern.\n\n5. After playing scissors, their historical pattern would suggest paper might come next. However, they've clearly broken from their pattern.\n\n6. They might be deliberately trying to counter what they think I'll play.\n\n7. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n8. Given that they've been adapting and have won the last two rounds, I need to avoid being predictable.\n\n9. The safest move against an opponent who's adapting and just played scissors is rock, which beats scissors and would only tie against another rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, which would beat their scissors if they repeat it and tie against rock if they switch to that.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given that we've just had a tie with rock, the most common psychological move is to switch to paper.\n\n8. But my opponent has shown they're adapting and trying to counter my moves, so they might anticipate this common response.\n\n9.

Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 22: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 23: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 24: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 25: Both chose rock (tie)\n\n2. This is extraordinary - we've now had three consecutive ties with both of us playing rock.\n\n3. Playing the same move four times in a row is extremely rare in rock-paper-scissors, especially after three ties.\n\n4. The psychological pressure to switch after three identical ties is immense.\n\n5. My opponent has shown unusual persistence by sticking with rock three times, which might indicate:\n   - They're trying to establish a pattern to break later\n   - They're testing if I'll eventually switch\n   - They're using an unconventional strategy\n\n6. After three consecutive rock ties, I believe it's almost certain that at least one of us will switch.\n\n7. If my opponent finally switches, the most logical choice would be paper (which beats rock).\n\n8. If they expect me to switch to paper after three rock ties, they might play scissors.\n\n9. Given the extreme rarity of four identical moves in a row and the psychological tendency to switch after multiple ties, paper seems like their most likely move.\n\n10. If they play paper and I play rock again, I would lose. If they play scissors and I play paper, I would lose.\n\n11. Considering the unusual persistence they've shown with rock, and the overwhelming tendency to eventually switch, I believe paper is their most likely move after three rock ties.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to counter their likely paper move, as they would finally be expected to switch after three consecutive rock ties.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I correctly predicted that my opponent would finally switch to paper after three consecutive rock ties, and I won with scissors.\n\n3.

Their recent behavior showed unusual persistence with rock for three rounds, followed by a predictable switch to paper.\n\n7. After losing, players often revert to more basic, reactive strategies - the most straightforward counter to my scissors would be rock.\n\n8. Given their behavior pattern throughout the game and the psychology after a loss, rock seems like their most likely move to counter my winning scissors.\n\n9. If they play rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n10. While there's a chance they might think multiple levels ahead and play scissors, the most probable move based on basic strategy and psychology after a loss is rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter their likely rock move, as they try to beat my previous winning scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent switched to scissors and defeated my paper move.\n\n3. This suggests they're thinking one level ahead of me - they anticipated I would play paper to counter their expected rock.\n\n4. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors, thinking I might play paper again\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n5. Given that they just won with scissors, there's some incentive for them to stick with the winning move.\n\n6. However, they've shown throughout the game that they're adaptive and think ahead.\n\n7.

The last round ended in a tie with both of us playing paper.\n\n3. After a tie, players often switch their move, thinking their opponent will either:\n   - Stick with the same move, hoping for a win this time\n   - Switch to what would beat the previous move\n\n4. The natural progression after paper is often scissors (to beat paper).\n\n5. My opponent might anticipate that I'll play scissors after our paper tie and play rock to counter.\n\n6. However, they might also think I'll anticipate their rock and play paper again, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n7. Given their demonstrated ability to think strategically throughout the game, they're likely to switch rather than play paper again.\n\n8.
