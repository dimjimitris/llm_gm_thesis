This suggests my opponent was thinking along the same lines as me - expecting the other player to stick with paper or respond to the previous outcome in a similar way.\n\nFor this round, I'm choosing rock. Since we just both played scissors, there's a strong possibility my opponent might stick with scissors again (expecting another tie) or switch to rock anticipating I might switch to paper. By playing rock, I can either tie if they also play rock or win if they stick with scissors. If they play paper, they'll win, but based on our history and the frequent ties, I believe rock gives me the best chance for a positive outcome in this situation.\n"

By playing scissors myself, I'm preparing for a potential scissors-scissors tie. If they play paper expecting me to play rock again, I'll win.
