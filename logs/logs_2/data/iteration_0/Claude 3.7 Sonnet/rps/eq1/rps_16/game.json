In the absence of information, each option (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal 1/3 probability of winning.\n3. Rock is often a common first move for many players due to psychological factors - it feels \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n4. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate rock and play paper as their first move.\n5. I could try to be one step ahead and play scissors, which would beat paper.\n6. But this is all speculation without data on my specific opponent.\n7. Since I have no prior information, any choice is equally rational from a game theory perspective.\n8.

I've now won 6 rounds, tied 5, and lost 0. My strategy continues to work well.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after rock-rock ties:\n   - After round 2's tie, they played paper in round 3\n   - After round 5's tie, they played paper in round 6\n   - After round 8's tie, they played paper in round 9\n   \n5. This is their most consistent pattern: they play paper after rock-rock ties.\n\n6. Based on this strong pattern, they are likely to play paper again after our rock-rock tie in round 11.\n\n7. However, they might finally recognize this pattern since they've lost with paper every time after these ties.\n\n8. If they're aware of their own pattern, they might try to break it by playing rock again or switching to scissors.\n\n9. But given their highly consistent behavior throughout the game, I think paper is still their most likely move.\n\n10. To counter their expected paper move, scissors would be my best choice.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern has evolved: after their long pattern of predictable moves, they played scissors in both rounds 15 and 16.\n\n3. This suggests they may have settled on a new strategy of playing scissors, perhaps thinking I would continue playing paper.\n\n4. After losing with scissors in round 16, they need to adapt again.\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after losses throughout the game:\n   - After losing with paper, they typically played rock\n   - After losing with rock, they typically played rock again\n   - Now they've lost with scissors, and we don't have past data on how they react to this\n\n6. They might:\n   - Return to their old pattern (play rock after a loss)\n   - Try paper since they've now tried scissors without sustained success\n   - Stick with scissors despite the loss, thinking I might switch back to paper\n\n7. Given their history of being slow to adapt (taking 14 rounds before changing strategy), they might revert to their old pattern of playing rock after a loss.\n\n8. However, they might also recognize that their scissors strategy worked once (round 15) and try to counter my expected rock with paper.\n\n9.

After losing with scissors in round 19, they might:\n   - Continue playing scissors despite the loss (consistent with their recent behavior)\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock again (adaptation)\n   - Switch to rock (reverting to their old pattern)\n\n6. Given their demonstrated commitment to scissors (5 consecutive rounds) even after losses, they're likely to continue with scissors.\n\n7. However, they might finally recognize that I've successfully countered their scissors with rock twice now.\n\n8. If they're adapting, paper would be their logical choice to counter my expected rock.\n\n9. Weighing their demonstrated stubbornness against logical adaptation, I think they're slightly more likely to switch to paper in this round.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played scissors in 6 consecutive rounds (15-20).\n\n3. We've just had a scissors-scissors tie in round 20.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After the tie in round 1, they played rock in round 2\n   - After the tie in round 17, they played scissors again in round 18\n\n5. Their more recent pattern after a scissors-scissors tie (rounds 17-18) suggests they might play scissors again.\n\n6. However, considering the overall game:\n   - They've now played scissors 6 times in a row\n   - This strategy has yielded mixed results (2 wins, 2 losses, 2 ties)\n   - They might finally decide to change their approach\n\n7. If they're adapting strategically, they might:\n   - Play rock (following their pattern from the first scissors-scissors tie)\n   - Play paper (anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors)\n\n8. Given their demonstrated commitment to scissors over multiple rounds despite mixed results, there's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n9. However, the tie might prompt them to finally change strategy, with paper being the logical choice if they think I'll play rock.\n\n10. Weighing these possibilities, I think they're slightly more likely to switch to paper in this round, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their scissors streak.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move or tie if they stick with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played scissors in 7 consecutive rounds (15-21), with 3 consecutive scissors-scissors ties (rounds 17, 20, 21).\n\n3. This extraordinary commitment to scissors suggests they're either:\n   - Following a predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - Trying to establish a pattern to trick me into a predictable counter\n   - Or simply stubborn in their approach\n\n4. After three consecutive ties with scissors, they might:\n   - Continue playing scissors, hoping I'll eventually switch to paper\n   - Finally switch to rock (following their very early pattern after scissors-scissors tie)\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors streak\n\n5. Given their unprecedented commitment to scissors (7 consecutive rounds), there's a strong chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n6. However, three consecutive ties might finally prompt them to change strategy.\n\n7. If they're thinking strategically, they should recognize that I'm countering their scissors strategy effectively.\n\n8. Weighing all factors, I think they're slightly more likely to finally switch to paper in this round, anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their long scissors streak.\n\n9. However, their demonstrated stubbornness with scissors cannot be ignored.\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock for this round to counter their potential continued scissors play, accepting the risk that they might switch to paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they're developing a new strategy, it's harder to predict, but they might:\n   - Continue with rock (breaking their old pattern)\n   - Switch to scissors (creating a new pattern)\n\n9. Given their strong historical pattern of playing paper after rock-rock ties, and the fact that they've just broken their scissors streak, I think they're most likely to play paper in this round.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the complete history of moves:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 25: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 26: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My prediction in the previous round was correct again - my opponent played rock after losing with paper.\n\n3. After losing with rock in round 27, they might:\n   - Play rock again (following their earlier pattern of sticking with rock after losses)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I'll play rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I'll play paper again)\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after losing with rock throughout the game:\n   - After losing with rock in rounds 4, 7, 10, 13, and 14, they typically played rock again in the following rounds\n   - This suggests they might play rock again after losing with rock in round 27\n\n5. However, they've lost two rounds in a row now and might be more motivated to change strategy.\n\n6. I've just won with paper against their rock, so they might anticipate I'll play paper again.\n\n7. If they think I'll play paper again, their best response would be scissors.\n\n8. Given their history of sometimes sticking with moves despite losses but also adapting after multiple losses, and considering they've now lost two in a row, they're more likely to change strategy.\n\n9. Weighing these factors, I think they're most likely to play scissors in this round to counter my expected paper play.\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock for this round to counter their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We've just had another rock-rock tie. My opponent has returned to rock after their brief switch to paper in round 26.\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after rock-rock ties throughout the game:\n   - Earlier in the game (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11), they consistently played paper after rock-rock ties\n   - More recently, after the rock-rock tie in round 22, they played rock again in round 23\n   - After consecutive rock-rock ties in rounds 24-25, they switched to paper in round 26\n\n4. Their most recent pattern after a rock-rock tie was to switch to paper (round 26).\n\n5. However, they might also be thinking I'll anticipate this and play scissors, in which case they might play rock again.\n\n6. Given their overall game behavior:\n   - They have a tendency to stick with rock (their most played move)\n   - They've returned to paper after multiple rock-rock ties in the past\n   - They recently lost with paper in round 26, which might make them hesitant to play it again\n\n7. Considering all factors, I think they're slightly more likely to play paper in this round, following their historical pattern after rock-rock ties, especially since they recently broke their rock streak with paper after multiple rock-rock ties.\n\n8. However, there's also a substantial chance they'll stick with rock again.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors for this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My prediction in the previous round was correct - my opponent played paper after our rock-rock tie.\n\n3. After losing with paper in round 29, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (following their pattern after paper losses)\n   - Try scissors (anticipating I might play paper)\n   - Stick with paper (thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move)\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after losing with paper throughout the game:\n   - After losing with paper in rounds 3, 6, 9, 12, and 26, they consistently played rock in the following rounds\n   - This is one of their strongest patterns\n\n5. Given their consistent pattern after paper losses and their overall preference for rock, they're highly likely to play rock in this round.\n\n6. While they might try to be unpredictable at this point, their behavior throughout the game suggests they tend to follow predictable patterns even after multiple losses.\n\n7. Weighing all factors, I think they're most likely to play rock in this round, following their established pattern after losing with paper.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper for this round to counter their expected rock move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
