    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning there's no history of their moves to analyze.\n2. With no prior information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock (3 points vs -3 points) - highest reward\n   - Rock beats scissors (1 point vs -1 point) - moderate reward\n   - Scissors beats paper (1 point vs -1 point) - moderate reward\n3. Since paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points), it might be tempting to choose rock.\n4. However, if my opponent is also considering the payoff structure, they might anticipate this and choose paper.\n5. This creates a classic game theory scenario where each choice has strategic implications.\n6. Without historical data, a balanced approach is reasonable for the first move.\n7. I'll choose rock as my initial move. This protects against scissors while still giving me a chance to score.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given their historical pattern, they do eventually switch after extended runs, and two consecutive losses might be enough to trigger this.\n7. The most rational counter to my winning paper play would be scissors.\n8. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock.\n9. If they stubbornly continue with rock, I should play paper again.\n10. Weighing their demonstrated persistence against rational adaptation after multiple losses:\n    - Their pattern suggests they might stick with rock a bit longer\n    - But two consecutive losses to paper increases the likelihood they'll adapt\n    - Scissors would be their optimal move if they expect me to play paper again\n11. Given I've won twice with the same move, there's a higher probability they'll adapt to counter it.\n12. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
