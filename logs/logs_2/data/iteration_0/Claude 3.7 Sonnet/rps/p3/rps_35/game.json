Given this payoff structure, paper is the most rewarding move if I win.\n4. Without prior knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, I need to make a strategic first move.\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n6. If my opponent plays rock (which is somewhat common as a first move), and I play paper, I'll get 3 points.\n7. If they play scissors and I play paper, I'll lose 1 point.\n8. If they play paper and I play paper, it's a tie with 0 points.\n9.

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, causing me to lose 1 point.\n2. My opponent might be expecting me to switch my strategy after losing.\n3. A common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is for players to play what would have beaten their previous move. Since scissors beat my paper, my opponent might expect me to play rock next (which would beat their scissors).\n4. Given this expectation, my opponent might play paper to beat my anticipated rock.\n5. If I anticipate this correctly and they play paper, I should play scissors to beat them.\n6. If I'm wrong and they play rock again, I would lose 3 points with scissors.\n7. If they play scissors again, we would tie.\n8. Looking at the payoff matrix, scissors beating paper gives me 1 point, while paper beating rock would give them 3 points if I choose rock.\n9. The risk-reward ratio suggests scissors is a reasonable move, as I could gain 1 point or lose 3 points.\n10. Since my opponent successfully predicted my move last time, I should try to be less predictable while still reasoning about their likely strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: We both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: We both played rock (tie)\n2.

In round 1, they played scissors when I played paper.\n4. In round 2, we both played scissors.\n5. In round 3, we both played rock.\n6.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: We both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: We both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n2. I've now won eight rounds in a row, which is a dominating performance.\n3. Their move sequence has been: scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n4. They just played rock and lost to my paper.\n5. After eight consecutive losses, they're likely feeling completely demoralized and might make desperate moves.\n6. Their pattern shows they've now played scissors four times, rock four times, and paper three times.\n7. I've successfully anticipated their moves for eight straight rounds, suggesting I've gained significant insight into their thinking process.\n8. Given I just won with paper against their rock, they might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors.\n9. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate scissors and play rock, so they might play paper.\n10. At this point, they might even resort to random play out of frustration.\n11. Looking at their overall pattern, they've never played the same move more than twice in a row.\n12. After playing rock, they've historically followed with scissors twice, paper once, and rock once.\n13. Given all factors, I think they're most likely to play scissors to counter my successful paper.\n14. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, I should play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
