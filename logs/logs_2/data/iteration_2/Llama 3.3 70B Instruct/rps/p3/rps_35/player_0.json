Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering all the rounds, my opponent has made the moves scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, and scissors, resulting in a loss, a win, a win, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a tie, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, a loss, and a loss for them, respectively.\n4. I have three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n5. Each move has a different payoff:\n   - rock beats scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-3 points), and ties with rock (0 points).\n   - paper beats rock (+3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point), and ties with paper (0 points).\n   - scissors beats paper (+1 point), loses to rock (-1 point), and ties with scissors (0 points).\n6. Given that my opponent has made the move scissors ten times and lost all ten times, they may try to make a different move this time to avoid being countered again.\n7. However, considering the previous rounds, my opponent may still try to make a move that beats rock, which is paper.\n8. A possible strategy for me would be to make a move that takes advantage of my opponent's potential tendency to try to counter my previous move or avoid being countered.\n9. To counter this, I should choose a move that is likely to beat paper, which is scissors.\n10. Since I have been successful with rock in the previous round and my opponent has lost with scissors, I should consider making a move that has a relatively high payoff and is likely to be successful against my opponent's potential moves.\n\n[move] (Trying to make a move that takes into account the previous rounds' outcomes and potential opponent strategy) scissors\n"
