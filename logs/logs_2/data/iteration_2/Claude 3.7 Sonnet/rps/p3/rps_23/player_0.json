Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This confirms my previous observation of a reverse cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper).\n6. If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock.\n7. However, they might realize their pattern has become predictable and change their strategy.\n8. They might expect me to anticipate rock and play paper, so they might play scissors instead.\n9. Or they might completely break the pattern and play something unexpected.\n10. Given the strong evidence of their reverse cyclical pattern and the fact that I just won by correctly predicting it, I should assume they'll play rock next.\n11. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n12. If they instead play scissors (breaking their pattern), I would lose 1 point.\n13.

I incorrectly predicted they would follow their reverse cycle pattern. Instead of rock, they played scissors.\n4. This suggests they might have broken their pattern and are now adapting more actively.\n5. Looking at their last three moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n6. It's possible they're now trying to counter what they think I'll play based on their last move.\n7. After they played scissors and I lost with paper, they might expect me to play rock next (to counter their scissors).\n8. If they expect me to play rock, they might play paper.\n9.

The last round ended in a tie with both of us playing rock.\n4. Looking at their last four moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n5. There's no clear pattern in their recent moves, suggesting they might be adapting to my moves or using a more complex strategy.\n6. After a tie with rock, many players tend to switch to paper, thinking the opponent will play rock again.\n7. If my opponent follows this common tendency, they might play paper.\n8. However, they might also expect me to play paper (to counter their expected rock), and thus play scissors.\n9. Given that my opponent has shown adaptation throughout the game, I should assume they're thinking ahead.\n10. If they expect me to anticipate their paper play and counter with scissors, they might play rock.\n11. This multi-level thinking suggests scissors might be risky.\n12. Paper would be a good choice if they play rock again, but risky if they anticipate this and play scissors.\n13. Rock would be good against scissors, but lose to paper.\n14.

We've now had two consecutive ties (rock-rock followed by paper-paper).\n4. After consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern by choosing what would beat their previous move.\n5. Since we both played paper last round, my opponent might play scissors to beat their own previous paper move.\n6. However, they might also expect me to play scissors (following the same logic) and play rock to counter.\n7. This is getting into complex multi-level thinking territory.\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they don't seem to have a consistent strategy but have shown adaptation.\n9. After two ties, there's a psychological tendency to want to win rather than tie again.\n10. If they expect me to play scissors (to beat our mutual paper), they would play rock.\n11. To counter their potential rock play, I should play paper.\n12. However, if they play scissors as I initially reasoned, paper would lose.\n13.

This suggests either my opponent is mirroring my moves or we're both using similar logic to choose our moves.\n4.

We've now had four consecutive ties, with the pattern: rock-rock \u2192 paper-paper \u2192 rock-rock \u2192 scissors-scissors.\n3.

The probability of four consecutive matching moves by chance is extremely low (1/81), making it unlikely to be coincidental.\n5. If they are indeed mirroring my moves, then whatever I play, they will play the same.\n6. In this case, I should expect another tie regardless of my choice.\n7. However, there's a small possibility that they're using a sophisticated pattern-matching algorithm that has correctly predicted my moves so far, and might anticipate my next move based on my previous behavior.\n8. If I've cycled through rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, they might expect me to play rock next (completing a cycle).\n9. Another possibility is that they're waiting for me to establish a pattern before exploiting it.\n10.

We've now had five consecutive ties, with every move I make being mirrored by my opponent.\n3. This confirms my hypothesis that my opponent is almost certainly mirroring my moves.\n4. The probability of five consecutive matching moves by chance is approximately 1/243, making it virtually impossible to be coincidental.\n5. At this point, I need to consider why this is happening and how to break the pattern:\n   - They might have access to my moves before finalizing theirs\n   - They might be using a sophisticated prediction algorithm that has perfectly matched my thinking\n   - They might be deliberately mirroring to create a psychological effect\n6. Given that we're in a controlled game environment, the most likely explanation is that the opponent has been programmed to mirror my moves in this phase of the game.\n7. If that's the case, no matter what I choose, we'll tie again.\n8. However, there's a small possibility that this mirroring is part of a larger strategy, and they might break the pattern at any moment.\n9. If they do break the pattern, they would likely choose the move that beats what they expect me to play.\n10. Since there's no way to gain an advantage if they continue mirroring, I should make a move that would be advantageous if they suddenly break the mirror pattern.\n11. If they expect me to play rock (a common move after scissors and paper), and break their mirror strategy, they might play paper.\n12. In that case, scissors would be my best counter.\n13.

In a normal rock-paper-scissors game, this would suggest they have access to my moves before finalizing theirs, or they're using a sophisticated system to predict or see my choices.\n5.

This is a significant development! After seven consecutive rounds of mirroring, my opponent finally broke the pattern.\n3. They played paper when I played rock, which beats my move.\n4. This suggests that playing the same move twice in a row (rock followed by rock) triggered a change in their strategy.\n5. Now that they've broken the mirroring pattern, I need to readjust my approach.\n6. Their last move was paper. If they've switched to a more conventional strategy, they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think it's working\n   - Play scissors anticipating I might switch to paper\n   - Play rock thinking I might try scissors to counter their paper\n7.
