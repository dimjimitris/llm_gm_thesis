    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I've completely decoded their pattern - they reliably follow the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle regardless of the outcomes.\n\nSince I just played paper and won against their rock, I'll now play scissors. Following the established pattern, my opponent will likely play paper after their rock, and my scissors will beat their paper.\n\nMy winning formula continues to be:\n1. Consider their previous move (rock)\n2. Anticipate they'll follow standard progression (paper follows rock)\n3. Play the counter to their anticipated move (scissors beats paper)\n\nThis approach has earned me a perfect winning streak with a combination of 1-point and 3-point victories.
