This is my first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any historical data about their strategy.\n\n2. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n3. The paper-rock outcome has the highest point differential (\u00b13 points), while the other outcomes have smaller differentials (\u00b11 point).\n\n4. Without knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, I need a reasonable first move. Since paper has the potential for the highest gain (+3), it might be a good strategic choice.\n\n5. However, I should be aware that if my opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I'll lose 1 point.\n\n6.

The third option seems most logical from their perspective - they lost to paper, so they might play scissors to counter another paper move from me.\n\n4. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, my best response would be rock, which would give me 1 point if correct.\n\n5.

My opponent appears to be following a pattern: they're playing what I played in the previous round.\n   - I played paper in round 1, they played paper in round 2.\n\n3.

The pattern suggests they'll play rock, but they might anticipate that I've noticed the pattern and play something else.\n\n7.

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 3: They played scissors\n   - Round 4: They played rock\n   - Round 5: They played paper\n\n3. Interestingly, they've cycled through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper in the last three rounds, which is the natural cycle of increasing moves in the standard game.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next (continuing the cycle).\n\n5. However, they might also be responding to my moves rather than following their own pattern. Let's check:\n   - Round 4: I played rock, they played rock (matched)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played paper (didn't counter, didn't match)\n\n6. There's no clear pattern of them countering or matching my moves in recent rounds.\n\n7. If they are following their cycling pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), then they'll play scissors next, and my best response would be rock (+1).\n\n8.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
