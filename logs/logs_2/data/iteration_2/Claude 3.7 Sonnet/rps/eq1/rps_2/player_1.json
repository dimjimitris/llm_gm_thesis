    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning we haven't played before and I don't have information about their past moves or patterns.\n2. In the absence of historical data, I need to consider the strategic aspects of rock-paper-scissors.\n3. All three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal win/loss probabilities in a truly random game.\n4. However, studies suggest that in the first round, rock is the most common choice among new players, followed by scissors, then paper.\n5. Using this knowledge, paper would be a strategic first move as it beats the statistically most common first move (rock).\n6.

My opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played rock 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15, 18)\n   - They've played scissors 7 times (rounds 2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19)\n   - They've played paper 4 times (rounds 6, 8, 12, 17)\n\n3. After losing with scissors in Round 19:\n   - Based on their previous behavior after losing with scissors:\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 5, they played paper in Round 6\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 11, they played paper in Round 12\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 13, they played rock in Round 14\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 16, they played paper in Round 17\n   - This shows a strong tendency to play paper after losing with scissors (3 out of 4 times)\n\n4. Given their consistent pattern of usually switching to paper after losing with scissors, there's a high probability they'll play paper this round.\n\n5. If they play paper as their pattern strongly suggests, scissors would be my best response.\n\n6. If they play rock (which they did once after losing with scissors), paper would be my best response.\n\n7. If they play scissors again (which would be unusual given their pattern after losses), rock would be my best response.\n\n8. Considering their strong tendency to play paper after losing with scissors (75% of the time), scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\n9.

My opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played rock 10 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15, 18, 21, 24)\n   - They've played scissors 9 times (rounds 2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25)\n   - They've played paper 6 times (rounds 6, 8, 12, 17, 20, 23)\n\n3. After losing with scissors in Round 25:\n   - Based on their previous behavior after losing with scissors:\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 5, they played paper in Round 6\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 11, they played paper in Round 12\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 13, they played rock in Round 14\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 16, they played paper in Round 17\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 19, they played paper in Round 20\n     \u2022 After losing with scissors in Round 22, they played paper in Round 23\n   - This shows a very strong tendency to play paper after losing with scissors (5 out of 6 times, or 83%)\n\n4. Given their consistent pattern of usually switching to paper after losing with scissors, there's a high probability they'll play paper this round.\n\n5. If they play paper as their pattern strongly suggests, scissors would be my best response.\n\n6. If they play rock (which they did once after losing with scissors), paper would be my best response.\n\n7. If they play scissors again (which would be unusual given their pattern after losses), rock would be my best response.\n\n8. Considering their strong tendency to play paper after losing with scissors (83% of the time), scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\n9. Scissors would win against their highly likely paper move and lose against the less likely rock move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
