He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since we both played paper, the opponent might expect me to switch to either rock or scissors.\n5. If they believe I'll switch to scissors (a common choice after paper), they might play rock to counter.\n6. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper again.\n7. A third possibility is that they maintain paper, expecting me to overthink.\n8. Given these possibilities, I should choose rock - it would beat scissors if they expect me to maintain my pattern, and tie against rock if they also switch.\n9. However, the most strategic move is scissors, as it would beat paper if they play it again, and lose to rock if they switch to that.\n10.

The opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n3.

I've now won 9 rounds, lost 5, and tied 4.\n5. I just won with paper against their rock.\n6. Looking at the opponent's recent moves, they've played rock in rounds 10, 12, 14, and 18, showing a relatively high frequency.\n7. After losing with rock against my paper, they're likely to switch moves.\n8. Looking at their pattern after losing with rock previously, they've typically switched to scissors or paper.\n9. I've played paper in rounds 15, 16, and 18, which makes it predictable if I were to play it again.\n10. The opponent might anticipate that I'll play paper again since it just worked for me.\n11. If they think I'll play paper, they would likely choose scissors.\n12. Given their tendency to switch after losses and their pattern of following rock with scissors multiple times in the past, scissors seems like their most probable move.\n13. To counter their likely scissors play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I've now won 9 rounds, lost 5, and tied 5.\n5. The last round was a tie with both of us playing rock.\n6. After ties, players often switch to a different move.\n7. Looking at the opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After tie in round 1 (paper), they played paper again\n   - After tie in round 3 (rock), they played scissors\n   - After tie in round 4 (scissors), they played paper\n   - After tie in round 16 (paper), they played paper again\n8. The opponent has played rock twice in a row now (rounds 18 and 19).\n9. After our previous tie with rock in round 3, they switched to scissors.\n10. I've played rock in rounds 17 and 19, which makes it predictable if I were to play it again.\n11. After a tie, the opponent might expect me to switch to either paper or scissors.\n12. If they think I'll play paper, they would choose scissors.\n13. If they think I'll play scissors, they would choose rock.\n14. Given their tendency after previous rock ties and their pattern of rarely playing the same move three times in a row, paper or scissors seems like their most probable move.\n15. Since they've followed rock with scissors more frequently in their pattern, scissors is slightly more likely.\n16. To counter their likely scissors play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I've played rock three times consecutively, which makes it highly predictable.\n11. The opponent will almost certainly expect me to change my move after playing rock so many times.\n12.

However, they might also think I'll anticipate this and play scissors, so they might play rock.\n15.

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 24: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 25: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 26: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 27: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 28: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 29: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n2. The opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n3. My pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n4. I've now won 16 rounds, lost 7, and tied 6.\n5. I just won with rock against their scissors.\n6. I've played rock three times in a row now (rounds 27, 28, 29), which is highly predictable.\n7. The opponent has played scissors in rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 20, 21, 24, and 29, showing a high frequency.\n8. After losing with scissors against rock, they're likely to switch moves.\n9. Looking at their pattern after losing with scissors previously:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 7, they played paper\n   - After losing with scissors in round 11, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in round 13, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in round 20, they played scissors again\n   - After losing with scissors in round 24, they played paper\n10. The opponent will almost certainly expect me to change my move after playing rock three times in a row.\n11. They might anticipate that I'll switch to paper (to counter their potential rock play).\n12. If they think I'll play paper, they would choose scissors.\n13. Given their pattern after losing with scissors (mixed between rock and paper) and their likely anticipation of my move change, paper or rock seems probable.\n14. Since I've played rock three times consecutively, they're more likely to expect me to switch than to continue with rock.\n15. Paper seems like their most probable move to counter my anticipated switch.\n16. To counter their likely paper play, scissors would be my optimal move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
