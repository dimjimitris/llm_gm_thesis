I need to consider both possibilities:\n   a) If they play scissors, I should play rock to win\n   b) If they play paper again, I should play scissors to win\n7. Based on common rock-paper-scissors psychology, players often don't repeat the same move after winning, preferring to \"upgrade\" to the next move in the sequence.\n8.

After winning with paper, they may:\n   a) Stick with paper since it just worked\n   b) Anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they'll play rock\n   c) Try to be unpredictable and play scissors\n\n6. Given that they've won with paper twice now (rounds 2 and 12), they might see it as their second-best strategy.\n\n7. People tend to repeat strategies that have recently succeeded, especially after a long losing streak.\n\n8. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect them to repeat paper and counter with scissors.\n\n9.

My opponent's complete move history: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock.\n\n3. They've now played rock 12 times (60%), paper 6 times (30%), and scissors twice (10%).\n\n4. We just had a tie with both of us playing rock.\n\n5. Their last four moves have been rock, showing a very strong recent preference for their most common move.\n\n6. After ties with rock, they've historically either:\n   a) Played rock again (as in rounds 10 and 17)\n   b) Switched to paper (as in round 3)\n\n7. Given that they've played rock four times in a row now, this suggests they're either:\n   a) Strongly committed to playing rock regardless of outcomes\n   b) Due for a change after so many consecutive rock plays\n\n8. The fact that they've stuck with rock through wins, losses, and ties in the last four rounds suggests they may be deliberately playing rock repeatedly as a strategy.\n\n9. However, after four consecutive rock plays, they might feel their pattern has become too predictable.\n\n10. If they do switch, paper would be their next most common move historically.\n\n11. Weighing these factors, I believe they're slightly more likely to finally switch away from rock after four consecutive plays, with paper being the most probable alternative.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After multiple consecutive ties with the same move, players typically feel compelled to change their strategy.\n\n6. My opponent has shown a pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds (4 rocks in a row, now 3 papers in a row).\n\n7. Given the monotony of three consecutive paper ties, they're likely feeling pressure to switch.\n\n8. Their most common move historically is rock, which they might return to.\n\n9.

Given their historical preference for rock as their default move and the psychological pressure to break the tie streak, I think they're more likely to switch to either rock or scissors, with rock being slightly more probable given their overall pattern.\n\n11.

They've now played rock 12 times (44%), paper 11 times (41%), and scissors 4 times (15%).\n\n4. They just lost with paper against my scissors.\n\n5. Their recent pattern has been paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, showing a clear alternating pattern between paper and scissors.\n\n6. After losing with paper, they have historically:\n   a) Switched to rock (as in rounds 7, 9, 11, 19)\n   b) Stuck with paper (as in rounds 14, 16, 22, 23)\n   c) Switched to scissors (as in round 15)\n\n7. Given their recent alternating pattern between paper and scissors, the next move in that pattern would be scissors.\n\n8. However, they've just lost with paper, and historically have often switched to rock after losing with paper.\n\n9. Additionally, they might anticipate that I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors, so they might play paper.\n\n10. Weighing these factors:\n    - Their historical tendency to switch to rock after losing with paper\n    - Their recent alternating pattern suggesting scissors\n    - The psychological impact of three consecutive losses\n\n11. I believe they're more likely to break their recent alternating pattern and revert to their most common move historically - rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've now played rock 12 times (43%), paper 12 times (43%), and scissors 4 times (14%).\n\n4. We just had another tie with paper, which was their sixth tie with paper overall.\n\n5. Their recent pattern has been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper, showing they've moved away from their previous alternating pattern.\n\n6. After ties with paper, they have historically:\n   a) Stuck with paper again (as in rounds 22-23)\n   b) Switched to rock (as in round 17)\n   c) Switched to scissors (as in round 24)\n\n7. Given that they just played paper twice in a row, and we've had multiple paper ties throughout the game, they might feel compelled to switch.\n\n8. Their most recent pattern when switching from paper has been to scissors (as in rounds 24 and 26).\n\n9. Additionally, they might anticipate that I'll play scissors to counter their paper, so they might play rock.\n\n10. Weighing these factors:\n    - Their tendency to eventually switch after multiple ties\n    - Their recent pattern of switching to scissors after paper\n    - The psychological factor of breaking a tie\n\n11. I believe they're more likely to switch to either rock or scissors, with scissors being slightly more probable based on their recent patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played rock 12 times (41%), paper 12 times (41%), and scissors 5 times (17%).\n\n4. They just lost with scissors against my rock for the third time in the game.\n\n5. After losing with scissors, they have historically:\n   a) Switched to rock (as in round 9)\n   b) Switched to paper (as in rounds 16, 25, 28)\n   c) Never played scissors twice in a row after losing with it\n\n6. Their recent pattern has been paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, showing they've been cycling through different moves.\n\n7. They've now lost with scissors 3 times in the last 6 rounds (rounds 24, 26, 29).\n\n8. Given their historical pattern after losing with scissors and their overall game history, they're most likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\n9. Between these two options:\n   - They've shown a recent preference for paper (12 of the last 17 rounds)\n   - After losing with scissors, they've more frequently switched to paper than rock\n\n10. Taking into account their historical patterns, recent moves, and psychological factors after repeated losses with scissors, I believe they are more likely to switch to paper this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
