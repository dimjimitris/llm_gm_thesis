Pattern consideration:\n   * Rock worked until I abandoned it\n   * Simple strategy was better than complex\n   * Opponent rewards simple plays\n   * Punishes overthinking\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * They just won with rock\n   * They might:\n     - Keep rock (showing confidence)\n     - Switch to paper (expecting my rock)\n     - Switch to scissors (expecting mind games)\n   * I need to:\n     - Stop overthinking\n     - Return to basics\n     - Make the obvious play\n\n[move] paper (Making the straightforward counter to their successful rock play. I'm done overthinking. Sometimes the obvious move is the right move. They've been rewarding simple, logical plays and punishing complex strategies)\n"
