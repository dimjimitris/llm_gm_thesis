Analyzing ties:\n   - Both times we tied, it was with paper\n   - Last time after a paper tie (Round 1), they stuck with paper\n   - This created a pattern that worked for them initially\n\n3. Psychological consideration:\n   - They might recognize the similarity to the game's start\n   - But they also know I might remember their previous paper repeat\n   - They've shown they can adapt and change strategies\n   - The tie gave them a \"breather\" from losing streak\n\n4. Risk analysis:\n   - If they repeat paper (like early game): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they expect scissors from me and play rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play scissors expecting my paper: rock wins (+1)\n   - Their most predictable pattern involves paper moves\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their frequent paper usage\n   - And the parallel to the game's opening\n   - But knowing they know I know their patterns\n   - Scissors is still the most logical choice\n   - It beats their most common move (paper)\n   - And if they switch to rock, we only lose 1 point vs paper's 3\n\n[move] scissors Their paper plays have been consistent enough to risk scissors here, while minimizing potential losses.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
