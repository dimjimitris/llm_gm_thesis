    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyzer - For evaluating potential outcomes and risks\n3. Pattern Observer - For tracking and analyzing opponent behavior\n4. Decision Maker (myself) - For making the final move decision\n\nLet's collaborate:\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy. The payoff matrix shows that paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Since we don't know the opponent's tendencies, we should consider a balanced approach. Rock is often a common first move for many players as it feels \"safe\" and \"strong.\" If we predict they'll play rock, paper would give us the maximum gain.\n\nPattern Observer: Without any historical data, we can only rely on general human psychology. Many players tend to start with rock in their first move, as the Risk Analyzer mentioned.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on the analysis:\n1. Paper gives us the highest potential reward (3 points)\n2. Many players start with rock\n3. While paper is risky against scissors, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this initial round\n\n[move] paper - Playing paper to capitalize on the tendency of new players to start with rock, while accepting the calculated risk of losing to scissors.\n"

After such a loss, players often change their strategy. They might either:\n1. Switch to what beat them (paper)\n2. Switch to what would have beaten what beat them (scissors)\nThe second option is more likely as it would give them a sense of \"revenge\" against our paper play.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated they're willing to play straightforward moves (rock). However, after losing -3 points, they're highly likely to adapt their strategy. The psychological impact of a significant loss often leads to more aggressive counter-strategies.\n\nRisk Analyzer: Given our successful paper play, the opponent is very unlikely to play rock again. The most threatening response would be scissors, which they might choose to counter our previous paper play. If we believe they'll play scissors, we should play rock.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis suggests:\n1. The opponent is likely to switch strategies after a significant loss\n2. They have a strong incentive to play scissors to counter our previous paper\n3. The safest and most logical counter would be rock, which would both protect against the likely scissors play and give us a positive point score if correct\n\n[move] rock - Anticipating a scissors play from our opponent as a counter to our previous successful paper move.\n"

Second round: Scissors (lost -1)\nThey've shown a progression and have lost twice. Their confidence might be shaken, and they've demonstrated a tendency to switch moves after losses.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has displayed a predictable pattern of changing moves after losses, moving from rock \u2192 scissors. Following this pattern, they might play paper next. However, they might also realize we've been reading their moves well and try to break their own pattern.\n\nRisk Analyzer: The opponent has lost 4 points total (-3, -1) and might be getting frustrated. In such situations, players often:\n1. Return to basic moves (like rock) as a \"reset\"\n2. Try to be unpredictable by breaking patterns\n3. Try to anticipate our next move based on our success pattern (rock\u2192paper)\n\nDecision Maker: Considering:\n1. The opponent has lost twice and might be frustrated\n2.

After a tie, players often feel more comfortable making aggressive moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown a pattern of:\n- Switching moves after losses\n- But keeping the same move after a tie\nThis suggests two possibilities:\n1. They might stick with rock again since the tie didn't punish them\n2. They might feel this is a good time to switch to paper, thinking we'll play rock again\n\nRisk Analyzer: \n- If they stay with rock: Paper would win (+3)\n- If they switch to paper: Scissors would win (+1)\n- If they switch to scissors: Rock would win (+1)\nThe highest risk-reward play would be paper, but they've already lost significantly to paper in round 1.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's consider:\n1.
