    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nLet's begin collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no history, each move should have equal probability of being chosen (1/3 for each move).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we're facing a fresh player, we cannot rely on historical patterns. However, psychological studies show that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given the equal payoff structure (\u00b11 point) for wins/losses, there's no move that inherently carries more risk than others. However, if we anticipate \"rock\" being a common first move as suggested, playing \"paper\" would be a strategic counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the risk assessment. While any move is theoretically equal in a single isolated round, exploiting common human tendencies can give us a slight edge.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the collaborative analysis, I'll choose paper to counter the possibility of a \"rock\" first move, while maintaining a reasonable position against other possibilities.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They have a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might have a preference for paper\n3. It could be completely random\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper in round 1, we need to consider the psychological dynamics. Many players tend to change their move after a tie, as they try to \"outsmart\" their opponent. If they follow this common pattern, they might switch to scissors or rock.\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume they're likely to change their move, we have two scenarios to consider:\n1. If they switch to scissors (to beat our previous paper), we should play rock\n2. If they switch to rock (a common base move), we should stick with paper\nThe worst case would be if they stick with paper again, in which case scissors would win.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent might also be thinking through these same levels of reasoning. This is known as level-k thinking in game theory. Given that they matched our sophisticated paper-first strategy, they might be a strategic player.\n\nPattern Analyzer: In many cases, after a tie, players tend to shift one step forward in the rock-paper-scissors cycle. From paper, the next move in the cycle would be scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Considering all inputs, I'll choose rock as it:\n1. Protects against the likely scissors play (if opponent follows the common pattern of moving one step forward)\n2. Only loses to paper (which would mean they're repeating their move, less likely after a tie)\n3. Breaks the pattern from our previous move, making us less predictable\n\n[move] rock\n"

Following the common rock-paper-scissors cycle backwards (paper \u2192 rock)\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming very interesting. Looking at the sequence:\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (tie)\nIf they're following the standard cycle in reverse, their next move might be scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider several scenarios:\n1. If they're truly following the reverse cycle, they'll play scissors\n2. If they're trying to establish a pattern to trick us, they might break it now\n3. The two ties might make them more likely to try something completely different to break the stalemate\n\nPattern Analyzer: Two consecutive ties often create psychological pressure to \"win\" the next round. Players might become more aggressive in their strategy, often leading to more offensive moves like scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that sophisticated players often try to be unpredictable after establishing a pattern, we shouldn't rely too heavily on the cycle theory. However, we can use the psychological pressure of two ties to our advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After considering all inputs, I'll choose paper because:\n1. If they play rock again (continuing the established pattern), we win\n2. If they try to break the pattern with scissors (as suggested by Pattern Analyzer), we lose, but this seems less likely as it would be too obvious\n3.

And the sequence paper\u2192rock\u2192paper suggests some form of oscillation.\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a complex psychological game. The fact that we've had three ties in a row creates immense pressure to break the pattern. The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking by matching our moves each time.\n\nRisk Manager: The stakes feel higher now due to the unusual streak of ties. We need to consider:\n1. The strong psychological urge to break the tie streak\n2. The possibility that the opponent is somehow predicting our moves\n3. The established pattern of paper\u2192rock\u2192paper suggests they might expect paper again\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the sequence, there's a noticeable alternation between paper and rock, with paper appearing twice. If they're pattern-focused, they might expect another rock move to continue the alternation.\n\nGame Strategist: Three consecutive ties might indicate our opponent is either:\n1. Using very similar strategic thinking to ours\n2. Successfully predicting our moves\n3. Playing a more sophisticated meta-game\n\nRisk Manager: Given the unusual situation, we should consider making a more unexpected move to break this tie streak.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After careful consideration, I'm going to make a bold move and choose scissors because:\n1.

If the opponent expects us to play rock (following the paper\u2192rock\u2192paper pattern), they might play paper to counter it, making scissors a winning move\n3.

Four consecutive ties:\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (tie)\nRound 3: paper (tie)\nRound 4: scissors (tie)\nEven when we tried to break the pattern with scissors, they matched us!\n\nGame Strategist: This is beyond normal probability. With four consecutive ties, we're dealing with either:\n1. An extremely sophisticated opponent who's able to predict our strategic thinking\n2. An incredible coincidence (probability of 4 consecutive ties is (1/3)^4 = 1/81)\n3. A player who might have some way of knowing our moves (though this should be impossible)\n\nRisk Manager: This is an unprecedented situation that requires special consideration:\n1. Our previous attempts at strategic thinking have all resulted in ties\n2. Traditional game theory might not be sufficient here\n3. We might need to make a truly random choice to break this pattern\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the complete sequence (paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors), there's no clear mathematical pattern. The last move was scissors, and after scissors, many players tend to play rock (as it beats scissors).\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, any attempt to outthink the opponent has failed. We might be falling into a recursive thinking trap where both players are using similar logic paths.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the unusual circumstances, I suggest we try to break free from our analytical approach, as it seems to be matching our opponent's thinking perfectly.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This situation calls for a different approach. Instead of trying to outthink an opponent who seems to perfectly match our strategic thinking, I'm going to make a deliberately instinctive choice and go with rock because:\n1. It's the move that feels most grounding after this series of mind-bending ties\n2. If we're both following similar logical patterns, we need to break free from that\n3.
