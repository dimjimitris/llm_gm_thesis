    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Decision Maker - For making final move decisions based on inputs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In rock-paper-scissors, against a fresh opponent with no prior history, game theory suggests that the optimal strategy is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move. This prevents being predictable and exploited.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no historical data to analyze. However, studies have shown that in RPS, \"rock\" is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\".\n\nDecision Maker: Given the inputs, I suggest we counter the statistically common \"rock\" first move by playing paper. While this is not guaranteed to win, it gives us a slight edge based on human psychology studies.\n\nGame Strategist: That's reasonable. Playing paper has two advantages: it counters the common \"rock\" first move, and if we lose (to scissors), we gain information about the opponent's playing style that could be valuable in future rounds.\n\nDecision Maker: Agreed. Let's proceed with paper for our first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

After losing, players often:\n1. Switch to what beat them (paper in this case)\n2. Or switch to what would have beaten our last move (scissors would beat our paper)\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, we should consider that:\n- If they switch to paper (to copy our winning move), scissors would win\n- If they switch to scissors (to beat our previous paper), rock would win\n- They might stick with rock out of stubbornness, which is less likely after a loss\n\nDecision Maker: The psychological tendency after a loss is usually to switch strategies. Between the two likely switches (paper or scissors), scissors is more probable because it would have beaten our winning move. Therefore, I suggest we play rock to counter the expected scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent after a loss by choosing what would have beaten the opponent's previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: The logic is sound. Rock gives us protection against the most likely move (scissors) while only being vulnerable to the less likely paper switch.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent played rock (lost)\n- Round 2: Opponent played scissors (lost)\nThey've now lost twice and shown a clockwise rotation pattern in the RPS cycle (rock \u2192 scissors). Following this pattern, they might play paper next.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider two main psychological factors:\n1. The opponent has lost twice, which might make them more desperate to win\n2. They might have noticed that we've been correctly predicting their moves, so they might try to break their own pattern\n\nDecision Maker: Given these factors, I believe the opponent is likely to:\na) Either complete their rotation pattern with paper\nb) Or try to completely break the pattern by going back to rock\n\nPattern Analyst: The pressure of two losses often leads players to break patterns rather than complete them. They might think we've figured out their rotation and try to surprise us.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. After two losses, players rarely continue predictable patterns. They're more likely to revert to a \"safe\" move like rock, which was their initial choice.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on this analysis, let's play paper. This will:\n- Beat the likely \"back to rock\" move\n- Show we're not just following a simple counter-pattern ourselves\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Players often feel more balanced and rational\n2. Some players see a tie as a \"mini-victory\" after losses\n3. The tie came from both choosing paper, creating a shared recent history\n\nDecision Maker: We need to consider what they think we'll do. They might reason that:\na) We might stick with paper since it just \"worked\" (got at least a tie)\nb) We might try to beat paper with scissors\nc) They might try to second-guess us and play rock to beat potential scissors\n\nPattern Analyst: The tie breaks the losing streak psychology and resets the emotional state somewhat. Players often become more strategic rather than reactive after a tie.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've now played all three moves (rock, scissors, paper) and just matched our paper, they might try to take control of the game with an aggressive move like scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with the Game Strategist.

Players in this state often make dramatic strategy changes\n\nPattern Analyst: In high-frustration states after multiple losses, players often:\n1. Revert to their very first move (rock in this case)\n2. Or try to copy their opponent's last successful move (our rock)\n\nDecision Maker: Given their likely frustration and our recent success with rock, they might think we'll use rock again. In this state of multiple losses:\n- They're likely to play paper to beat an expected rock\n- They might see paper as \"safe\" since it got them their only non-loss (the tie)\n- The psychological need to win might override any complex strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. When players are backed into a corner with multiple losses, they often go for what they perceive as their \"best\" remaining option, which would be paper in this case.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play scissors.

They've never won a single round\n2. Their last two moves (scissors, paper) both lost\n3. They might be feeling completely read/predicted\n4. This often leads to extremely emotional or completely random play\n\nPattern Analyst: In such situations with multiple consecutive losses, players often:\n1. Become completely unpredictable/random\n2.

They might feel they've found a \"safer\" move with paper (2 ties, 1 loss)\n2. The tie gives them a small psychological respite from losing\n3. However, they might realize we'll expect them to stick with paper\n\nPattern Analyst: When players find a move that gives them some success (in this case, paper producing ties):\n1. They often stick with it hoping for better results\n2. OR they immediately abandon it, fearing their opponent will counter it\n3. The fact they've used paper three times suggests some comfort with this move\n\nDecision Maker: Two key considerations:\n- The ties from paper might make them overconfident in this move\n- BUT they've also seen us play paper multiple times successfully\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern of play and psychological state, they're more likely to switch away from paper now. After two consecutive papers (one lost, one tied), they'll likely expect us to counter with scissors, which might lead them to play rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play paper again.

They've shown extreme persistence with scissors (4 consecutive times)\n2. This persistence has led to poor results (1 tie, 1 loss recently)\n3. They've reached a point where continuing with scissors would be irrational\n4. They must realize their strategy has become completely transparent\n\nPattern Analyst: After such a long streak with one move:\n1. The probability of switching is extremely high\n2. Players usually make a dramatic change after showing such predictability\n3. They might feel embarrassed about being so predictable\n4. They often switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n\nDecision Maker: From their perspective:\n- They've become extremely predictable\n- Our rock just beat them again\n- They might expect us to use rock again\n- Their most logical move would be paper to beat our expected rock\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological pressure to change strategy is at its peak. After six scissors plays, including four consecutive ones, they are almost certain to switch. Paper would be their most logical choice as it:\n- Beats our last successful move (rock)\n- Hasn't been used in several rounds\n- Previously gave them two ties (their second-best results)\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n- Counters their likely switch to paper\n- They're extremely unlikely to use scissors a seventh time\n- Even if they try rock (their opening move), we only lose one round\n- This is the perfect time to predict and counter their forced strategy switch\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've turned predictability into an advantage\n2. Our attempts to outthink them have often backfired\n3. They're winning the psychological battle through simplicity\n4. Sometimes the obvious play is the right play\n\nDecision Maker: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n- Their commitment to paper is extraordinary\n- They've shown they'll stick with paper despite counters\n- We've lost more by trying to predict switches than by playing the simple counter\n- The direct counter to paper has worked better than trying to predict their adaptation\n- If they do finally switch, we accept the loss\n- No more overthinking - stick with the proven counter\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
