    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The payoff matrix shows:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1/-1)\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1/-1)\n   - Same moves result in tie (0/0)\n\n3. Since this is the first round:\n   - I have no pattern data on the opponent\n   - All moves are equally viable\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players\n   - If they play Rock, Paper would win\n   - If they play Scissors, Rock would win\n   - Paper is vulnerable to Scissors\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Rock provides protection against Scissors\n   - Rock is a psychologically \"strong\" first move\n   - While Paper could beat Rock, Rock seems the safest initial choice\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Without historical data\n   - Wanting a balanced first move\n   - Aiming for both offensive and defensive potential\n   - Rock appears to be the most strategic first move\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as a balanced opening move, providing good defense while being a common and psychologically strong first choice.\n"

Strategic options:\n   - If opponent stays with rock: Paper wins\n   - If opponent switches to paper: Scissors wins\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: Rock wins\n\n4. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They showed conservative play by choosing rock first\n   - Conservative players often stick to what worked (partially)\n   - Or they might try to counter my previous rock\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - I predict opponent will either:\n     a) Stay with rock (conservative)\n     b) Switch to paper (to beat my previous rock)\n   - Paper would be risky as it loses to scissors\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they switch\n   - Scissors is a good aggressive counter to expected paper\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors anticipating the opponent might switch to paper to counter my previous rock move.\n"
