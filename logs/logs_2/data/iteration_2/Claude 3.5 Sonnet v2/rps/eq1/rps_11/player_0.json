    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Game Strategist - for analyzing game theory and strategic thinking\n2. Pattern Analyst - for studying opponent behavior and tendencies\n3. Psychology Expert - for understanding human decision-making\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. In such cases, game theory suggests that each option should have an equal probability of being chosen to maintain unpredictability.\n\nPsychology Expert: In the first move of rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their opening move. This is because rock is often perceived as a \"strong\" or \"stable\" choice. However, knowing this, some players might anticipate this and choose paper instead.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any historical data on the opponent, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, we should make note of whatever move is played in this round to begin building our understanding of the opponent's strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the psychology expert's insight about rock being a common first move, and players sometimes countering that with paper, I would suggest going with scissors. This could give us an advantage if they try to counter the common \"rock\" opening with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with this reasoning. Additionally, scissors is the least commonly chosen first move, which might give us an element of surprise.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's proceed with scissors and carefully observe the opponent's response to inform our future moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Using scissors as an opening move to counter potential paper plays, while being mindful that this is less commonly expected as a first move.\n"

This gives us our first data point about their playing style. They might:\n1. Stick with rock since it was successful\n2. Switch to something else expecting us to counter their previous move\n3. Be using a completely random strategy\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent won with a conventional opening move (rock). This success might boost their confidence in traditional strategies. They might expect us to play paper to counter their previous rock, and thus might switch to scissors to counter our expected paper.\n\nGame Strategist: We need to consider all layers of thinking here:\n- If they stick with rock -> paper would win\n- If they expect us to play paper and switch to scissors -> rock would win\n- If they try to be unpredictable and switch to paper -> scissors would win\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who win their first round often feel emboldened and might try to demonstrate their sophistication by changing their strategy. The most sophisticated-seeming counter to their previous rock would be paper, so they might be tempted to switch to scissors to counter that.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. It protects against the likely scissors play if they're thinking one level ahead\n2. If they stick to their winning rock move, we'll tie rather than lose\n3. Only if they switch to paper would we lose, which seems less likely given the psychological dynamics\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

If they continue this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has won twice now, which could affect their strategy in two ways:\n1. They might feel very confident and continue their successful pattern of progression\n2. They might think we've figured out their pattern and try to surprise us with something unexpected\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the layers:\n1.

If they stick with paper \u2192 scissors would win\n\nPattern Analyst: The clearest pattern we see is the clockwise progression (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 [likely scissors]).

However, they might also realize that their pattern is becoming obvious and might try to outthink us by breaking it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this analysis, I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1.

Let's review all moves:\nRound 1: Opponent: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nThis confirms they were indeed following a clockwise pattern, and we successfully predicted it. Now the question is: how will they adapt after their first loss?\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent just experienced their first loss after two wins. This is a crucial psychological moment:\n1. They might realize their pattern was too predictable\n2. They might feel the need to regain control\n3. They might second-guess their next move more than previous rounds\n\nGame Strategist: In such situations, players often:\n1. Return to their successful opening move (rock)\n2. Try to counter what just beat them (paper to beat our rock)\n3. Completely randomize to become unpredictable\n\nPsychology Expert: After being figured out with a pattern, players typically avoid being predictable in their next move. The most natural response would be to play paper to beat the rock that just defeated them.\n\nPattern Analyst: While they might try to counter our rock with paper, that would be creating a new predictable pattern. Given they've just learned about the dangers of being predictable, they might try something less obvious.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing scissors for these reasons:\n1. It beats paper, which is their most psychologically appealing move (countering our winning rock)\n2. If they try to be totally unpredictable and choose randomly, we have equal chances against any move\n3.

Counters paper if they maintain their successful last move\n2. They might feel paper is working again after breaking their losing streak\n3. They've shown they can outthink our rock plays\n4. We need to adapt our strategy now that they've broken their losing streak\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Scissors helps us counter their potential confidence with paper while adapting to their demonstrated ability to read our moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter potential paper repeat after their successful streak-breaking move) scissors\n"

The tie keeps their momentum from being completely stopped\n2. They've avoided returning to a losing position\n3. Their confidence should be stable\n4.

If they stick with scissors expecting us to switch \u2192 rock wins\n3. If they try paper thinking we'll play rock \u2192 scissors wins\n\nPattern Analyst: Earlier in the game, they showed a tendency to play rock when needing stability. However, they've just demonstrated more sophisticated play with their comeback paper and scissors tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie with scissors, many players avoid repeating it, seeing it as too obvious. Given their recent success with paper, they might return to that strategy, but they've also shown they understand the danger of being predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for these reasons:\n1. Counters scissors if they maintain their last move\n2. They might avoid paper since it's their most recent winning move\n3. They've shown renewed strategic thinking, making a simple scissors repeat unlikely\n4. Even if they outthink us with paper, we're still ahead in points\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

Paper would be the most natural progression from rock, but they know we might expect this. They've shown they can think beyond obvious moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors for these reasons:\n1. Counters paper if they try to beat our potential rock\n2.
