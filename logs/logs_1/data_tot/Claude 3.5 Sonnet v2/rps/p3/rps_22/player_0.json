    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward scenarios\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. In such cases, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper is a high-risk, high-reward move. If we're right, we get 3 points, but if we're wrong, we lose 3 points. Rock and scissors have a more balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Psychology Expert. Many new players statistically favor rock as their first move. If we play paper, we have a good chance of winning 3 points, with the worst case being losing 1 point if they play scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological advantage of playing paper is significant here. Even if we're wrong, the loss is manageable, and the potential gain is substantial.\n\nRisk Analyst: The expected value seems to favor paper in this opening move, given the likelihood of opponents playing rock first.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, statistics suggest that rock is a common opening move. Paper gives us the highest potential reward if we're correct, while maintaining a manageable risk.\n"

Now, we need to consider that the opponent has lost 3 points and might change their strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a significant loss, players often change their behavior in predictable ways. Many players will either:\n1. Switch to what beat them (paper in this case)\n2. Try to counter what beat them by playing scissors\nThe likelihood of them playing rock again is lower after just losing with it.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our success with paper, the opponent is likely to expect us to use it again. This makes paper a more dangerous play this round. They're more likely to play scissors to counter our previous winning move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent will likely try to counter our paper play. Playing rock would protect us against their probable scissors play, and would only risk losing 3 points if they stick with paper (which is psychologically unlikely after just losing to it).\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure is on the opponent after losing 3 points. They're more likely to make an aggressive move to try to recover their loss, which supports the scissors prediction.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock appears to be our safest play with the highest expected value. It beats the predicted scissors move for a 1 point gain, and even if we're wrong, the opponent is unlikely to repeat their losing rock move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After winning with paper, our opponent is likely to counter with scissors, making rock our optimal play.

The opponent has lost 4 points total and will be feeling significant pressure to win.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a crucial psychological moment. After two consecutive losses, players often:\n1. Become more predictable due to frustration\n2. Try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by thinking multiple levels ahead\n3. Sometimes revert to their original strategy out of desperation\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their pattern so far:\nRound 1: They played rock (lost to our paper)\nRound 2: They played scissors (lost to our rock)\nThey've shown a tendency to change their move each time, possibly trying to adapt.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their pattern of rock\u2192scissors, there's a strong chance they'll complete the cycle with paper.

The risk-reward ratio is favorable:\n- If we're right (they play paper): we win 1 point\n- If they play rock: we lose 1 point\n- If they play scissors: it's a tie\nThis is a relatively safe play with positive expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After their pattern of rock\u2192scissors, and considering the psychological pressure of two consecutive losses, our opponent is likely to play paper to try to counter our previous rock move and potentially score a high reward.

Our total score is still positive (+3 from first round, +1 from second round, -1 from third round = +3 total).\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has finally won a round, which changes the psychological dynamics. After their first success with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked (a common human tendency to repeat successful actions)\n2. Feel more confident and try to anticipate our adjustment to their winning move\n3.

Even if they try to anticipate this and play scissors, we'd only lose 1 point, compared to the potential 3-point gain.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Their return to rock and subsequent success might create a psychological anchor. Players often develop a \"favorite\" move, and rock appears to be theirs. The fact that it just worked for them reinforces this tendency.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider the payoffs:\n- If we play paper and they play rock (likely): +3 points\n- If we play paper and they play scissors (counter-strategy): -1 point\n- If we play paper and they play paper: 0 points\nThe expected value favors paper given their rock preference and recent success with it.\n\nGame Strategist: We should also note that they might be identifying our strategy of trying to counter their moves.

There's a tendency to try to \"win\" the tie by changing moves\n3. Some players might stick with the same move, thinking their opponent will surely change\n4.

Here's why:\n1. It has the most balanced risk/reward profile\n2. It breaks from our last move (paper)\n3. It protects against an opponent trying to maximize points with paper\n4. If we lose, we only lose 1 point\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The balanced risk profile of scissors might appeal to both players in this high-pressure situation, but that's exactly why we should avoid it. In this case, rock might be the unexpected move as it breaks both the recent paper play and the obvious scissors counter.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock does offer some advantages:\n- Beats the \"safe\" scissors play\n- Only vulnerable to paper\n- Could catch opponent trying to be too clever\n- Breaks the recent pattern decisively\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After four consecutive ties, we need to break from predictable patterns.

Play rock as a safe move against potential scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing a significant tie streak, players often become more aggressive in trying to recover momentum. Paper would be their most aggressive play, as it:\n1. Counters our winning rock move\n2. Offers the highest potential points (+3)\n3.

The combination of:\n- Breaking a long tie streak\n- Losing to rock again\n- Needing points\n- Psychological pressure to counter our success\nMakes paper their most likely play.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect paper, scissors is our optimal move:\n- If they play paper (our prediction): +1 point\n- If they play rock: -1 point\n- If they play scissors: 0 points\nThis gives us a balanced risk profile with positive expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After breaking the long tie sequence with our winning rock play, our opponent is likely to counter with paper.

They might view rock as their \"lucky\" move\n\nGame Strategist: Their rock usage pattern is telling:\n- They started with rock\n- Used rock to get their first win\n- Returned to rock after the tie sequence\n- Just won with rock again\nThis suggests a strong psychological attachment to rock as their \"winning\" move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze potential moves:\nPaper:\n- Beats their favored rock move (+3)\n- Vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n- High reward potential\nRock:\n- Ties with their likely rock (0)\n- Loses to paper (-3)\n- Safe against scissors\nScissors:\n- Loses to their likely rock (-1)\n- Beats paper (+1)\n- Just lost with this move\n\nPsychology Expert: After winning with rock, they're highly likely to stick with it. Players tend to repeat successful moves, especially when that move has brought them multiple victories. The psychological comfort with rock seems deeply ingrained in their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their consistent return to rock, especially in crucial moments, and their recent success with it, paper would be our optimal play.

They're showing renewed strategic depth after their breakthrough win.\n\nRisk Analyst: Updated history focus on recent critical turns:\nRound 15: Rock (lost to paper)\nRound 16: Paper (won vs rock, +3)\nRound 17: Rock (won vs scissors, +1)\n\nThey've won two consecutive rounds with different moves, showing strategic adaptability.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological dynamics have shifted dramatically:\n1. They've gone from 5 losses to 2 consecutive wins\n2. Their confidence is likely very high\n3. They've shown they can predict and counter our moves\n4. They might feel they've gained control of the game\n5. Success with different moves (paper, then rock) shows strategic flexibility\n\nGame Strategist: Their sequence is telling:\n1. Won big with paper (+3)\n2. Instead of repeating paper, they successfully predicted our scissors counter\n3. They're showing higher-level strategic thinking\n4. They're no longer playing predictably\n\nRisk Analyst: For their next move, they might:\n1. Return to paper (their first breakthrough move)\n2. Stick with rock (their recent success)\n3. Complete the cycle with scissors\n4. Try to stay one step ahead of our prediction\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations where players have regained momentum with consecutive wins:\n1. They tend to become more confident in their reads\n2. May try to demonstrate superior strategy\n3. Often attempt to stay unpredictable\n4. Might try to establish dominance with aggressive plays\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to think ahead and their current confidence, they're likely to expect us to play rock to counter their recent rock success. This would lead them to play paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the moves:\nPaper:\n- Counters our expected rock\n- High reward potential\n- Shows strategic dominance\nRock:\n- Just succeeded with it\n- More predictable now\nScissors:\n- Unexpected option\n- Could counter our paper counter\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that paper is their most likely play. They've shown higher-level thinking, and paper would:\n1. Counter our likely rock response\n2. Maintain their momentum\n3. Offer maximum points\n4. Show strategic superiority\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect paper, scissors would be our optimal play:\n- If they play paper (our prediction): +1 point\n- If they play rock: -1 point\n- If they play scissors: 0 points\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors With their renewed confidence and demonstrated strategic depth, our opponent is likely to expect us to play rock to counter their recent rock success. This makes paper their optimal play, which we can counter with scissors. This gives us the best chance to break their winning streak while maintaining reasonable risk.\n"

Our score remains at +7.\n\nRisk Analyst: Recent critical sequence:\nRound 15: Rock (lost to paper)\nRound 16: Paper (won vs rock, +3)\nRound 17: Rock (won vs scissors, +1)\nRound 18: Scissors (tied)\n\nPsychology Expert: The current psychological situation is complex:\n1. They've maintained their momentum by avoiding a loss\n2. The tie breaks their winning streak but not negatively\n3. Their confidence likely remains high\n4. They've shown ability to play at multiple strategic levels\n5. The scissors tie suggests similar strategic thinking patterns\n\nGame Strategist: After a scissors tie, players often:\n1. Play rock to beat potential repeated scissors\n2. Play paper to counter the expected rock response\n3. Stick with scissors expecting overthinking\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their recent pattern:\n- Used paper for breakthrough win\n- Adapted to rock to counter our scissors\n- Matched our scissors in tie\nThey're showing strong adaptive strategy rather than fixed patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their demonstrated strategic depth, they're likely to:\n1. Recognize we might expect rock after scissors\n2. Consider that we might counter that with paper\n3. Try to stay one step ahead of our thinking\n4. Make a move that shows strategic dominance\n\nGame Strategist: Their recent plays show they're capable of:\n1. Reading our strategy\n2. Making unexpected adaptations\n3. Thinking multiple moves ahead\n4. Breaking from obvious patterns\n\nRisk Analyst: In this situation:\nRock:\n- Obvious counter to scissors tie\n- Too predictable given their level\nPaper:\n- Counters expected rock\n- Shows strategic depth\nScissors:\n- Unexpected repeat\n- Could catch overthinking\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated ability to think ahead, they're likely to play paper because:\n1. It counters the obvious rock response to scissors\n2. It maintains their strategic advantage\n3. It shows they can read multiple levels of strategy\n4. It offers highest potential reward\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect paper, scissors would be our optimal play:\n- If they play paper (our prediction): +1 point\n- If they play rock: -1 point\n- If they play scissors: 0 points\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors After the scissors tie and given their demonstrated strategic depth, our opponent is likely to play paper to counter the obvious rock response to scissors. This shows they're thinking multiple moves ahead. Scissors gives us the best opportunity to counter their likely paper play while maintaining a balanced risk profile.\n"

They've lost after showing strong strategic ability\n2. Their higher-level strategy (paper) was predicted and countered\n3. They might feel their strategic depth was insufficient\n4. Could either double down on complex strategy or simplify\n5. Might question their recent strategic success\n\nGame Strategist: Their recent sequence shows:\n1. Initial success with complex strategies\n2. Ability to adapt and think ahead\n3. But ultimately got predicted and countered\n4. Might feel their strategy became too predictable\n\nRisk Analyst: After being countered at a higher strategic level, players typically:\n1. Simplify their strategy\n2. Make an unexpected move\n3. Try to break pattern recognition\n4. Sometimes revert to basics\n\nPsychology Expert: When players get caught trying to be clever, they often:\n1. Feel exposed in their strategic thinking\n2. Try to be unpredictable\n3. Sometimes revert to fundamental moves\n4. Might make an aggressive play to regain control\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, rock emerges as their likely play because:\n1. It's their historical comfort move\n2. Beats our winning scissors play\n3. Represents a return to basics after complex strategy failed\n4. Safer than continuing with predictable higher-level plays\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their options:\nRock:\n- Beats our winning scissors\n- Returns to comfort zone\n- Historically successful for them\nPaper:\n- Just lost with it\n- Feels predictable now\nScissors:\n- Matches our last winning move\n- Could catch paper counter\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the rock prediction. After being outmaneuvered at a higher strategic level, players often return to their fundamental strategies, especially ones that directly counter what just beat them.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we expect rock, paper would be our optimal play:\n- If they play rock (our prediction): +3 points\n- If they play scissors: -1 point\n- If they play paper: 0 points\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After being outmaneuvered in their attempt at higher-level strategy, our opponent is likely to return to rock - their historical comfort move that also counters our winning scissors play. This represents a psychological return to basics after complex strategy failed. Paper gives us the best opportunity to capitalize on this likely strategic simplification.\n"
