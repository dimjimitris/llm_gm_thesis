Pattern analysis after rock ties:\n   * Previously, rock ties were often followed by paper plays\n   * However, this has become predictable\n   * Last time after rock tie (Round 10), I played scissors and won\n   * That strategy worked because opponent played paper\n\n3. Opponent's behavior:\n   * They've shown ability to predict obvious moves\n   * They've matched my rock plays multiple times\n   * They tend to shift strategy after ties\n   * They've often used paper effectively after rock situations\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   * Both players showing caution with rock\n   * Opponent might expect me to break tie with paper\n   * They might try to counter expected paper with scissors\n   * Or they might stick with rock, expecting me to overthink\n\n5. Risk evaluation:\n   * Paper: High risk (-1 vs scissors) but high reward (+3 vs rock)\n   * Rock: Safe but likely another tie\n   * Scissors: Good against paper but risky against rock (-1)\n\n6. Decision making:\n   * Need to break tie pattern\n   * Opponent likely expects paper from me\n   * Playing scissors would be too risky\n   * Rock has become too predictable\n   * Despite risks, paper offers best potential reward\n   * Most opponents eventually break from rock after ties\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern analysis:\n   * Opponent has successfully used rock against my scissors twice\n   * They're showing strong ability to predict my counter-moves\n   * I'm becoming too predictable in trying to counter their expected moves\n   * They're thinking one step ahead of my predictions\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Opponent just won with rock\n   * They might feel confident to stick with rock\n   * Or they might expect me to play paper to counter rock\n   * They've shown ability to outthink my strategic shifts\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * If they stick with rock (likely), paper wins (+3)\n   * If they expect paper and play scissors, I lose (-1)\n   * If they play paper expecting my scissors, I lose (-3)\n   * Need to break cycle of failed predictions\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   * My attempts to predict their counter-moves have failed\n   * They're successfully baiting my moves\n   * Need to simplify strategy\n   * Sometimes direct approach is best\n\n6. Decision making:\n   * Given opponent's successful mind games\n   * Need to stop over-thinking their strategy\n   * They've won twice with rock\n   * Most players stick with winning moves\n   * Simple paper counter to rock is logical choice\n   * Worth risk for higher reward potential\n\n[move] paper\n",
