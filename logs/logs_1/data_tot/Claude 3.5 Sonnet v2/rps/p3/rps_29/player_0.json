    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential gains and losses\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their behavior. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only offer 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Against a fresh player, many tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. This is a common psychological pattern in first-time encounters.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, paper would be optimal against a likely rock play. Even if we're wrong:\n- vs rock: +3 points\n- vs paper: 0 points\n- vs scissors: -1 points\nThe expected value is positive if rock is indeed the most likely first move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with this analysis. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation, considering both the game theory and psychological aspects.\n\n[move] paper (Playing paper as it offers the highest potential reward and is effective against the common first-move choice of rock)\n"

After losing to paper, many players tend to shift to scissors as a counter-strategy, thinking we might use paper again. This is a common reactive behavior pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent lost heavily (-3 points) to paper. Game theory suggests they're likely to adapt their strategy to counter our previous successful move. The obvious counter to paper is scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze potential scenarios if we play rock:\n- vs scissors (likely counter move): +1 point\n- vs rock: 0 points\n- vs paper: -3 points\nGiven that scissors is the most probable response based on both psychological and strategic analysis, rock seems to be the safest play with the best potential outcome.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychological tendency to counter the previous losing move is strong, especially after a significant point loss.\n\nGame Strategist: Rock also protects us from the maximum possible loss (-3 points) that we would face if we played paper again and they used scissors.\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating opponent will switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play)\n"

Instead of switching to scissors to counter our paper, they used paper to counter our anticipated rock.

The opponent has shown sophisticated thinking by not following the obvious counter-strategy. They've demonstrated they can anticipate and counter our predictions. After successfully using paper twice, they might:\n1. Stay with paper due to its success\n2. Switch to something else expecting us to counter paper\n3.

Round 2: We lost with rock vs paper (-3)\n3. Round 3: Tie with scissors vs scissors (0)\nOur opponent seems to be using sophisticated strategy rather than simple patterns.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie with scissors, players often feel a need to \"break\" the stalemate. The most aggressive break would be paper (highest points), but that's risky. Our opponent has shown they're capable of thinking strategically, having used paper effectively twice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the current situation:\n- After a scissors tie, the opponent might:\n1. Stick with scissors expecting us to switch\n2. Switch to rock to beat scissors\n3. Switch to paper for maximum gain\nLooking at our previous interactions, they've shown a preference for paper plays and higher-risk, higher-reward moves.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated comfort with paper plays and strategic thinking, rock offers a good balance:\n- Beats their potential scissors (if they stay)\n- Ties with their potential rock (if they try to counter scissors)\n- Only loses to paper, which would be their most aggressive play\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur.

If they expect us to play scissors (based on our previous success), they might play rock to counter\n2. If they expect us to play paper (obvious counter to rock tie), they might play scissors\n3.

Expect us to switch from paper, anticipating their scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and our history:\n- They've consistently countered successful moves\n- They've shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n- After losing to paper, scissors is their most logical counter\n\nGame Strategist: Rock would be our optimal play here because:\n1. Counters their likely scissors play (+1)\n2. Protects against maximum loss (-3 from paper)\n3. They've rarely used the same move after losing with it\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. The opponent has consistently shown they adapt after losses, and scissors would be their most logical adaptation to counter our paper victory.\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating a scissors counter to our paper victory while maintaining defensive position)\n"

They're extremely confident in their paper strategy\n2. They're setting up for a major strategy shift\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their consistent success with paper:\n- They might continue with paper, believing in their winning strategy\n- They might expect us to use scissors to counter their paper success\n- They might switch to rock to protect against our potential scissors play\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, scissors offers our best balance:\n1. Counters their successful paper strategy (+1)\n2. Minimizes potential loss against rock (-1)\n3. They've shown a strong preference for paper plays\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has been remarkably successful with paper, but they must know we're likely to counter it now.
