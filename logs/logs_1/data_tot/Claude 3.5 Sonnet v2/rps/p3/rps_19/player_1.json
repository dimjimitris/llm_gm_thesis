    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and detecting patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's collaborate!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their tendencies. Let's analyze the payoff structure: Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points). Rock and scissors have lower risk-reward profiles (\u00b11 point).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that this is our first move and we lack information about the opponent, we should consider a balanced approach. While paper could give us the highest reward, it also carries the highest risk. Rock is a common first move, which makes paper tempting, but that might be too predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest going with scissors. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays rock (common first move), we lose only 1 point\n2. If opponent plays paper (trying to counter expected rock), we win 1 point\n3. If opponent plays scissors, it's a tie with no loss\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Scissors offers a balanced risk-reward profile for the first move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

However, we need to be careful about assuming patterns too early. The opponent might:\n1. Switch to rock to counter our scissors\n2. Stick with paper hoping we won't repeat scissors\n3. Play scissors themselves expecting us to play paper\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent just lost to scissors, so they might be psychologically primed to counter scissors with rock. This is a common reactive strategy in RPS. However, if they're more sophisticated, they might expect us to switch to paper to counter their expected rock.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider the payoffs:\n- If we play rock: Win 1 vs scissors, Lose 3 vs paper, Tie vs rock\n- If we play paper: Win 3 vs rock, Lose 1 vs scissors, Tie vs paper\n- If we play scissors: Win 1 vs paper, Lose 1 vs rock, Tie vs scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they just lost to scissors, rock is likely their next move. I suggest we play paper - it has the highest potential payoff against their likely move.\n\nRisk Manager: While paper has higher risk, I agree with the Game Strategist. The psychological tendency to counter the previous losing move is strong, making rock a likely choice from our opponent.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The opponent's likely adjustment to their loss against scissors makes paper our optimal play here.\n\n[move] paper\n"

A more aggressive strategy\n2. A return to basics\n3. An attempt to predict our next move based on our winning pattern\n\nRisk Manager: Our opponent has lost to both scissors and paper. They might expect us to continue our winning streak with another aggressive play. However, they've just lost heavily (-3) to paper, which creates a strong psychological incentive to play scissors this time.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they've lost twice and just suffered a -3 loss, they're very likely to play scissors to counter our paper. We should counter that with rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The progression of their moves (paper \u2192 rock) and the magnitude of their last loss strongly suggests scissors as their next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock is a good choice here:\n- If they play scissors (most likely), we win 1\n- If they play paper (less likely), we lose 3\n- If they play rock, we tie\nThe psychological factors strongly favor them playing scissors, making rock our best option.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 3: We played rock, they played paper (we lost -3)\nThey might have started recognizing our pattern of trying to predict their moves.\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent just made a clever play. Instead of playing scissors as we expected, they played paper, suggesting they're becoming more sophisticated in their strategy. They've now used paper twice (rounds 1 and 3), winning their latest round.\n\nRisk Manager: We're now at net +1 points total (+1, +3, -3). We need to be more careful as our opponent seems to be improving their strategic thinking. They've shown they can break from expected reactive patterns.\n\nGame Strategist: Since they just won with paper, they might:\n1. Stick with paper hoping for continued success\n2. Expect us to play scissors to counter their paper\n3. Switch to rock to counter our expected scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown adaptability. They've used paper twice successfully (their last win and their first move). This might indicate a preference for paper plays.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their demonstrated sophistication, we should expect them to anticipate our scissors play (as it would counter their successful paper). Therefore, they might play rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper. Here's why:\n- If they play rock (to counter our expected scissors), we win +3\n- If they stick with paper, we tie (safe outcome)\n- If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point\n\nAll personas agree this is a balanced choice given the opponent's demonstrated ability to think ahead.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 4: paper vs rock (won +3)\nInteresting - they've played rock twice now, both times losing to our paper.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has fallen victim to our paper play twice now, losing -3 points each time. This creates a very strong psychological pressure to counter paper with scissors this round. Their total score is quite negative (-6), which might make them more desperate for a win.\n\nRisk Manager: Our current total is +4 points (+1, +3, -3, +3). We're in a good position, but need to protect our lead. Let's consider the opponent's likely mindset:\n- They've lost heavily to paper twice\n- They might be frustrated and seeking to counter our successful paper plays\n- They've never played scissors yet in any round\n\nPattern Analyzer: The fact that they've never used scissors in any round is significant. Combined with their recent losses to paper, this makes scissors an extremely likely play from them now.\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly recommend rock for this round:\n1. It directly counters their likely scissors play\n2. If they play rock, we tie (acceptable given our lead)\n3. Only paper would beat us, but they're psychologically unlikely to play paper after losing to it twice\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

The opponent has lost five times and might be:\n1. Tilting (making emotional decisions)\n2. Trying to find a pattern in our plays\n3. Going back to basics to reset their strategy\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing with scissors, many players revert to rock as it feels \"safe\" and \"strong.\" This is especially true when they're on a losing streak and feeling defensive.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their likely psychological state and the tendency to revert to rock after losing with scissors, I suggest we play paper again. It's been our most successful move (+3 points twice).\n\nRisk Manager: While paper carries the highest risk (-3 if they play scissors), I agree with the assessment.

It beats scissors if they stick with their winning move\n2. It ties with rock if they follow their cycle\n3. Only loses 3 points to paper, which they're less likely to play after just winning with scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"
