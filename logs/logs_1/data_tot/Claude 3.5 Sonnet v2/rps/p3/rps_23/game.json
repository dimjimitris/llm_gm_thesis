Opponent's psychological state:\n   - They've lost 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Their last two moves were paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've lost heavily (-6 points) from paper vs rock losses\n   - They must be extremely frustrated\n   - They're likely feeling very predictable\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves without strategy\n   - Their moves appear increasingly desperate\n   - They've used rock twice and lost badly both times\n   - They might abandon rock completely after two costly losses\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - They're likely to avoid rock due to recent heavy losses\n   - They might expect me to play paper again\n   - In extreme frustration, players often choose scissors\n   - Scissors is an aggressive move that might appeal to them now\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their likely extreme frustration\n   - Their probable avoidance of rock\n   - Their likely desire to counter my paper plays\n   - Rock would be the safest choice to:\n   * Beat their probable scissors play\n   * Protect against their aggressive tendency\n   * Break my own paper pattern\n\n[move] rock\n"
