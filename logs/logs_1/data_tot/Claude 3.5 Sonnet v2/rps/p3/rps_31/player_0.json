    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential payoffs and losses\n\nStarting collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have prior history to analyze. Let's look at the payoff matrix:\n- Paper vs Rock: Best reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Moderate reward (+1)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Moderate reward (+1)\n- Same moves: No points (0)\n- Losing: Corresponding negative points\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a new player, they might default to the most common opening move which is often 'rock'. Studies show rock is chosen approximately 35% of the time in opening moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure, playing paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors). Rock has moderate reward potential (+1) but highest risk (-3 if opponent plays paper).\n\nGame Strategist: Considering all factors, paper seems optimal here - it gives us the highest potential payoff (+3), beats the statistically most common opening move (rock), and has manageable downside (-1).\n\nAll personas agree on playing paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives us our first piece of information about their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting what they think the opponent will do next. Since we both played paper, they might:\n1. Stick with paper expecting us to switch\n2. Switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again\n3. Switch to rock as a completely different option\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- If they expect us to play paper again, they'll likely choose scissors\n- If they try to be unpredictable, they might switch to rock\n- Least likely scenario is them playing paper again after a tie\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, rock would be a strong play because:\n1. It beats scissors (which they might play expecting us to use paper again)\n2. Only loses to paper (which they're less likely to play twice)\n3. Has a moderate reward (+1) if we're right\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. People rarely play the same move twice after a tie, as they expect their opponent to predict that move.\n\nAll personas agree on playing rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
