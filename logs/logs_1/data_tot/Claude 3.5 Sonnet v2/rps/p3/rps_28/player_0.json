    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - Skilled at identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Specializes in evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. Let's analyze the payoff matrix: paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points), while rock and scissors have more balanced outcomes (\u00b11 point).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Without any historical data, we can't predict the opponent's tendencies. However, in many cases, players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff asymmetry, I suggest we consider paper. While it carries more risk (-3 points if we lose), it also has the highest reward potential (3 points if we win). Against a likely rock opening, this would be optimal.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. The expected value of playing paper is higher if we assume a slightly higher probability of the opponent playing rock. Even if they play scissors, our loss (-1) would be less than the potential gain (3) from correctly predicting rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Concurring with the strategy. Paper provides the best risk-adjusted return in this opening scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on risk-reward analysis and common opening moves by players.\n"

They're an aggressive player who likes to go for quick wins\n2. They anticipated our paper opening\n3. It could have been a random choice\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they used scissors last time, we need to consider their likely next move. Players often either:\n- Stick with a winning move\n- Switch to counter what they think we'll play\n- Play rock as a safe move after a win\n\nRisk Manager: The previous round cost us -1 points. We need to be strategic but not overly cautious. If they stick with scissors, rock would give us a +1 point. If they anticipate us playing rock and switch to paper, we'd lose 3 points. If they play rock expecting us to play scissors, we'd lose 1 point.\n\nPattern Analyzer: In rock-paper-scissors, players often don't repeat the same move after a win, as they expect their opponent to counter their previous move.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors if they repeat their move\n2. It's a safe tie if they also switch to rock\n3. The maximum loss (-3 against paper) is acceptable given the game situation\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

However, after losing with scissors, they are highly likely to change their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the sequence:\nRound 1: They played scissors (won)\nRound 2: They played scissors (lost)\nAfter two consecutive scissors plays and a recent loss, they're likely to change their move.\n\nRisk Manager: Our current score is 0 points (-1 from first round, +1 from second round). We need to think about what a player would do after losing with the same move twice:\n1. They might switch to rock as a \"strong\" move\n2. They might try paper to break their scissors pattern\n3. They're less likely to use scissors a third time after just losing with it\n\nPattern Analyzer: Most players have a psychological aversion to playing the same move three times in a row, especially after losing. Given their recent loss with scissors, they're most likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe they're most likely to switch to rock (which is common after losing), paper would be our optimal play. It would:\n- Beat rock (most likely scenario) for +3 points\n- Lose to scissors (unlikely scenario) for -1 points\n- Tie with paper for 0 points\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with playing paper.

They become more aggressive, trying to recoup their losses quickly\n2. They become more conservative, trying to avoid another big loss\n\nRisk Manager: Our current score is +3 points (-1, +1, +3). We're in a good position, but need to protect our lead. After losing to paper, many players will try to counter with scissors, expecting their opponent to play paper again.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that they've now tried scissors twice and rock once (all resulting in losses), they're most likely to:\n1. Try scissors to counter our successful paper play\n2. Try paper as it's the only move they haven't used yet\n3.

We're in an excellent position. The opponent is likely feeling frustrated after four rounds, with three consecutive losses. This is often when players make dramatic strategy changes.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their history and current psychological state:\n1. They're overdue to try paper, the only move they haven't used\n2. They might be tilting (making emotional decisions) after multiple losses\n3.

The tie might have relieved some pressure as it broke their losing streak. This could affect their decision-making.\n\nPattern Analyzer: There are two strong possibilities:\n1. The tie reinforces their scissors fixation, making them stick with it\n2.

Beats paper if they finally break pattern (as they should)\n2. Only loses 1 point to rock if they try that\n3. Ties if they incredibly stick with scissors again\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. The psychological pressure of repeated losses to rock must be building. Paper is their most logical alternative given:\n- It's their only winning move in the game\n- They've now lost multiple times to rock\n- Scissors has repeatedly failed them\n\nPattern Analyzer: The sheer number of scissors losses, especially to rock, makes this a likely breaking point in their strategy.
