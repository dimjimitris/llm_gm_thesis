    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Observes and analyzes patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Psychological Expert - Understands human behavior and decision-making\n4. Risk Assessor - Evaluates risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their playing style. In such cases, game theory suggests that each move should have an equal probability of being chosen to avoid being predictable.\n\nPsychological Expert: People often choose 'rock' as their first move because it's perceived as strong and stable. However, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this tendency since it's not guaranteed.\n\nPattern Analyst: We have no pattern to analyze yet since this is the first move. We should focus on making a balanced choice that gives us good chances against common first-move strategies.\n\nRisk Assessor: Given that each move has one winning scenario and one losing scenario, the risk is evenly distributed. Paper might be slightly advantageous since it counters the psychologically common 'rock' first move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with using paper. It beats the common first-move rock, and even if we lose to scissors, we'll gain valuable information about the opponent's playing style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

A strategic player who anticipated the common 'paper' counter to 'rock'\n2. A player who simply prefers scissors as an opening move\n3. Pure luck\n\nGame Strategist: Given they used scissors last round, they might:\n- Stick with a winning move\n- Change to avoid being predictable\n- Expect us to play rock (to counter their previous scissors) and thus play paper\n\nPsychological Expert: Players often feel confident after a win and might either:\n- Stick with their winning move due to increased confidence\n- Switch moves because they think we'll adapt to counter their previous move\n\nRisk Assessor: Rock would be a strong counter if they repeat scissors, and would only lose to paper. Given what we know, rock offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with rock. It protects against a scissors repeat, and even if they switch to paper, we've gained valuable information about their strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Rock also helps us establish if they have any patterns in their play - do they repeat moves after wins, or do they rotate through options?\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

This suggests either:\n1. They have a strong preference for scissors\n2. They're stubborn in their move choice\n3. They might be trying to establish a pattern to break later\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has lost their last move, which often triggers a change in strategy. They might:\n- Finally switch away from scissors after two losses\n- Expect us to continue with rock (since it won) and play paper\n- Use scissors again hoping we overthink their strategy\n\nPsychological Expert: After losing, players often change their strategy. Given that they've used scissors twice, they're likely aware that continuing with scissors would be predictable. They might expect us to use rock again and counter with paper.\n\nRisk Assessor: The opponent has shown a pattern of scissors, but continuing to play rock is risky as they're likely to adapt. If they switch to paper, we'll lose. If they stick to scissors, we win. If they choose rock, we tie.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest scissors here. Here's why:\n1. It beats paper (which they might play to counter our expected rock)\n2. It ties with scissors (if they're extremely persistent)\n3. Only loses to rock (which would be a somewhat predictable choice from us)\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

However, they might also:\n- Return to scissors after two losses\n- Stick with paper thinking we won't expect it twice\n- Try to break any pattern we might have detected\n\nPsychological Expert: After two consecutive losses, players typically:\n1.

They could be waiting for us to establish a pattern\n\nRisk Assessor: Looking at options:\n- Scissors would win if they stick with paper\n- Rock would be safe against a return to scissors\n- Paper would result in another tie if they continue mirroring\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors because:\n1. Breaks the mirroring pattern aggressively\n2. Beats paper if they continue their current move\n3. Forces them to adapt rather than mirror\n4. Even if they predict this and use rock, we learn about their adaptation speed\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Scissors is our best option. The mirroring pattern needs to be broken, and scissors is the most proactive choice. They've shown they can adapt, but they've also shown a tendency to stick with moves that work (like their earlier scissors preference).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
