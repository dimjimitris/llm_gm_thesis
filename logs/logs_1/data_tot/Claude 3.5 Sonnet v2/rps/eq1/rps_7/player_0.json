You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Play paper expecting me to switch to rock to counter their expected scissors\n3. Try rock again hoping I'll overthink and switch away from my winning paper move\n\nAlso noteworthy is that they've been quite consistent in using rock after scissors ties (as seen in rounds 13 and 16).\n\n[move] rock Since they're likely to counter my winning paper move with scissors, I'll choose rock to stay ahead of their likely adjustment.\n"

After winning with paper, they typically:\n1. Either stick with paper expecting me to avoid scissors (since scissors has often been countered successfully by them)\n2. Or switch to rock anticipating I might try scissors to counter their paper\n\nLooking at the broader pattern, when they win with paper against my rock, they tend to be cautious about potential scissors counters.\n\n[move] scissors Despite my historical losses with scissors, I'll use it here because they've shown a strong tendency to stick with paper after winning with it, and they might be overconfident after their recent paper success.\n"
