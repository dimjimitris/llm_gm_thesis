After winning with paper, they typically:\n1. Either stick with paper expecting me to avoid scissors (since scissors has often been countered successfully by them)\n2. Or switch to rock anticipating I might try scissors to counter their paper\n\nLooking at the broader pattern, when they win with paper against my rock, they tend to be cautious about potential scissors counters.\n\n[move] scissors Despite my historical losses with scissors, I'll use it here because they've shown a strong tendency to stick with paper after winning with it, and they might be overconfident after their recent paper success.\n"

After previous scissors ties:\n- After round 12 tie, they played rock in round 13\n- After round 15 tie, they played rock in round 16\n\nThis creates a strong pattern: they tend to play rock after scissors ties. They might:\n1. Follow their established pattern and play rock again\n2. Expect me to anticipate their rock pattern and try to break it\n3. Stick with scissors expecting another tie\n\n[move] paper Given their strong historical pattern of playing rock after scissors ties, I'll choose paper to counter that likely move.\n"

However, they've now lost to paper and will likely adjust. After losing to paper, they typically:\n1. Switch to scissors to counter the winning paper move\n2. Try paper themselves expecting me to switch to rock to counter their expected scissors\n3. Sometimes stick with rock hoping I'll overthink and switch away\n\nAdditionally, they've shown good ability to counter my scissors plays throughout the game, suggesting they're comfortable using rock as a defensive move.\n\n[move] rock Since they're likely to counter my winning paper move with scissors, I'll choose rock to stay ahead of their adjustment.\n"

Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n\nWe've had quite a few ties with paper moves. After these paper ties, the opponent tends to make unpredictable moves. However, they've shown a strong tendency to counter scissors with rock successfully. They might expect me to go scissors after paper (following the natural progression), but given their success against scissors, they might play rock anticipating this.\n\n[move] paper Instead of falling into the scissors trap, I'll stick with paper, anticipating they might go for rock to counter an expected scissors play from me.\n",

This continues to confirm their pattern of playing rock after scissors ties. However, after my paper wins:\n- They have often countered aggressively with scissors to punish paper repetition\n- Or they've played paper expecting me to switch to rock\n\nAnother interesting pattern is that they've consistently avoided being predictable after losses, often making strong counter-moves.\n\n[move] rock Since they're likely to counter my winning paper move with scissors (to break their own predictable pattern after scissors ties), I'll choose rock to stay ahead.\n",
        "Let's analyze recent patterns:\n- Round 16: My paper vs their rock (I won)\n- Round 17: My rock vs their paper (I lost)\n- Round 18: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 19: My paper vs their rock (I won)\n\nA clear pattern has emerged: after scissors ties, they play rock, and I've successfully countered with paper twice now (rounds 16 and 19). However, after I win with paper:\n1. They've often countered successfully with scissors to beat my paper\n2. Or they've played paper expecting me to switch to rock\n3. They might also be frustrated with this pattern and try rock again\n\nGiven that they've now lost twice to my paper in similar situations, they're likely to strongly counter it this time.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating they'll try to break their losing pattern with scissors to counter my winning paper move, I'll choose rock.\n",
