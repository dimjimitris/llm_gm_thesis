Significant changes:\n   - They finally used paper in the last round\n   - They broke their rock/scissors alternating pattern\n   - This shows they're capable of adapting\n   - First tie game of the match\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - They've demonstrated ability to break patterns\n   - They might feel validated by finally using paper\n   - After a tie, players often try to assert dominance\n   - They might return to their more comfortable moves\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper\n   - They could return to their preferred rock/scissors pattern\n   - The game is at a pivotal moment after the tie\n   - Their confidence might be up after breaking their pattern\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given they just tried paper for the first time\n   - Considering their previous comfort with rock/scissors\n   - They're likely to return to their comfort zone\n   - Rock would be safe against their probable return to scissors\n   - Rock also protects against a potential rock play from them\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notable trends:\n   - Three consecutive ties\n   - Game has become highly synchronized\n   - We're both making the same moves\n   - Match is becoming very defensive\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Three ties create strong pressure to break the pattern\n   - Both players likely frustrated with stalemate\n   - They might be trying to predict my next move\n   - The urge to break the tie streak is very strong\n\n4.

Decision:\n   - Given the three consecutive ties\n   - Considering the strong pressure to break the pattern\n   - They likely expect me to counter their predicted rock with paper\n   - Therefore, they might skip rock and go straight to scissors\n   - Rock would be most effective against their probable scissors play\n   - This also protects against them maintaining their historical rock follow-up\n\n[move] rock\n"
