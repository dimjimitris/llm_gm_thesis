    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move has its own merits:\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n   - Paper could beat those who choose rock as a first move\n   - Scissors might surprise opponents\n\n5. Without any additional information, I'll choose paper as my first move:\n   - It beats rock (which is a common first-round choice)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I can learn from this loss\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I can reassess in the next round\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete pattern history:\n   - Early game: Mixed results\n   - Mid game: Long tie streak\n   - Recent rounds:\n     * Round 9: I won (rock vs scissors)\n     * Round 10: Tie (paper vs paper)\n     * Round 11: Tie (rock vs rock)\n   - Their pattern ends: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n2. Pattern observations:\n   - We're falling back into matching moves\n   - They seem to be playing more cautiously\n   - Their moves have become less predictable\n   - They're avoiding losses but not creating wins\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They're playing defensively, matching moves\n   - They might be waiting for me to make a mistake\n   - The pressure is still on them to catch up in score\n   - Both players might be getting too predictable\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - After rock-rock ties, there's often a rush to paper\n   - They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - They could be setting up for scissors\n   - The game needs a pattern breaker\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given the recent defensive play\n   - Considering they might expect paper from me\n   - Taking into account their need to win\n   - They're likely to play scissors anticipating my paper\n   - Rock would maintain the tie streak\n   - Paper would likely lose to scissors\n   - Scissors would be unexpected and break the pattern\n   - Scissors also wins if they try paper to beat expected rock\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Decision:\n   - Given their likely frustration\n   - Considering their need for a win\n   - They'll probably play rock for three reasons:\n     * It beats my previous winning scissors\n     * It's their most reliable move historically\n     * They need a strong counter-move\n   - Therefore, paper would be most effective\n   - This also works if they try rock to establish control\n\n[move] paper\n"
