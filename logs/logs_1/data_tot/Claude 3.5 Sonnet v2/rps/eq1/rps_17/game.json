Psychological dynamics:\n   - Opponent briefly recovered with a tie\n   - But immediately lost again\n   - They're likely feeling:\n     * Frustrated at another loss\n     * Unable to read my strategy\n     * Desperate to find a winning move\n   - Their scissors move failed twice recently\n\n3. Opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They might think I'm overconfident after many wins\n   - Could expect me to stick with successful rock\n   - Might try to finally outthink my strategy\n   - Probably want to avoid scissors (lost with it twice)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect rock again, they'll play paper\n   - If they're tilted, might go back to rock\n   - Very unlikely to play scissors again (recent losses)\n   - They need to break my momentum\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Scissors is the optimal choice because:\n     * Beats paper (their most logical counter to my rock)\n     * They're unlikely to play rock when expecting my rock\n     * They've lost twice with scissors, won't use it again\n     * Breaks my own pattern of repeated rock\n     * Catches them if they try to be clever with paper\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Psychological assessment:\n   - Opponent is likely extremely frustrated\n   - They've lost most rounds\n   - Their logical counters keep failing\n   - They might:\n     * Abandon logical play entirely\n     * Make an emotional decision\n     * Try to be unpredictable\n     * Return to basics\n\n3. Historical patterns:\n   - My last moves: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Their last moves: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've been reactive rather than proactive\n   - They're trying to counter what worked for me previously\n\n4.

Decision making:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice because:\n     * Beats their most likely move (rock)\n     * They're likely to play rock to counter my successful scissors\n     * When highly frustrated, players often resort to rock\n     * They probably won't stick with paper after just losing with it\n     * Maintains pressure while they're struggling to read my strategy\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
