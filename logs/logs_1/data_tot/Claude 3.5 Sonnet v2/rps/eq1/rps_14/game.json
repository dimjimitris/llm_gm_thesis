In rock-paper-scissors, all moves are equally viable in a one-shot game\n4. Each move beats one option and loses to another:\n   - Rock beats scissors, loses to paper\n   - Paper beats rock, loses to scissors \n   - Scissors beats paper, loses to rock\n5. Without any historical data, I should choose randomly to be unpredictable\n6. Rock is often a common first choice for many players, so paper might be advantageous\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Decision:\n   - Given their consecutive losses\n   - Their need to break my prediction ability\n   - Their likely frustration\n   - Rock is the optimal choice because:\n   * They're most likely to play scissors to counter expected paper\n   * They need to break both their losing streak and my winning streak\n   * They've shown they make significant strategy changes after losses\n   * Scissors is their most unused move recently, making it their likely next choice\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "Let me think step by step:\n\n1. Complete game history:\n   - Recent rounds show:\n     * R16: Both paper (tie)\n     * R17: I rock vs paper (lost)\n     * R18: I scissors vs paper (won)\n     * R19: I paper vs rock (won)\n   - Their sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - I'm on a 2-game winning streak\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They finally broke their paper streak with rock\n   - I've correctly predicted their last two moves\n   - They're likely feeling pressured after two losses\n   - Their strategy has become more reactive\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They've lost their last two rounds\n   - Their paper strategy failed, rock counter-strategy also failed\n   - They might feel I'm reading their moves well\n   - They're likely to try something less predictable\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they expect me to predict rock again, they might play scissors\n   - If they're frustrated, they might return to paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, scissors would work\n   - They need to break my winning streak\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Given their recent losses\n   - Their likely frustration with my predictions\n   - Their need to break pattern\n   - Rock is the optimal choice because:\n   * They're most likely to play scissors to break pattern\n   * They might expect me to play paper again after success\n   * They've shown a tendency to switch strategies after failure\n   * Rock is strong against their likely scissors play and safe against potential rock\n\n[move] rock\n"
