The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors\n3. They might try to stay unpredictable since that's worked well for them\n\nGiven their repeated success with scissors against my paper plays, and their demonstrated ability to predict when I'll play paper...\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock because there's a good chance they'll either:\n- Stick with their winning scissors move (as players often do after success)\n- Expect me to play paper again (which they've beaten multiple times) and use scissors\nEither way, rock would be effective against scissors. Even if they try to counter with paper, they've shown they prefer scissors when they think I'm playing paper.\n"
