    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Statistics Analyst - For probability analysis and move distribution\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their playing patterns. In such cases, the Nash equilibrium suggests that each move should be played with equal probability (1/3) to prevent being exploited.\n\nPsychology Expert: First-time players often tend to choose rock as their initial move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this tendency without more data.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Given this is the first move and we have no historical data, we should avoid any strong biases. The optimal mathematical play would indeed be to choose randomly among the three options with equal probability.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with both perspectives. Since we can't predict the opponent's move with certainty, we should focus on making a balanced choice that gives us equal chances against any possible opponent move.\n\nPsychology Expert: While the \"rock bias\" for first moves is interesting, we should stick to a more neutral approach for now until we gather more information about our opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our discussion, we should make a balanced choice that doesn't rely too heavily on assumptions. Paper would be a reasonable choice as it counters the potential \"rock bias\" while not being too risky if we're wrong.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could mean either they're using similar strategic thinking, or it might be part of their pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting what they think the other player will do next. Many players tend to change their move after a tie, thinking their opponent will stick to the same move.\n\nStatistics Analyst: From the first round, we now have one data point showing the opponent chose paper. While this is limited data, we should consider that after a tie, there's often a psychological tendency to switch moves.\n\nGame Strategist: If we assume the opponent is likely to switch from paper (which is a common behavior after a tie), they might choose either rock or scissors. We need to consider which is more likely.\n\nPsychology Expert: The transition from paper to scissors is slightly more common than paper to rock, as players often feel scissors is a more \"aggressive\" move after a defensive paper play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on these insights, if we expect our opponent to likely switch from paper, with a higher probability of choosing scissors, then rock would be our best counter-move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

A player who has a strong preference for paper\n2. A player who recognized our attempt to counter their expected switch and deliberately stayed with paper\n3. Pure coincidence\n\nStatistics Analyst: With two consecutive paper moves, the probability of this being random is decreasing. However, we should be cautious about overcommitting to any single interpretation with just two data points.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown they can maintain the same move despite game theory suggesting switches. They might be using a more straightforward strategy than we anticipated.\n\nPsychology Expert: In this situation, players typically fall into one of two patterns:\n1. Continue with their successful move (paper again)\n2. Switch moves, expecting us to counter their paper streak\n\nStatistics Analyst: Given they've won with paper twice, there's a psychological comfort in sticking with a winning move, but they must also know we're more likely to counter paper now.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I believe the opponent is likely to finally switch their move, expecting us to use scissors to counter their paper streak. If they're thinking this way, they're most likely to switch to rock to counter our expected scissors. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter their probable rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

A very stubborn player who sticks to their move regardless of outcome\n2. A player trying to establish a pattern to trap us\n3. A player who might be using a fixed script or strategy\n\nStatistics Analyst: The probability of randomly choosing paper three times in a row is (1/3)\u00b3 = 1/27, roughly 3.7%. This strongly suggests non-random behavior.\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, the opponent has shown they're willing to stick with paper even when it results in ties. This level of commitment to one move is either extremely naive or extremely calculated.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a classic \"pattern breaking\" moment. After three identical moves, there's immense pressure on both players to change. They must know we're likely to finally counter with scissors.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Given the unusual persistence of paper moves, we should consider that they might finally switch now, expecting us to counter their paper streak.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a critical decision point. While it's tempting to finally use scissors to counter the paper streak, I believe the opponent has been setting up this exact scenario. They've shown unusual commitment to paper, possibly to condition us to finally counter it. I think they'll switch to rock now, expecting our scissors. Therefore:\n\n[move] paper\n"

They can execute well-timed pattern breaks\n\nStatistics Analyst: Our current score is -2 points from four rounds, with two losses and two ties.
