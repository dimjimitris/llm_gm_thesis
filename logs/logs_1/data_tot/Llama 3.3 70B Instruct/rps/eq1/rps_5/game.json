The last round ended in a tie, with both players choosing \"scissors\", extending the tie streak to ten rounds.\n2. The ongoing and unbroken sequence of ties underscores the opponent's unwavering commitment to mirroring my moves, a strategy that has nullified any potential for strategic depth or competitive interaction.\n3. Given this prolonged and unchanging dynamic, the game has transitioned into an exploration of the mirroring behavior's limits and implications rather than a contest of strategic wits.\n4. As the pattern shows no signs of deviation, the decision for this round should reflect an understanding of the game's current state and the role of mirroring in determining its outcome.\n\nGiven the above considerations, my move for this round will be:\n[move] (Continuing to engage with the game, acknowledging the persistent tie streak) rock\n"
