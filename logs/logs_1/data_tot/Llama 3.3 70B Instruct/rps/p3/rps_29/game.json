Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since we are playing against a fresh player, we don't have any information about their preferences. I suggest we start with a neutral move.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the Strategic Thinker. A neutral move would minimize our risk. However, we should also consider the payoff matrix. If we win with rock, we get 1 point, but if we win with paper, we get 3 points.\n\nBehavioral Expert: Since we don't have any information about our opponent's behavior, we should make a move that is less likely to be exploited. Rock is often a popular choice, so our opponent might be expecting us to make this move.\n\nAfter considering the input from all personas, I've decided to make my move.\n\n[move] (Starting with a neutral move to minimize risk and maximize potential reward) rock\n",

Mathematician: This persona will help me calculate the probabilities of each move and optimize my strategy accordingly.\n\nLet's start the collaboration process:\n\nStrategist: To begin, we should consider the payoff matrix of the game. Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any information about their strategy. A good starting point could be to choose a move that has a relatively high expected value.\n\nPsychologist: I agree, but we should also consider the psychological aspect of the game. A fresh player might be more likely to choose a \"beginner's move\" such as rock.\n\nMathematician: From a probabilistic perspective, each move has an equal chance of being chosen (1/3). However, if we assume the opponent is slightly more likely to choose rock, we could adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nConsidering these perspectives, my initial move will be:\n[move] (Choosing rock as a relatively safe starting point, taking into account the potential psychological bias of a fresh player) rock\n",

In this case, a random move is a good starting point. The probability of the opponent choosing rock, paper, or scissors is equal, at 1/3 each.\n\nPsychologist: I agree with the statistician, but we should also consider the possibility that the opponent might try to make a \"safe\" move, such as rock, which is a commonly chosen move.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff matrix, if we choose rock and the opponent chooses scissors, we win 1 point.
