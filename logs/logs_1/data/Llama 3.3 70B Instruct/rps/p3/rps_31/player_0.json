    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Let's continue collaborating with the Strategic Thinker and the Risk Analyst to make the best possible move for the next round.\n\nStrategic Thinker: We've won nineteen rounds in a row, which is a dominant performance. Our opponent might try to make a desperate move to catch up. \n\nRisk Analyst: That's a good point. Since we've been winning consistently with different moves, our opponent might try to choose a move that has a high reward, such as choosing paper to beat our potential rock.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree. Let's think about the moves that can beat paper. Scissors is a good option, as it can beat paper and win us 1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, if our opponent chooses rock, scissors will lose. We need to weigh the risks and benefits of choosing scissors.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Considering the potential risks and benefits, I think choosing scissors is still a good strategy. We have a significant lead, and choosing scissors can help us maintain it.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. But we should also consider the possibility of our opponent trying to repeat a move that has worked for them in the past, or trying to exploit our previous moves.\n\nStrategic Thinker: That's a good point. Let's reconsider our options. If our opponent chooses rock, paper would be a good choice. But if they choose paper, scissors would be a good choice. And if they choose scissors, rock would be a good choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: I think we should choose a move that can beat the move that our opponent is most likely to choose. Since we've been winning with different moves, our opponent might try to choose a move that can beat our most recent move, which was rock. They might choose paper to beat our rock.\n\nStrategic Thinker: In that case, let's choose a move that can beat paper. Scissors is a good option.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Let's go with scissors.\n\n[move] (Choosing scissors to potentially beat paper and maintain our lead) scissors\n"
