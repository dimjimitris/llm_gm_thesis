    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, this very pattern suggests an opportunity.\n\n[move] scissors\nI'm choosing scissors because:\n1) After a rock tie, the conventional and seemingly safe move would be paper\n2) Given our history of thinking alike, my opponent might:\n   - Play paper as it's the logical progression from rock\n   - Expect me to play paper and try to counter with scissors themselves\n3) By playing scissors:\n   - I beat paper if they make the conventional play\n   - Tie with scissors if they think like me\n   - Lose small (-1) to rock if they try to be extra defensive\n4) The high frequency of ties suggests we need to occasionally make less conventional plays to score points, and this seems like a good moment to do so\n"

Now, after losing to scissors, they'll likely adjust their strategy.\n\n[move] rock\nI'm choosing rock because:\n1) After losing to scissors, there are strong psychological incentives for my opponent to:\n   - Play rock to counter scissors (expecting me to use my winning move again)\n   - Play scissors themselves to beat my potential paper play\n2) Rock is strong here because:\n   - It beats scissors if they try to counter potential paper\n   - Ties with rock if they try to counter scissors\n   - While paper would beat rock, they're less likely to play paper right after losing to scissors\n3) While my scissors play just worked, sticking with a winning move is often predictable, and our game history shows we're both good at predicting patterns\n"
