Recent pattern analysis:\n   * Round 11: paper vs scissors (lost -1)\n   * Round 12: rock vs rock (tie 0)\n   * Round 13: paper vs scissors (lost -1)\n   * Opponent cleverly baited with rock then returned to scissors\n   * They're showing higher strategic depth than initially thought\n\n2. Opponent's strategy insight:\n   * They used rock as a temporary deviation\n   * Successfully baited my paper play\n   * Returned to their scissors strategy\n   * They're actively manipulating my expectations\n   * They're more sophisticated than their early scissors fixation suggested\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * I've fallen for their scissors trap twice\n   * They're successfully predicting my paper plays\n   * They're using my own logic against me\n   * I need to stop being predictable with paper after rock\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   * Cannot risk paper again\n   * Need to counter their scissors strategy\n   * Must avoid being baited into obvious plays\n   * Simple, direct counter might be best\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Rock is optimal choice because:\n     - Directly counters their preferred scissors play\n     - Safer option with proven success\n     - Avoids overthinking their strategy\n     - Minimizes risk of being outmaneuvered\n     - Returns to what has worked against their scissors preference\n\n[move] rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
