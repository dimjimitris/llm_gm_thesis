    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent success analysis:\n   - I've won the last three rounds\n   - Just won big with paper (+3)\n   - They've lost twice to different moves (scissors, then paper)\n   - Their last two moves (paper, rock) both lost\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They're likely frustrated after multiple losses\n   - Especially after a big loss (-3) most recently\n   - They might be desperate to break my winning streak\n   - Players often make aggressive moves when desperate\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - After their previous big losses, they've made significant strategy changes\n   - They might expect me to play paper again after its success\n   - My winning streak might make me appear predictable to them\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They're most likely to try to counter my winning paper play\n   - Given their pattern of aggressive responses after big losses\n   - And their likely expectation of me repeating paper\n   - They're highly likely to play scissors\n   - Therefore, rock is the safest and most logical counter\n\n[move] rock I choose rock, expecting them to play scissors to counter my previous winning paper move.\n"
