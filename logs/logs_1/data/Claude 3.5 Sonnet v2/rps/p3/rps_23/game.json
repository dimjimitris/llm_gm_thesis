Analyzing the tie situation:\n   - A tie means both of us were thinking similarly\n   - They've shown they can mirror or predict moves\n   - The game has settled into a more cautious phase\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often look to break the deadlock\n   - They might expect me to shift away from paper\n   - They might try to capitalize on my expected change\n\n4. Strategy consideration:\n   - If I stay with paper, likely another tie or loss to scissors\n   - If I switch to rock, vulnerable to another paper play\n   - If I switch to scissors, could catch them staying with paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They've shown a tendency to adapt\n   - After a tie, there's often an urge to switch moves\n   - Scissors could catch them if they repeat paper or switch to paper\n   - Even if they go rock, I've managed worse losses (-1 vs -3)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.
