However, they're very good at adapting after losses, so they're unlikely to play paper again. After this loss, they might:\n- Play rock to counter my successful scissors\n- Expect me to switch to rock anticipating their scissors\n- Try to break the pattern entirely with an unexpected move\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock because:\n1. After losing to scissors, they've often responded with aggressive scissors plays\n2. They might expect me to get overconfident and repeat scissors\n3. If they try to counter my expected rock with paper, they'll win - but this requires them to make an aggressive choice after just losing\n4. Rock provides good defense against potential aggressive moves while maintaining winning potential\n"
