Recent rounds analysis:\n   - Just lost with scissors against their rock\n   - They successfully stuck with rock for third time\n   - I incorrectly assumed they'd break rock pattern\n   - They showed commitment to defensive strategy\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their recent moves: scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192rock\n   - Three rock moves in recent games\n   - They're showing strong preference for defensive play\n   - My assumption about them being \"tired of rock\" was wrong\n   - They're being more consistent than expected\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They've found success with defensive rock strategy\n   - I got punished for being too clever\n   - They might feel validated in their defensive approach\n   - They might continue this conservative strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After winning with rock, they might:\n     * Finally switch, thinking I'll definitely use paper\n     * Continue rock strategy since it's working\n     * Expect me to overthink again\n   - However, four rock moves would be extremely conservative\n   - They must know paper is the obvious counter to their rock trend\n\n5. Decision:\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n     * It's the direct counter to their rock trend\n     * Sometimes the obvious play is the right play\n     * They can't reasonably expect to succeed with rock again\n     * Even if they predict this obvious counter, I need to test their commitment to rock\n     * If they switch to scissors, it's a necessary loss to gain information\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their recent moves: rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - They used rock pattern to set up scissors play\n   - They're showing higher-level strategic thinking\n   - They effectively used pattern formation as bait\n   - Their play has become more sophisticated\n\n3.
