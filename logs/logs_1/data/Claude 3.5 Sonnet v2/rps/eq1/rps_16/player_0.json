    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing.\n\n3. Since the payoffs are symmetric (+1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for draw), no single move has an inherent advantage.\n\n4. Common psychology in RPS suggests many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n5. If I assume they chose rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n6. However, they might be aware of this tendency and choose paper instead, in which case scissors would be optimal.\n\n7. Given this uncertainty and the equal expected value of all moves, I will make a balanced choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as it counters the most common opening move (rock).\n\n[move] paper\n"

After a tie, players often try to break the pattern by changing their move.\n\n4. Given that we both played paper, there are two likely scenarios:\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper and try to counter it with scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch to scissors (to beat their potential paper) and thus play rock\n\n5. If I believe they're likely to switch to scissors to beat my previous paper, I should play rock.\n\n6. This would also protect against them trying to predict a double-switch scenario.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock to counter their potential switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observations:\n   - We've had many ties (6 total)\n   - They still haven't used rock once in 11 rounds\n   - Their pattern is heavily scissors-focused with occasional paper\n   - We've had three ties in the last four rounds\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Multiple consecutive ties often lead to pattern breaks\n   - They might be frustrated with the frequent ties\n   - Their aversion to rock has become a defining characteristic\n   - They might finally use rock to break both:\n     * The tie streak\n     * Their no-rock pattern\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - After scissors-tie rounds, they've historically:\n     * Either maintained scissors\n     * Or switched to paper\n   - The abundance of ties might force a strategy change\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock would be safe against their historical scissors preference\n   - Paper would win if they finally use rock or maintain scissors\n   - Scissors would only win if they switch to paper\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock. Given their historical preference for scissors, the frustration of multiple ties, and the need to break patterns, rock provides the safest play while also countering their most common move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
