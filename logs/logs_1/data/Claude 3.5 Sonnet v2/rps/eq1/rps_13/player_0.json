    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Specialist in analyzing patterns and predicting behaviors\n3. Risk Manager - Expert in assessing and managing risks in decision-making\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should start with basic game theory. In a single-shot game with no prior information, each move should theoretically have an equal 1/3 probability of being optimal.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Also, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" This is a common human tendency in first-time plays.\n\nRisk Manager: While that's useful information, we should also consider that since this is just the first move, we shouldn't be too aggressive in our strategy. Paper would counter the common \"rock\" first move, but we should also consider the risk of them choosing scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the Pattern Analyst's insight about rock being a common first move, and considering the Risk Manager's point about balanced risk, I would suggest going with paper. It beats the most common first move (rock) while having the same risk profile as any other choice in a single-shot game.\n\nPattern Analyst: I concur with this analysis. Paper has the psychological advantage of potentially catching a first-time rock player while not being any riskier than other options.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The potential upside of catching a \"rock\" player outweighs the balanced risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on the likelihood of a first-time player choosing rock, and maintaining a balanced risk profile.\n"

They anticipated our paper strategy\n2. They have a natural preference for scissors\n3. It was a random choice that happened to work against us\n\nGame Strategist: This is valuable information. We now know one data point about their behavior. Players who win with a particular move sometimes tend to stick with it due to the success reinforcement. However, more strategic players might anticipate that we'll counter their previous winning move.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider both possibilities:\n1. If they're success-reinforced, they might play scissors again\n2. If they're more strategic, they might anticipate us playing rock (to counter their previous scissors) and thus switch to paper\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at typical player psychology, most players are more likely to stick with a winning move than to engage in complex strategic thinking, especially in casual games.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. It directly counters their previous winning move (scissors) if they repeat it\n2. Even if they switch to paper, we've only lost two rounds but gained valuable information about their strategy level\n3. If they switch to rock, we tie and stop our losing streak\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with this assessment.

A strong preference for scissors\n2. A very simple playing style\n3. An attempt to establish a pattern to trick us\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they stuck with scissors even after we could have predicted it suggests they might be playing with a relatively simple strategy. However, we should be careful about getting too confident in this assessment.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n1. They play scissors again (showing a strong habit)\n2. They finally switch to counter our rock (suggesting they learn and adapt)\n3. They try to surprise us with paper (a more sophisticated strategy)\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they've shown no adaptation yet despite losing the last round, there's a higher probability they either:\na) Have a strong preference for scissors, or\nb) Will finally adapt and try to counter our rock with paper\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's persistence with scissors despite losing suggests they might not be employing complex strategies. However, this could be the perfect moment for them to switch tactics.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I recommend we stay with rock for one more round. Here's why:\n1. If they're habit-bound, we'll win again\n2. If they switch to paper, we lose but gain crucial information about their adaptability\n3.

Choose the move that would have beaten their previous move\n\nRisk Manager: Based on this pattern analysis:\n1. If they follow their \"two rounds per move\" pattern, they should be switching\n2.

The pressure might paradoxically make them more predictable through tilt\n\nPattern Analyst: In high-pressure situations with multiple consecutive losses, players often:\n1. Return to their \"comfort move\" (their early success was with scissors)\n2. Try to \"counter what worked last time\" (play paper to beat our rock)\n3.

The psychological pressure of four straight losses typically pushes players toward \"safe\" or \"neutral\" choices like paper, rather than aggressive (scissors) or defensive (rock) options.\n\nPattern Analyst: The combination of tilt, frustration, and the need to break their losing streak makes paper their most likely choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on the extreme psychological pressure of four consecutive losses likely causing the opponent to choose paper as a \"safe\" middle option or as a counter to our previous winning rock move.\n"
