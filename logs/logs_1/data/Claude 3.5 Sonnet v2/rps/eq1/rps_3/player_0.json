    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is rock-paper-scissors. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game called rock-paper-scissors with other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating different move choices and their outcomes\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing without prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen for optimal play.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Since this is the first interaction, we can't rely on psychological patterns yet. However, some studies suggest that \"rock\" is the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- If we play rock: Win vs scissors (+1), Lose vs paper (-1), Tie vs rock (0)\n- If we play paper: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: Win vs paper (+1), Lose vs rock (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\nGiven the Psychology Expert's input about \"rock\" being a common first move, I suggest we play paper.\n\nGame Strategist: That's a reasonable approach. While in the long run we should maintain unpredictability, for this single first move, exploiting common human behavior could give us an edge.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Playing paper gives us a good chance to win against a likely rock play, while maintaining balanced odds against other possibilities.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They're also using strategic thinking\n2. It was a random choice\n3. They might have a particular preference for paper\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move, thinking their opponent will switch too. However, some players might stick to their previous move, believing their opponent will expect a change.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- If opponent expects us to change from paper, they might play scissors to counter\n- If opponent thinks we'll stick with paper, they might stick with paper too\n- Given the tie, there's psychological pressure to change moves\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, I suggest we play rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors (which opponent might play expecting us to use paper again)\n2. If opponent sticks with paper, we only lose one point\n3. It's a complete change from our previous move, which maintains unpredictability\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with playing rock. The psychological tendency to change moves after a tie makes scissors a likely choice for our opponent, which rock would beat.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Let's go with rock to counter the likely scissors play while maintaining reasonable outcomes against other possibilities.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pure coincidence\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive paper plays by the opponent is significant. They've found success with this move and might be tempted to use it again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll expect paper and switch their strategy. This is a critical psychological moment.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our situation:\n- Current pattern: Opponent: paper\u2192paper, Us: paper\u2192rock\n- We've scored: 0, -1 points\n- If opponent plays paper a third time, it could suggest a fixed strategy\n- However, they might expect us to counter with scissors and switch to rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given the opponent's success with paper, they face a decision:\n1. Stick with what's working (paper)\n2. Anticipate our scissors counter and switch to rock\n3. Make a complete strategy change to scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: When players have success with a strategy, they often stick with it until it fails. However, three identical moves in a row is psychologically uncomfortable for many players.\n\nRisk Analyst: Despite the risk of them switching, scissors appears to be our best move:\n1. It directly counters their demonstrated paper preference\n2. If they switch to rock, we only lose one point\n3. We need to break their winning streak\n\nAI Assistant: I agree.
