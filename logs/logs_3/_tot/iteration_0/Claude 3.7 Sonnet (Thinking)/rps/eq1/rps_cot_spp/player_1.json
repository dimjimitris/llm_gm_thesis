    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In classic game theory, the Nash equilibrium for rock-paper-scissors is to play each option with equal 1/3 probability. This makes your strategy unpredictable and optimal against rational opponents.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed, we have no prior data. However, there are some psychological tendencies in first moves. Research suggests many players choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper would be a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nDecision Strategist: Both good points. Without prior history, we need to balance game theory with human psychology. Paper is a reasonable first move given the potential psychological bias toward rock, but we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the opponent's patterns in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: Remember that our goal is to maximize points over multiple rounds, so establishing unpredictability early is also important.\n\nDecision Strategist: I recommend going with paper for the first move based on the psychological tendency, but we should re-evaluate after seeing the opponent's first choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This could mean a few things:\n1. They might have been using the same psychological reasoning we did\n2. They could be using a random strategy\n3. They might now switch to a different move to avoid another tie\n\nGame Theorist: Given that both players chose paper in round 1, we need to predict the opponent's likely adaptation. Many players, after a tie, will switch their move rather than repeating. The opponent might expect us to stay with paper (thinking we found it successful) or switch to scissors (to beat their paper). If they expect us to stay with paper, they might play scissors. If they expect us to switch to scissors, they might play rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: I think the most likely scenario is that the opponent will switch to scissors to beat our previous paper move. Therefore, choosing rock would be a strategic counter. This anticipates their adaptation while protecting against the most likely shift in their strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agree with that reasoning. Most players don't repeat the same move after a tie, and scissors would be the logical next choice if they're thinking one step ahead.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is indeed the optimal choice if we predict the opponent will play scissors. However, we should continue to vary our strategy in subsequent rounds to remain unpredictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Both players chose paper in round 1, then both switched to rock in round 2. This suggests the opponent might be using similar reasoning to ours or possibly even mirroring our moves (though they wouldn't know our move in advance).\n\nGame Theorist: The consecutive ties create an interesting psychological situation. There's now pressure to break the tie pattern. Looking at the sequence so far (paper \u2192 rock), if the opponent is following a cycling pattern, they might play scissors next. However, they might also anticipate that we'll try to counter their next move.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that we've gone from paper to rock, the natural progression in a rock-paper-scissors cycle would be to scissors next. However, if the opponent is thinking similarly, they might also choose scissors, resulting in another tie. Alternatively, they might anticipate our scissors and play rock again.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's another possibility - the opponent might be deliberately playing for ties. But that's less likely given the scoring system.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, I would recommend playing paper. If they follow the natural cycle to scissors, our paper loses. But if they anticipate our scissors and play rock again, our paper wins. Given the pattern so far, this covers the most strategic option.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree.

Looking at the full sequence so far:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 3: Our paper vs their scissors (we lost)\n\nThis suggests the opponent might be starting to read our pattern or they're following their own cyclical strategy. They've now played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is a common sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has now completed the full cycle of moves. In many cases, players will either:\n1. Continue the cycle (returning to paper next)\n2. Switch to a counter-strategy now that they've won a round\n3. Repeat their winning move (scissors again)\n\nDecision Strategist: Given these possibilities, we need to cover the most likely scenario. If they continue their cycle, they'll play paper next. If they repeat their winning move, they'll play scissors again. If they try to counter what they think we'll play, it becomes more complex.\n\nGame Theorist: I think playing rock gives us the best odds here. It beats scissors if they repeat their winning move, and it would at worst tie if they play rock again. The only downside is losing to paper if they continue their cycle.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Based on psychological principles, players often repeat winning moves, making scissors a likely choice for them. Rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nDecision Strategist: Rock is the safest bet right now.

Establishing a new pattern\n3. Using a higher-order strategy against our counter-strategy\n\nDecision Strategist: After playing rock twice in a row, they're less likely to play rock a third time. Players rarely triple-repeat moves. They'll likely switch to paper or scissors next.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their previous behavior, when they break a pattern, they tend to either restart their cycle or continue with unpredictability. The fact that they played rock twice suggests they might be moving away from their strict cycle.\n\nGame Theorist: In this case of uncertainty, paper is our safest move. It beats rock if they repeat it again, ties with paper if they switch to that, and only loses to scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with the paper recommendation. It protects against repeated rock play and gives us the best expected value given the uncertainty we're now facing.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They might have switched to a reverse cycle strategy (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) rather than their original (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors). If they're following this new reverse pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: This could be deliberate or coincidental. But if they are indeed using a reverse cycle now, rock would be our optimal counter to their expected scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: The switch to a reverse pattern would be a clever adaptation - it maintains the structure they're comfortable with while countering our counter-strategy. The fact that they played paper after rock supports this hypothesis.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock as our next move. If they're following the reverse cycle, they'll play scissors and we'll win. If they play paper again, we'll lose, but gain valuable information about their new strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with rock.

After playing rock twice with a paper in between, they're statistically less likely to play rock again.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that they've just played rock twice in the last three rounds, paper would statistically be a safer bet than scissors. Players tend to avoid the same move too many times in quick succession.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's another possibility - they might be trying to mirror our moves with a one-round delay, which would explain the recent ties. If that's the case, they would play paper next (matching our paper from round 12).\n\nGame Theorist: If they're mirroring with a delay, scissors would counter their expected paper. If they're playing statistically, paper would be safest against their expected switch from rock. Given the uncertainty, I think scissors gives us the best risk-reward profile.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with scissors.

Instead of playing paper as expected, they played rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a significant development. After we exploited their pattern for three straight wins, they've finally adjusted. This suggests they're now aware we've figured them out.\n\nDecision Strategist: The question now is whether they'll:\n1. Play completely randomly going forward\n2. Establish a new pattern\n3. Try to counter-predict what we'll do next\n\nPattern Analyst: After breaking a long-established pattern with rock, players are statistically less likely to play rock again immediately. There's a psychological tendency to avoid repeating the same move too many times.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this break in pattern, our safest approach would be paper. It would beat rock if they repeat their last move, tie with paper if they switch to that, and only lose to scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. After breaking their pattern with rock, they're less likely to play rock again immediately. Paper gives us our best expected value in this uncertain situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Their last two moves (rock \u2192 scissors) might indicate they're trying to predict and counter what we'll play.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to be careful not to fall into a predictable counter-pattern ourselves. After losing to scissors with paper, many players would instinctively play rock next, which they might be anticipating.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their rock \u2192 scissors sequence could be the start of a new pattern, or it could be purely reactive to our moves. It's too early to tell which.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation with high uncertainty, rock would be our safest move. It beats their scissors if they repeat it, and would only lose to paper. Given they've just played scissors, there's a psychological tendency to avoid immediate repetition.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with rock. It protects against repeated scissors and avoids the obvious counter-strategy they might expect (us playing scissors to counter their anticipated paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After breaking their original pattern, they've now played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which is actually their original cycle but in reverse order.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a sophisticated adaptation! They appear to have switched to a reverse cycle (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) instead of their original (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors). If they're following this reverse pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to be careful about this hypothesis. It could also be coincidental. But if they are indeed using a reverse cycle now, paper would be our optimal counter to their expected rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: The switch to a reverse pattern would be a clever adaptation - it maintains structure they're comfortable with while countering our counter-strategy. The complete reversal of their original pattern seems deliberate.\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend paper as our next move. If they're following the reverse cycle, they'll play rock and we'll win. If they play scissors, we'll lose, but gain valuable information about their new strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with paper.
