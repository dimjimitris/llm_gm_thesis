To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nLet's double check this by reviewing the last few moves:\n- Their move: rock \u2192 My move: paper (I won)\n- Their move: scissors \u2192 My move: rock (I won)\n- Their move: paper \u2192 My move: scissors (I won)\n- Their move: rock \u2192 My move: paper (I won)\n- Their move: scissors \u2192 My move: rock (I won)\n\nYes, they're following the rock-scissors-paper pattern consistently, and their last move was scissors, so they'll likely play paper next. I should play scissors to counter.",
