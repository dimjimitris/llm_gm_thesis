    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If opponent plays rock, my best counter is scissors (+1)\n7. If opponent plays paper, my best counter is rock (+3)\n8. If opponent plays scissors again, paper would win again (+1)\n9.

So the cycle is reversed compared to traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n6. Looking at my opponent's moves: scissors \u2192 rock\n7.

Let me analyze the complete gameplay pattern:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 4-21: This exact pattern continues perfectly\n\n2. The opponent's move pattern remains completely consistent:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4-21: This exact pattern continues perfectly\n\n3. They are cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper...\n\n4. Based on this perfectly predictable pattern, they will play scissors next.\n\n5. Against scissors, my best counter is paper (+1 points).\n\n6. The opponent has shown no variation in their pattern through 21 rounds.\n\n7. This makes my prediction extremely reliable.\n\n8. Paper gives me a consistent point gain (+1) against their expected scissors move.\n\n9. I'll continue with the counter-strategy that has been 100% successful.\n\n10. The optimal move is clear.\n\n[move] paper"
