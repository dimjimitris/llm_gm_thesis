    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the game's rules and payoffs:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I should evaluate each possible move:\n   - Rock: Could win 3 points (against Paper) or lose 1 point (against Scissors)\n   - Paper: Could win 1 point (against Scissors) or lose 3 points (against Rock)\n   - Scissors: Could win 1 point (against Rock) or lose 1 point (against Paper)\n\n3. Rock offers the highest potential gain (3 points) with a relatively small potential loss (-1)\n   - This gives Rock the best risk/reward ratio among all moves\n\n4. Since I have no prior information about my opponent's strategy, maximizing my potential gain while minimizing potential loss seems optimal.\n\n5. Therefore, I'll choose Rock for my first move.\n\n[move] rock"

I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They may play rock again (stick with what worked)\n   - They may anticipate I'll play rock again and choose paper to counter\n   - They may try to be unpredictable with scissors\n\n3. Evaluating my options:\n   - Rock: High reward (3 points) if they play paper, but could lose 1 point against scissors\n   - Paper: Would beat rock if they play it again, but vulnerable to scissors\n   - Scissors: Would counter paper if they switch to it, but vulnerable to rock\n\n4. My opponent knows I played rock last time. A common strategy would be for them to switch to paper to beat my previous rock.\n\n5. If I assume they're thinking one step ahead and will play paper, my best counter is to play scissors.\n\n6. However, there's also a possibility they might anticipate this and play rock again to beat my scissors.\n\n7. Considering the payoff matrix and likely opponent moves, paper seems like a reasonable choice as it would:\n   - Win against rock (which my opponent already played once)\n   - Only lose 1 point if they play scissors (which is less likely based on the previous round)\n\n[move] paper"

Wait, there seems to be confusion here. Let me revisit the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner 3 points, loser -3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n\n3. According to these rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. But I was told I won with paper against scissors.\n\n4. Given this information, I have two interpretations:\n   - Either the rules were stated incorrectly\n   - Or the result interpretation was incorrect\n\n5. I'll base my next move on the pattern I've seen from my opponent:\n   - They've played rock, then scissors\n   - This could indicate they're cycling through moves or responding to my choices\n\n6. If they're cycling, they might play paper next\n   - To counter paper, I should play rock (which gives 3 points if I win)\n\n7. If they're responding to my moves, they might anticipate me playing scissors (to counter their scissors) and play rock\n   - In that case, paper would be my best move\n\n8.
