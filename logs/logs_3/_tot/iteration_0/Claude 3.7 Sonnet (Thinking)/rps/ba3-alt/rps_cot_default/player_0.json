    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoffs are unusual: paper beats rock (3/-3 points), scissors beats paper (1/-1 points), and rock beats scissors (1/-1 points).\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet.\n4. If I assume the opponent might play randomly with equal probability for each move, I should calculate expected values.\n5. For rock: (0 points if tie + (-3) points vs paper + 1 point vs scissors)/3 = -0.67 points expected\n6. For paper: (3 points vs rock + 0 points if tie + (-1) point vs scissors)/3 = 0.67 points expected\n7. For scissors: (-1 point vs rock + 1 point vs paper + 0 points if tie)/3 = 0 points expected\n8. Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n9. The high reward of winning with paper against rock (3 points) outweighs the smaller penalty of losing to scissors (-1 point).\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing their tendencies:\n   - They've played rock most frequently (5 times out of 11 moves)\n   - Their last three moves show: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - After playing rock in the past, they've followed with rock, paper, and rock\n\n4. Considering what might follow rock in their pattern:\n   - After rock in round 1, they played rock again\n   - After rock in round 6, they played paper\n   - After rock in round 8, they played scissors\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - Since I've just won with scissors against their rock, they might expect me to play scissors again\n   - If they play paper to counter my expected scissors, scissors would lose\n   - If they play scissors anticipating me switching to rock, scissors would tie\n   - If they play rock again (which they've done multiple times), scissors would win again\n\n6. Given their tendency to play rock frequently and my recent success with scissors, I'll continue with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
