In Rock-Paper-Scissors, without additional information, no single move has an inherent advantage. However, I can try to anticipate what the opponent might do based on psychology:\n\n1. After a tie with both players playing paper, the opponent might:\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to rock thinking I'll switch to scissors\n   - Stick with paper thinking I'll change\n\nSince scissors beats paper (giving 1 point), paper beats rock (giving 3 points), and rock beats scissors (giving 1 point), the expected value of each move depends on my prediction of the opponent's move.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points when beating rock), many players might avoid using rock after a tie. So the opponent might be more likely to choose scissors or paper again.\n\nIf I predict the opponent will play scissors, I should play rock.\nIf I predict the opponent will play paper again, I should play scissors.\n\nWithout more information about this specific opponent, I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they might switch to scissors after our tie with paper.",

In round 1, we both played paper, suggesting either a common opening strategy or coincidence. In round 2, my opponent played scissors, which would have beaten my previous move (paper). This could indicate they're using a strategy of playing whatever would have beaten the previous move.\n\nIf that pattern continues, they might play rock next (to beat my scissors). But I actually played rock, not scissors. So if they're basing their next move on my actual previous move, they might play paper to beat my rock.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n- If I play rock again: I'd lose to paper (-3 points), but beat scissors (+1 point)\n- If I play paper: I'd lose to scissors (-1 point), but beat rock (+3 points)\n- If I play scissors: I'd lose to rock (-1 point), but beat paper (+1 point)\n\nSince my opponent played scissors last time and lost, they might change their strategy. One common response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's move.

It doesn't appear to be a simple repeating pattern.\n\nLet me look at whether my opponent is adapting to my moves:\n- When I play rock: They've played scissors (I win), rock (tie), paper (I lose), rock (tie), rock (tie)\n- When I play paper: They've played paper (tie), scissors (I lose), paper (tie), scissors (I lose), scissors (I lose)\n- When I play scissors: They've played paper (I win), paper (I win), scissors (tie), rock (I lose), paper (I win), rock (I lose), rock (I lose)\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be adapting to my previous moves. There's a possibility they're using a strategy that predicts my next move based on previous patterns. For example, they might be assuming I'll repeat successful moves.\n\nMy current score:\n- 4 wins (1+1+1+1 = 4 points)\n- 5 ties (0+0+0+0+0 = 0 points)\n- 8 losses (-1-3-1-1-1-1-1 = -9 points)\nTotal: -5 points\n\nSince paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points when winning against rock), but also the highest potential loss (-3 when losing to scissors), it's a high-risk, high-reward move. Scissors and rock are lower risk/reward (1/-1 points).\n\nSince I've been losing more than winning, I should try to change my strategy. I'll go with paper this time to aim for that higher reward if my opponent plays rock (which they've done several times recently).",

In round 1, we both played paper, suggesting either a common opening strategy or coincidence. In round 2, my opponent played scissors, which would have beaten my previous move (paper). This could indicate they're using a strategy of playing whatever would have beaten the previous move.\n\nIf that pattern continues, they might play rock next (to beat my scissors). But I actually played rock, not scissors. So if they're basing their next move on my actual previous move, they might play paper to beat my rock.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n- If I play rock again: I'd lose to paper (-3 points), but beat scissors (+1 point)\n- If I play paper: I'd lose to scissors (-1 point), but beat rock (+3 points)\n- If I play scissors: I'd lose to rock (-1 point), but beat paper (+1 point)\n\nSince my opponent played scissors last time and lost, they might change their strategy. One common response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's move. So they might play paper this time to beat my rock.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll play scissors to counter the anticipated paper move.",

However, let me check if there's a pattern in their recent moves:\n\nLast 5 rounds:\nRound 11: opponent played scissors\nRound 12: opponent played paper\nRound 13: opponent played rock\nRound 14: opponent played rock\nRound 15: opponent played scissors\n\nThere might be a simple pattern forming. The opponent seems to have played rock twice in a row and now scissors. If they're using a rock-rock-scissors-paper pattern, their next move might be paper. So I should play scissors.\n\nBut let me also look at my recent moves and see if the opponent is reacting to those:\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (countering me)\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (not countering)\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played rock (mirroring)\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played rock (countering me)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (countering me)\n\nIn the last 3 rounds, the opponent has countered or mirrored my moves. If they're looking to counter my next move, and I play rock, they might play paper.\n\nGiven the possible patterns and the fact that my opponent has countered me in 2 of the last 3 rounds, I think playing rock would be risky as it would lose to paper (-3 points). Playing paper would be risky if they play scissors (-1 point). Playing scissors would be risky if they play rock (-1 point).\n\nSince losing with rock has the highest penalty (-3), I'll avoid that and choose between scissors and paper. Since scissors beat paper for +1 and paper beats rock for +3, paper has a higher potential upside. But if I've been too predictable, they might expect paper and counter with scissors.\n\nI think I'll try rock here as my opponent might be expecting scissors or paper from me based on my recent moves.",
