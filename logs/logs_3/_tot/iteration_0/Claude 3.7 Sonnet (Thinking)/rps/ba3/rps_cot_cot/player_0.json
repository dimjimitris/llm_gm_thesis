    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3), while its potential loss (-1) is minimal.\n\n4. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to throw rock as their first move.\n\n5. Even if they don't play rock, the downside of playing paper is limited (-1 if they play scissors).\n\n6. The risk-reward ratio for paper is the most favorable in this first round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's move pattern:\n   - They've played paper most frequently (Rounds 1, 3, 5, 8, 11)\n   - Paper has been their most common move, especially when they're losing\n\n3. They've now lost 8 rounds and tied 3, with no wins.\n\n4. After just losing with paper to my scissors, they'll likely switch moves.\n\n5. They're probably expecting me to play scissors again (since it worked).\n\n6. Their most strategic move would be rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\n7. If I expect them to play rock, my optimal response is paper.\n\n8.

After a tie with the same move (paper), players typically don't play the same move again immediately.\n\n4. My opponent has shown adaptability and strategic thinking throughout the game.\n\n5. Since we just tied with paper, they're likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\n6. Given their past success against my rock plays, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their recent paper tendency.\n\n7. If they think I'll play scissors, their optimal move would be rock.\n\n8. If I predict they'll play rock, my best counter is paper.\n\n9. However, this is becoming predictable. Given we just tied with paper, a better strategic choice would be scissors:\n   - If they play paper again: I win +1\n   - If they switch to rock: I lose -1\n   - If they play scissors: Tie (0)\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-17: Various results\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 19: rock (loss)\n   - Round 20: paper (win)\n   - Round 21: scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: rock (win)\n\n3. After just winning with rock, my opponent has two common psychological tendencies:\n   - Continue with the winning move (rock)\n   - Anticipate that I'll counter their rock with paper and play scissors\n\n4. Throughout the game, my opponent has demonstrated good adaptability and strategic thinking.\n\n5. While it's tempting to play paper to counter potential repeated rock, that might be what they're expecting.\n\n6. Looking at their pattern, they've never played the same move three times in a row, suggesting they're likely to switch from rock.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper (the logical counter to their rock), they'll likely play scissors.\n\n8. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, my best move is rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock"
