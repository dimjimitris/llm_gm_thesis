      "reasoning_text": "I see that the previous round ended in a tie because both the other player and I chose paper. Now I need to make a new move for the next round.\n\nLet's think about what this means:\n- The other player chose paper in the first round\n- This could be their default starting strategy, or they might have similar reasoning to what I had\n- Now that we've both seen each other choose paper, we need to predict what they'll do next\n\nGiven that we both chose paper, the other player might anticipate that I'll stick with paper or shift to scissors (to beat their paper). If they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock to counter. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock (assuming they'll stick with paper), and so they might choose scissors to counter my anticipated rock.\n\nThis is getting into multiple layers of prediction, which is the classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Let me analyze the payoff structure again:\n\n- If I choose rock:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: -3 points (I lose)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\n- If I choose paper:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: +3 points (I win)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n- If I choose scissors:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: -1 point (I lose)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: +1 point (I win)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nBased on game theory and the common pattern in RPS, players often shift strategies after a tie. Since we both played paper, there's a higher likelihood the opponent will switch to scissors to counter the previous paper play. To counter their potential scissors, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, if they're thinking multiple steps ahead, they might anticipate my rock and play paper. But I think the first-level prediction (they'll play scissors) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose rock for this round.",

Play scissors again if they think I'll switch to paper\n\nThis is getting into the recursive thinking of rock-paper-scissors strategy. Since I just won with rock, there's a reasonable chance my opponent might expect me to use rock again (since it was successful), and therefore they might play paper to counter.\n\nIf they think I'll anticipate that and switch to scissors, they might play rock.\n\nGiven the scoring system, paper beats rock for 3 points, which is more valuable than scissors beating paper (1 point).

Paper beating rock has a higher payoff (3 points) than the other winning combinations (1 point). This makes paper a potentially more attractive choice if I expect my opponent to play rock.\n\nI'm playing against a fresh player, which means they haven't played before and I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\nFor the first move, without any information about my opponent, I need to consider the expected value of each move:\n\n1.

But since they are a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't had time to develop this level of meta-reasoning.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs and the fact that I'm playing against a fresh player who likely hasn't had time to develop a meta-strategy, I'll choose paper for my first move.",

If they think I'll choose scissors, they might choose rock to counter. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock (assuming they'll stick with paper), and so they might choose scissors to counter my anticipated rock.\n\nThis is getting into multiple layers of prediction, which is the classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Let me analyze the payoff structure again:\n\n- If I choose rock:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: -3 points (I lose)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\n- If I choose paper:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: +3 points (I win)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n- If I choose scissors:\n  - If opponent chooses rock: -1 point (I lose)\n  - If opponent chooses paper: +1 point (I win)\n  - If opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nBased on game theory and the common pattern in RPS, players often shift strategies after a tie. Since we both played paper, there's a higher likelihood the opponent will switch to scissors to counter the previous paper play. To counter their potential scissors, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, if they're thinking multiple steps ahead, they might anticipate my rock and play paper. But I think the first-level prediction (they'll play scissors) is more likely.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose rock for this round.",
