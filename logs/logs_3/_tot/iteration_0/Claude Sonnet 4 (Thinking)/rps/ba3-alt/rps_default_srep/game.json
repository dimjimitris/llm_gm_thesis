You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The opponent seems to be adapting to my moves or playing somewhat unpredictably. \n\nI've lost every single round so far. My total score is -8 points.\n\nLet me think about what might work. The opponent has played:\n- Scissors: 3 times (rounds 1, 2, 4)\n- Paper: 2 times (rounds 3, 6) \n- Rock: 1 time (round 5)\n\nIf I had to guess their next move based on frequency, scissors seems most likely. But they might also be trying to mix it up.\n\nGiven that I need to start winning some points, and rock gives the highest reward (+3), maybe I should try rock again. If they play paper, I lose -3, but if they play scissors, I win +1. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. I've been trying to predict their moves but failing. Maybe I should focus on the expected value of each move:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- vs scissors: +1 (opponent has played scissors 3/6 times = 50%)\n- vs paper: -3 (opponent has played paper 2/6 times = 33%)\n- vs rock: 0 (opponent has played rock 1/6 times = 17%)\n\nExpected value = 0.5(1) + 0.33(-3) + 0.17(0) = 0.5 - 0.99 + 0 = -0.49\n \nI calculate the expected values for paper and scissors. Paper looks slightly more promising with a positive expected value of 0.01, compared to rock's negative -0.49. The potential to win +3 against rock seems appealing, even though the probability is low. Scissors has an incomplete calculation, so I can't fully assess its potential.\n\nWhen I factor in the probabilities of my opponent's moves, scissors emerges as the most strategic choice with a 0.16 expected value. This suggests scissors provides the most balanced approach given the observed play patterns.\n\nI choose scissors as my optimal move.",
