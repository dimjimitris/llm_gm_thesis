They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something else\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\nSince I played paper and won, they might think I'll play paper again, so they might play scissors again to beat paper. Or they might think I'll switch.\n\nGiven that this is described as a \"fresh player\", they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. I should consider what gives me the best expected value.\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Beats scissors (+1 point)\n- Loses to paper (-3 points)\n- Ties with rock (0 points)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- Beats rock (+3 points)\n- Loses to scissors (-1 point)\n- Ties with paper (0 points)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Beats paper (+1 point)\n- Loses to rock (-1 point)\n- Ties with scissors (0 points)\n\nSince rock beats paper gives +3/-3 points, that's the highest reward/penalty combination.

Let me re-read... \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" - ah, so paper DOES beat scissors. I was thinking of traditional rock-paper-scissors, but this game has different rules).\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\nSo the opponent played: scissors, then rock.\n\nLet me think about what they might play next. They seem to be trying different moves. They might go for paper next to complete trying all three options, or they might try to counter what they think I'll play.\n\nSince I played paper then rock, they might expect scissors next from me, so they might play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut I should think strategically about the payoff matrix:\n- paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- rock beats paper: +3/-3  \n- scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nRock beating paper gives the most points (+3), so if I can predict they'll play paper, I should play rock. But scissors beating rock also gives +1, so if I think they'll play rock, scissors is good.\n\nGiven their pattern so far (scissors, rock), they might try paper next. If so, I should play rock for the big +3 points.",

This seems wrong according to the rules - scissors should beat paper, not the other way around.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo according to these rules, paper beats scissors.

The game description says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBut in the result, it says I made paper, opponent made scissors, and I won with 1 point. But according to the rules, paper beats scissors, so that's correct - I should get 1 point.\n\nWait, let me re-read this:\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo paper does beat scissors, and I get 1 point. That's correct.\n\nBut my reasoning was wrong - I thought the opponent would play rock (which paper beats for 3 points), but they played scissors (which beats paper). Actually wait, no - paper beats scissors, so I was lucky that they played scissors instead of rock.\n\nLet me think about this strategically. The opponent played scissors in the first round. This could be random, or they might have some pattern. Since I don't have much information yet, I should consider:\n\n1. Rock beats paper (3 points)\n2. Paper beats scissors (1 point) \n3. Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nThe highest scoring move is when rock beats paper (3 points). So if I think the opponent will play paper, I should play rock. If they might play scissors again, I should play rock (scissors beats rock, but rock beats paper). If they play rock, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven that they played scissors last time, they might switch to something else. Many players might think \"I played scissors and lost, so let me try rock next.\" If they play rock, I should play scissors to get 1 point.\n\nBut rock vs paper gives 3 points, which is the highest payoff.
