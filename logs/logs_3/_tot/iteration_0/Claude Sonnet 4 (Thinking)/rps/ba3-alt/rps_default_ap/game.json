Each choice has different point values depending on the opponent's move. Paper offers a mix of potential gains and risks - winning against scissors but losing big to rock. Rock seems more versatile, with a chance for a 3-point win against paper. Scissors remains the most uncertain option, with an incomplete strategy.\n\nMy current analysis suggests playing paper might provide the most strategic advantage, especially if I anticipate a rock play from my opponent.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
