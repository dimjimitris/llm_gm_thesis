    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant strategically before making my move. Let me identify helpful personas and collaborate with them.\n\n**Personas**: AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Risk Analysis Expert; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3 (high stakes)\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 (low stakes) \n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 (low stakes)\n\nThe key insight is that rock has both the highest reward (+3) and creates the highest penalty (-3) for the opponent. This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent, we should consider both the expected value and the strategic implications.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: From a risk perspective, rock is a double-edged sword. If the opponent expects us to play rock (since it has the highest payoff), they might counter with paper. However, the +3 payoff makes rock very attractive. Paper is the safest defensive move against rock, while scissors is relatively safe with moderate upside against rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know our tendencies yet. Fresh players often have predictable patterns - many default to rock (it feels strong), some choose scissors (it's the \"cutting\" option), and others pick paper (it's neutral). Given the scoring system heavily favors rock wins, a fresh player might be drawn to rock initially.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given that this is our first move against a fresh player, I recommend avoiding rock initially. Here's why: if they also choose rock (common for new players), it's a tie with 0 points. If they choose paper (anticipating rock), we lose 3 points. The risk seems too high for the first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So you're suggesting either paper or scissors for the opening move?\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Yes, I'd lean toward paper. It counters rock (which new players often choose) for a +1 gain, and only loses -1 to scissors. The risk-reward ratio is more favorable than rock for an opening move against an unknown opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with paper. It's a solid defensive choice that capitalizes on the tendency of new players to choose rock, while minimizing our downside risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the analysis, I'll play paper as my opening move. It offers good protection against rock (which new players often choose) while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "The round ended in a tie with both players choosing paper. This gives me valuable information about my opponent's thinking. Let me collaborate with my personas again.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Very interesting! The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they're thinking strategically rather than just defaulting to rock. This indicates they're considering the payoff matrix and likely had similar reasoning to us - using paper to counter expected rock plays. This player may be more sophisticated than initially assumed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie reveals that both players are thinking defensively and strategically. Now we need to consider what they might expect from us in round 2. They know we both chose paper, so they might:\n1. Expect us to stick with paper (and choose scissors to counter)\n2. Expect us to switch to rock (trying to capitalize on the +3 payoff)\n3. Think we'll try scissors (to counter their potential continued paper play)\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Given that they showed strategic thinking with paper, I'm now more concerned about them anticipating our rock play. If they expect us to go for the high-value rock move, they'll choose paper and we'll lose 3 points. However, if they think we'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So what's our best move considering this new information?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think we should consider scissors now. Here's the reasoning:\n- If they stick with paper (thinking we'll repeat), we win +1\n- If they switch to rock (going for high value), we win +1  \n- If they choose scissors (same reasoning as us), it's a tie\n- The only loss scenario is if they choose rock, but they just showed defensive thinking\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with scissors. The opponent demonstrated strategic, defensive thinking. They're less likely to immediately jump to the high-risk rock move. Scissors gives us good coverage against paper (which they just played) and rock (which they might avoid due to risk).\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Scissors seems reasonable. It has positive expected value against the most likely opponent moves (paper or rock), and limits our downside to just -1 if they happen to choose rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the opponent's strategic paper choice, I'll play scissors to capitalize on their likely continued defensive play or potential rock attempt.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "Excellent! I won that round with scissors beating rock for +1 point. My opponent switched from defensive paper to aggressive rock, which gives me more insight into their strategy. Let me collaborate again.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Fascinating pattern emerging! The opponent went from defensive paper (Round 1) to aggressive rock (Round 2). This suggests they're adapting and trying different strategies rather than sticking to one approach. They might be testing the waters - first being cautious, then going for the high-value move. The question is: what will they do after losing with rock?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent's sequence (paper \u2192 rock) shows they're willing to take risks after a conservative start. Now they just lost with rock, so they might:\n1. Double down on rock (thinking we won't expect it twice)\n2. Switch to paper (defensive response after losing)\n3. Try scissors (completing the cycle through all moves)\n\nGiven they just lost 1 point with rock, they might be more cautious now, or they might stick with rock hoping to catch us with paper.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: We need to consider the opponent's likely emotional state. They just lost after switching to an aggressive strategy. This could make them either more conservative (switch to paper or scissors) or more aggressive (stick with rock for the big +3 payoff). However, rock twice in a row is risky if we anticipate it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: What move gives us the best expected value considering these possibilities?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Let's think through this systematically:\n- If they play rock again (possible but risky for them), we should play paper for +3\n- If they switch to paper (defensive after loss), we should play scissors for +1\n- If they play scissors (neutral choice), we should play rock for +3\n\nPaper seems like a strong choice here because:\n1. It counters rock (which they just played and might repeat)\n2. It gives us the maximum +3 payoff if they do stick with rock\n3. We only lose -1 if they choose scissors\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with paper. After losing with rock, many players either abandon it completely (switch to defensive) or stubbornly stick with it hoping for better luck. Paper covers the \"stick with rock\" scenario beautifully and gives us that juicy +3 points.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Paper is the right play. The risk-reward is excellent: +3 if they repeat rock, +1 if they go to scissors, only -1 if they choose paper. Given their pattern of switching strategies, paper positions us well.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the opponent's switch to aggressive rock play, I'll choose paper to potentially capitalize on a repeated rock move for the high +3 payoff.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Excellent! Another win with paper beating scissors for +1 point. I'm now at +2 points total. The opponent's pattern is becoming clearer. Let me analyze this with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Very revealing pattern! The opponent has now played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in perfect sequence. This suggests one of two things:\n1. They're systematically cycling through each move to test our responses\n2. They're following some kind of rotation strategy, either conscious or subconscious\n\nIf they're cycling, the next logical move would be back to paper (restarting the cycle), or they might break the pattern now that they've tried everything once.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent's sequence (paper, rock, scissors) shows they're methodical rather than random. They've now:\n- Lost 0 points in Round 1 (tie with paper)\n- Lost 1 point in Round 2 (rock vs our scissors)  \n- Lost 1 point in Round 3 (scissors vs our paper)\n\nThey're down -2 points and have tried every move once. If they continue the cycle, paper is next. But they might also adapt since the cycling strategy isn't working for them.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: If they return to paper (continuing the cycle), we should play scissors for +1. But there's also a chance they break the pattern and either:\n- Try rock again (going for the high +3 payoff to recover their losses)\n- Stick with scissors (doubling down on their last move)\n- Choose randomly now that they've tested each option\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their systematic approach and current losing streak, what's our best counter-strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I think scissors is the optimal choice here. Here's why:\n- If they continue the cycle with paper, we win +1\n- If they break pattern and go to rock (trying to recover with +3), we win +1\n- We only lose if they choose scissors (tie) or if they somehow anticipated our logic\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Scissors makes sense. A player who's losing and has been systematic might either continue their pattern (paper next) or switch to the high-value rock move to try to recover. Scissors beats both of these likely scenarios.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Agreed on scissors. The opponent is in a hole (-2 points) and needs to start winning. They'll likely either stick to their pattern (paper) or go aggressive (rock). Scissors covers both scenarios well, with minimal downside risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given the opponent's systematic cycling pattern and their need to recover from -2 points, I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper move or potential rock recovery attempt.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let me strategize with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent's full sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They completed one full cycle (paper, rock, scissors) and then immediately returned to rock. This suggests they're either:\n1. Favoring rock now because of its high +3 potential payoff\n2. Getting frustrated with losing and gravitating toward the \"strongest\" move\n3. Trying to break their predictable pattern by repeating rock\n\nThe fact they went back to rock (instead of continuing to paper) suggests they're prioritizing the high-value move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent is now down -3 points and has lost 3 rounds in a row. They're in a significant hole and desperately need wins. Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3), so there's strong incentive for them to either:\n- Stick with rock again (doubling down)\n- Switch to paper (if they think we'll counter their rock with paper)\n- Try a different approach entirely\n\nHowever, playing rock twice in a row and then a third time would be quite bold.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: The opponent is in desperation mode at -3 points. This psychological pressure might make them either more aggressive (sticking with rock for the big payoff) or more defensive (switching to paper). The key insight is they need big points to catch up, which favors rock plays.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their recent rock preference and desperate situation, what's our optimal response?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper seems like the strong choice here. Here's the analysis:\n- If they stick with rock again (likely given their desperation and recent preference), we get +3 points\n- If they switch to scissors (trying something different), we lose only -1\n- If they choose paper (defensive switch), it's a tie\n\nThe risk-reward strongly favors paper, especially since they seem drawn to rock's high payoff potential.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I strongly agree with paper. A player who's losing badly and just played rock twice in four rounds is likely to either stick with rock (for the big recovery) or expect us to play paper and counter with scissors. But given their desperation, rock seems more likely than scissors.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Paper is the right call. The opponent needs to make up 3+ points and rock is their best path to that. Even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point, but if we're right, we gain 3 and extend our lead significantly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given the opponent's desperation at -3 points and their recent rock preference, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on another rock move for the maximum +3 payoff.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me analyze this with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The full sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. After their initial cycle, they've settled into alternating between rock and scissors (rock, scissors, rock, scissors). This could mean:\n1. They've abandoned paper entirely (maybe because it tied in Round 1)\n2. They're stuck in a rock/scissors alternation pattern\n3. They're avoiding paper because they think we'll counter with scissors\n\nThe opponent is now down -4 points and desperately needs wins. The alternation suggests they might be getting predictable under pressure.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If the alternating pattern continues, the next move should be rock. The opponent has shown:\n- They avoid paper (haven't used it since Round 1)\n- They alternate rock/scissors when under pressure\n- They're in serious deficit and need the +3 payoff that only rock provides\n\nThis makes rock very likely for Round 6, especially since they need big points to recover.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: The opponent is in deep trouble at -4 points. They've lost 4 straight rounds and are showing predictable behavior (rock/scissors alternation). Under this kind of pressure, players often become more predictable, not less. The alternating pattern suggests rock is highly probable next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So if they're likely to play rock next (following the alternation and needing the +3 payoff), what should we do?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper is the obvious choice if we expect rock. It gives us:\n- +3 points if they play rock (as predicted)\n- 0 points if they surprisingly return to paper\n- -1 points if they play scissors instead\n\nGiven their pattern and desperate situation, paper has excellent expected value.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Paper makes perfect sense. The opponent is showing signs of being locked into a predictable alternating pattern under pressure. They need the +3 from rock badly, and they just played scissors, so rock is the logical next move in their alternation.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Definitely paper. Even if we're wrong about the rock prediction, our downside is minimal (-1 or 0), but our upside is huge (+3). Plus, extending our lead to +7 would make their comeback nearly impossible.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on the opponent's rock/scissors alternation pattern and their desperate need for the +3 payoff, I'll play paper to counter their likely rock move.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent has been playing quite well actually. Their sequence (paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock) shows they've been adapting.

The expected value strongly favors paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: So paper to counter their likely rock move?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly. They've established a very clear alternating pattern and just played scissors, so rock should be next. This is our chance to gain +3 points.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Based on their consistent rock-scissors alternation pattern, I'll play paper to counter their likely rock move for +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me collaborate with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Significant development! The opponent's sequence is now: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper. They maintained the rock-scissors alternation for 5 moves after the initial paper, but then returned to paper instead of continuing to rock. This suggests:\n1. They recognized we were predicting their alternation \n2. They're adapting their strategy\n3. They might be returning to a more mixed approach\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern break is telling. They went from predictable alternation back to paper, which suggests they're trying to be less predictable. Now we need to think about what they might do next:\n- Continue with a new pattern starting from paper\n- Return to rock-scissors alternation \n- Play more randomly/unpredictably\n- Try to establish rock (for the +3 payoff) since they just played defensively\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: At this point in the game, both players are at 0 points, so it's essentially a fresh start psychologically. The opponent has shown they can adapt (breaking the alternation), which makes them more dangerous but also potentially more readable if we can figure out their new logic.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that they just played paper (breaking their pattern) and we're tied at 0 points, what's our best next move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is tricky. If they're trying to be unpredictable, any move could come next. However, since they just played paper (a defensive/neutral move), they might be tempted to follow up with rock for the big +3 payoff. Alternatively, they might stick with paper if they think we'll counter with scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think scissors might be the right play here. If they stick with paper (thinking we'll expect rock), we get +1. If they go to rock (trying for the big score), we get +1. We only lose if they choose scissors, which seems less likely after they just broke their pattern to play paper.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Scissors does offer good coverage. It beats paper (+1) and rock (+1), only losing to scissors (-1). Given their recent pattern break to paper, scissors seems like a solid, safe choice with good upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given their pattern break to paper and the psychology of the moment, I'll play scissors to capitalize on their likely paper continuation or potential rock attempt.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let me analyze this latest development with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent's full sequence is now: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. After breaking their alternation with paper, they went to scissors. This could mean:\n1. They're starting a new pattern from paper \u2192 scissors\n2. They're trying to be more unpredictable \n3. They might continue with scissors or move to rock next\n\nThe fact they chose scissors after paper suggests they might be thinking similarly to us - scissors covers both paper and rock well.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: We're both still at 0 points after 9 rounds, which is quite remarkable. The opponent has shown adaptability by breaking patterns. Now that they've played scissors, their next logical moves might be:\n- Rock (for the high +3 payoff, since they've been playing lower-value moves recently)\n- Paper (continuing a potential new pattern)\n- Scissors again (if they think we'll switch)\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Since we're tied at 0-0 and have been playing for many rounds, both players might be getting more aggressive to try to break the deadlock. This psychological pressure might push toward rock (the highest value move) or continued defensive play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their recent moves (paper, scissors) after breaking the alternation pattern, what should we play?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: I'm leaning toward rock. Here's my reasoning:\n- If they continue with scissors (sticking with their last move), we get +3 points\n- If they go to paper (defensive), we lose -3 points  \n- If they choose rock, it's a tie\n\nThe opponent might be drawn to rock themselves (for the big payoff), but they also might stick with scissors since it worked well for coverage in the previous rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Rock seems reasonable. After several ties and low-scoring moves, one player needs to make a bold move to break the deadlock. If they're thinking defensively (continuing scissors), rock gives us the maximum payoff.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Rock is high risk, high reward. But given the game state (tied at 0-0 after many rounds), it might be time to take a calculated risk. The psychological momentum suggests someone needs to make a decisive move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given the prolonged deadlock and their recent pattern changes, I'll take the calculated risk with rock to potentially capitalize on a scissors continuation for +3 points.\n\n[move] Rock"

Let me strategize with my team.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent's sequence is: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors. After breaking their rock-scissors alternation with paper, they've now played scissors twice in a row. This suggests:\n1. They might be settling into a scissors preference (it's been effective)\n2. They could be trying to establish a new pattern\n3. They might switch away from scissors since they've used it consecutively\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent has shown they can break patterns when needed. They went from alternating to playing scissors twice. Since scissors has been working well for them (good coverage, just beat our rock), they might:\n- Continue with scissors (if they think we'll avoid rock now)\n- Switch to rock (going for the +3 payoff)  \n- Return to paper (completing a cycle from their recent paper-scissors-scissors)\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: I'm now down -1 points, so I need to be strategic about recovery. If they stick with scissors again, I should play rock for +3. If they switch to rock (going aggressive), I should play paper for +3. If they choose paper, I should play scissors for +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their recent scissors preference and my need to recover the -1 point deficit, what's our best move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is interesting - if they're getting comfortable with scissors (having played it twice and won once), they might continue. Rock would give us +3 against scissors. However, they might also anticipate this and switch to rock themselves.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think rock is worth the risk. They've played scissors twice in a row and might be getting into a rhythm with it. Even if they switch to paper (costing us -3), the potential +3 gain from beating scissors makes it worthwhile given our deficit.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Agreed on rock. We're behind by 1 point and need to take calculated risks. If they continue their scissors trend, rock gives us the maximum recovery. If they switch to rock (trying the same strategy as us), it's a tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given their recent scissors preference and my need to recover from the -1 deficit, I'll play rock to potentially gain +3 points if they continue with scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

They might have anticipated our rock play (after they used scissors successfully) and chose paper to counter it, but we got there first.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The opponent is showing sophisticated pattern-breaking behavior. They've now:\n- Established rock-scissors alternation\n- Broke it with paper  \n- Played scissors twice\n- Switched to paper (probably anticipating our rock)\n\nThis suggests they're thinking one step ahead, which makes them more dangerous but also potentially more predictable if we can read their meta-strategy.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: I'm now ahead +2 points, which puts me in a good position. The opponent has shown they adapt quickly to patterns, so I should expect them to adjust again after losing with paper. They might:\n- Return to scissors (their recent preference)\n- Try rock (going for the +3 recovery)\n- Stick with paper if they think we'll switch away from rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that they just lost with paper against our rock, and their history of quick adaptation, what should we play next?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: They just lost -3 points with paper, so they're likely behind now.

Let me collaborate with my team on this development.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The opponent's sequence is: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper. Playing paper twice consecutively after losing -3 with it is quite unexpected. This could indicate:\n1. They're doubling down on paper for some strategic reason\n2. They expected us to switch away from rock after winning with it\n3. They might be getting into a defensive mindset\n4. They could be setting up for a pattern we haven't recognized\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Two papers in a row after a big loss is unusual behavior. Most players would either go aggressive (rock for +3 recovery) or return to what was working (scissors). The fact they stuck with paper suggests they might be:\n- Trying to establish paper as their new strategy\n- Expecting us to avoid rock after our big win\n- Setting up for a specific counter-strategy\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: I'm currently at +2 points, so I have a decent lead. The opponent playing paper twice suggests they might continue with it, or they might be ready to switch dramatically. If they stick with paper, I should play scissors for +1. If they switch to rock (finally going for recovery), I should play paper for +3.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their surprising double-paper play and my +2 point lead, what's our optimal move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Scissors seems logical. If they continue their paper trend (third time), we get +1. If they switch to rock (delayed recovery attempt), we get +1. We only lose if they go to scissors, but that seems less likely given they just committed to paper twice.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree with scissors. Their double-paper play suggests either commitment to that strategy or they're building up to something. Either way, scissors covers the most likely scenarios well and keeps building our lead.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Scissors is safe and profitable. With a +2 lead, we don't need to take huge risks. Steady gains with scissors against likely paper plays will maintain our advantage.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Given their unusual double-paper play and my current lead, I'll play scissors to capitalize on a potential third paper or counter a rock recovery attempt.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Responding to our perceived patterns\n3. Returning to scissors since it worked well for them earlier\n\nThe clustering behavior (two papers, then scissors) might indicate they're going to stick with scissors for a bit.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern is becoming more complex.

If they continue clustering, we might see another scissors, or they could switch to a new cluster.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: I'm still at +2 points with a decent lead. The opponent has shown they like to cluster moves recently. If they stick with scissors (continuing the cluster), I should play rock for +3.
