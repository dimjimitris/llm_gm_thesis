Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" I don't have any information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n\n4. In game theory, when facing an opponent with unknown strategy, the optimal approach in rock-paper-scissors is to play randomly with equal probability for each move (1/3 rock, 1/3 paper, 1/3 scissors). This is because:\n   - Any predictable pattern can be exploited\n   - Random play ensures expected value of 0 against any strategy\n   - It's unexploitable\n\n5. However, against human players (especially new ones), there are some common psychological tendencies:\n   - Many people favor rock as their first move (it feels \"strong\")\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen initially\n   - Scissors is moderately chosen\n\n6. Given that this is a fresh player, I'll assume they might follow common human tendencies and potentially choose rock first.\n\n7.
