You and the other player each make a move privately.

Rock and scissors have lower rewards (+1) but also lower penalties (-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might choose.

The risk is that if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is better than the 3 points I'd lose if I chose paper and they chose scissors... wait, let me double-check this.\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- They choose rock: I win +3\n- They choose paper: tie 0  \n- They choose scissors: I lose -1\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- They choose rock: tie 0\n- They choose paper: I lose -3\n- They choose scissors: I win +1\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- They choose rock: I lose -1\n- They choose paper: I win +1\n- They choose scissors: tie 0\n\nPaper has the best upside (+3) and moderate downside (-1).
