But now, I need to figure out what they'll do next.\n\nHmm, new players often stick to rock, paper, scissors in a pattern or might switch after a tie. Since they chose paper last time, maybe they'll switch to something that beats paper, which is scissors. If they think I'll stay with paper, they might go scissors. But if I choose rock, rock beats scissors. Wait, but rock only gives 1 point, while paper gives 3. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they might stay with paper again. Or maybe they'll go back to rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they're new, they might not have a strategy yet. After a tie with paper, they might try a different move randomly. If I choose scissors, it beats paper, but if they switch to rock, I lose. But since they just tied with paper, maybe they'll stick with it again. Or maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll switch to beat their paper. \n\nWait, the highest reward is for paper beating rock. If they think I might go back to rock, they might choose paper again. But since we both did paper last time, maybe they'll switch to scissors to try to beat my possible paper. If I choose rock, then scissors would beat me. Alternatively, if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper if they repeat. But if they switch to scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best bet is to assume they might switch to scissors to counter paper. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But rock only gives 1 point. Alternatively, if they stay with paper, I can choose scissors to beat it. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll choose rock. Then I should choose paper again. Wait, but that's what I did before. Maybe they expect me to repeat. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me think about common new player patterns. After a tie with paper, some might stick to paper, others switch. Maybe the safest move is to go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. If they do, I get +1. If they switch to rock, I lose -1. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, choosing rock could be safer but lower reward. \n\nAlternatively, since paper gives higher points, maybe they'll try to use it again. But since it didn't work last time, they might switch. Hmm. Maybe I should go with rock to counter a possible scissors move. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, perhaps scissors is a better gamble here. Let's go with scissors.\n",

Then, I switched to rock, expecting them to go scissors, and that worked\u2014I won. Now, for the next round, I need to figure out what they might do next.\n\nHmm, after losing with scissors, maybe the opponent will think I'll stick with rock again. But since I just won with rock, they might expect me to stay with it and try to counter with paper. Alternatively, they might switch back to rock, thinking I'll go back to paper. Or maybe they'll try scissors again, hoping I switch to something else. \n\nWait, the opponent is a new player. New players sometimes have patterns. Let's recap their moves so far. First round: paper (tie). Second round: scissors (lost). Now, after losing with scissors, what's a common reaction? Some might switch to rock to beat scissors, but since I just used rock, they might think I'll switch to paper. So they might go scissors again to beat paper. Or maybe they'll go rock to beat my previous scissors, but I didn't play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'm alternating. First paper, then rock, so maybe next I'll go scissors. If they expect scissors, they might play rock. But I need to counter their expected move. \n\nIf they think I'll repeat rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a simpler approach. Since they just lost with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I play paper again, I can beat rock. But wait, in the first round, we both did paper. Then I did rock, they did scissors. Now, if they switch to rock, paper would win. But if they think I'll go back to paper, they might choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors, thinking I might go back to paper. But I just used rock. This is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves so far: paper, scissors. If they follow a pattern, maybe next is rock. So I can play paper to beat rock. But patterns aren't always reliable. \n\nAnother angle: considering the payoffs. When I played rock and they played scissors, I got +1. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play paper to get +3. But if I anticipate that and play scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but scissors vs paper gives me +1. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. Then I should play rock. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. I went paper, then rock. Next could be scissors. But if they expect that, they might counter. Alternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might avoid it and go rock or paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. That seems plausible. But if they think I'm going to play paper again (since I did in the first round), they might choose scissors. So maybe I should play rock again. Wait, but if they expect me to repeat rock, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nHmm, this is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper again, expecting them to switch to rock after their scissors loss. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors. But scissors would lose to rock again. Wait, they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll avoid it. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'm alternating and play scissors next. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But that's what I did last time. If they expect that, they might play paper. \n\nI think the key here is to predict their reaction to the previous loss. Since they played scissors and lost, they might switch to rock. So I should play paper. But if they think I'll do that, they might play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. I played rock last time, so they might play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Without more data, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to cycle through moves. Since I played rock last, next could be paper. But that's not a strict cycle. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, paper gives higher rewards (3 points) when it wins. So maybe the opponent might try to go for that. If they play rock, I can get +3 with paper. But if they play paper again, it's a tie. \n\nWait, in the first round, both played paper. Then I played rock, they played scissors. Now, if they think I'll go back to paper, they might play scissors. So I should play rock again to beat scissors. But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they won't play it again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they play rock. Then I should play paper. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to play paper. But why would they play paper? If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. Then scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to play scissors, they might play rock. Then I lose. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to play paper again. If they switch to rock, I win. If they play paper again, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. But given their last move was scissors, which lost, they might switch. So paper could be a good choice. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might go back to rock. So paper beats rock. \n\nI think I'll go with paper again, hoping they switch to rock after their scissors loss.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for the next round. Let me start by reviewing the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So the opponent started with paper. Then, in the second round, I picked rock, opponent picked scissors. I won. Then third round, I chose paper again, but opponent went with scissors, so I lost. \n\nHmm, the opponent's moves so far have been paper, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Wait, first round both paper. Second round, I picked rock and opponent picked scissors. Third round, I picked paper, opponent picked scissors. So opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves are: first round paper, second round scissors, third round scissors. So after the first tie with paper, they switched to scissors in the second round. Then in the third round, they stuck with scissors again. \n\nBut when I chose paper in the third round, they beat me with scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors? Or maybe they're alternating. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie. \n\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors. So they lost the previous round (since round 1 was a tie, maybe they thought I would stick with paper again, so they went scissors to beat paper. But I went rock, which beats scissors. So maybe they expected me to repeat paper and tried to counter with scissors. \n\nRound 3: I chose paper again, expecting them to switch to rock after losing with scissors. But they chose scissors again, which beat my paper. So they might be sticking with scissors, thinking I might go back to paper. \n\nNow, after losing with paper against their scissors, I need to decide the next move. If they've chosen scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll stick with it again, or maybe they'll switch. \n\nIf they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll go rock to beat scissors. But wait, if they used scissors twice and won once (third round), maybe they'll keep using it. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors. So if I choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I win. But if they expect that and switch to paper, then I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. But if they've been using scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see their moves: paper, scissors, scissors. So after a tie with paper, they tried scissors twice. Maybe they'll try scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, since they beat me with scissors last time, maybe I should choose rock to counter. But if they think I'll do that, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Let's consider the possible options:\n\nIf opponent's last two moves were scissors, scissors, maybe they'll go scissors again. So rock would win. But if they think I'll counter with rock, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to choose scissors (since I lost with paper, maybe I switch to scissors to beat their paper). But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors twice, maybe they'll cycle to rock. So I should choose paper. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they stick with the move that just won. Since they won with scissors last time, they might use it again. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut I need to balance the possible outcomes. Let's look at the points:\n\nRock beats scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3). Paper beats rock (3), loses to scissors (-1). Scissors beat paper (1), lose to rock (-1). \n\nIf I choose rock, possible outcomes:\n- They choose scissors: +1\n- They choose paper: -3\n- They choose rock: 0\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- They choose scissors: -1\n- They choose rock: +3\n- They choose paper: 0\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- They choose paper: +1\n- They choose rock: -1\n- They choose scissors: 0\n\nGiven that they've used scissors twice, maybe the chance they use scissors again is higher. So rock would be good. But if they switch to paper, I lose big. But maybe the risk is worth it. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they go paper, so I should choose scissors to beat paper. But that's a chain of thinking. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they'll switch to paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But that's a higher level of thinking. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're a new player and not thinking too deeply. New players often have patterns. If they used scissors twice, maybe they'll try a different move. Or maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gamble. But considering the points, if I choose rock and they choose scissors, I get +1. If they choose paper, I lose -3. The risk is higher. Alternatively, choosing scissors: if they choose paper, I get +1. If they choose rock, I lose -1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. I chose paper last time, which they beat with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the safest bet is to assume they'll stick with scissors again, so choose rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to choose rock and switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is level 3 thinking. Maybe the opponent is only level 1, just repeating their last move. If they used scissors last time, they might use it again. So rock would be good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. But their last two moves were scissors, scissors. So not alternating. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, choose scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But given that they might anticipate that, maybe they'll switch. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. I chose paper last time, so they might expect me to switch to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll switch from paper to scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, considering they used scissors twice. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, choose scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nWait, the opponent's last two moves were scissors, scissors. If they're a new player, maybe they're sticking with what worked last. Since they won with scissors in the third round, they might do it again. So rock would be the move. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're random. But given the history, it's better to assume a pattern. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. So the move is rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing scissors a lot. They used scissors in the last three rounds where I played rock and won twice, but then when I tried paper, they still used scissors and I lost. Wait, no, let me check the history again.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent chose paper. Tie. Then I chose rock, opponent scissors, I won. Next, I chose paper, opponent scissors, I lost. Then I chose rock again, opponent scissors, I won. Then I tried paper again, opponent scissors again, I lost. Then I went back to rock, opponent scissors, I won. So opponent seems to be sticking with scissors a lot, but maybe they're alternating or trying to predict my moves.\n\nWait, the last few moves: when I played rock, they had scissors. When I switched to paper, they still had scissors. Then back to rock, they scissors again. So maybe they are consistently choosing scissors, perhaps thinking I'll switch to paper again. But why would they keep choosing scissors even after losing to rock multiple times? Maybe they're a bot with a pattern or just really like scissors.\n\nBut if they keep choosing scissors, the optimal move is to play rock every time. But maybe they'll catch on and switch to paper. Wait, but in the rounds where I played paper, they still chose scissors. So even when I tried to predict a switch, they didn't. Hmm. So maybe they're not adapting and just sticking with scissors. But why? Maybe it's a fixed pattern or a new player who doesn't know better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll keep using scissors, then switch. But given the history, they've used scissors four times (rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?), let me recount:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: My rock vs their scissors (win)\nRound 3: My paper vs their scissors (loss)\nRound 4: My rock vs their scissors (win)\nRound 5: My paper vs their scissors (loss)\nRound 6: My rock vs their scissors (win)\nRound 7: My paper vs their scissors (loss)\nRound 8: My rock vs their scissors (win)\n\nWait, the opponent has chosen scissors in rounds 2,3,4,5,6,7,8? That seems like they're always choosing scissors. But that's not possible because in the first round, they chose paper. Then after that, they've been scissors every time. So maybe they have a pattern of scissors except the first round. If that's the case, then playing rock every time would maximize points. But in the rounds where I played paper, they still chose scissors, which is odd. So perhaps the opponent is a bot that's stuck on scissors, or maybe it's a human who's just spamming scissors.\n\nBut if I keep playing rock, I win each time. However, the opponent might notice and switch to paper. But given that they haven't switched yet, maybe they won't. Alternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Wait, but in the rounds where I played paper, they still chose scissors, which beats paper. So even when I tried to vary, they stuck with scissors. That suggests they're not adapting. So the safest bet is to keep playing rock. But maybe they'll expect that and switch to paper. But given their history, they haven't. So perhaps the best move is to continue with rock. However, if I keep winning with rock, they might eventually switch. But since they haven't yet, maybe it's better to stick with rock again. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper, so they play rock, but that's a risk. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has chosen scissors in the last 7 rounds (except the first), maybe they're a bot programmed to choose scissors. In that case, rock every time. But if I keep winning, the game might end, but the user is asking for another round. So perhaps the opponent is a human who's not changing. So the optimal move is rock again. But let's check the previous moves again to be sure.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 3: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 4: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 5: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 6: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 7: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 8: Rock vs scissors (win)\n\nSo every time I play rock, I win. Every time I play paper, I lose. The opponent is consistently choosing scissors. Therefore, the logical move is to play rock again. Unless they start adapting, but there's no sign of that. So the answer should be rock.\n",

In the last round, I played rock, expecting them to stick with scissors, but they also chose rock, resulting in a tie. Hmm. So maybe they noticed I was countering their scissors with rock and decided to switch to rock themselves. Now, after the tie with rock, what would they do next?\n\nIf they were using scissors and then switched to rock after I countered, maybe they'll try to predict my next move. Since I played rock twice in a row (once winning, once tying), they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their potential rock.

Maybe I should play paper to counter a possible rock again, but that's risky if they go back to scissors. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. Wait, if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper after the tie with rock, so they'll play scissors. In that case, I should play rock again. But they might anticipate that. This is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot except the last move, maybe they're more likely to go back to scissors.

But if they play rock again, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But given their history, they might switch back to scissors. Alternatively, play scissors to counter paper. \n\nWait, let's think about their possible thought process. They just tied with rock. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they play scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might try to break the pattern by going back to scissors. Since they used scissors so much before, maybe they'll revert. In that case, rock would be good. \n\nBut given that they just tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they go back to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. They used scissors, then rock, so next might be paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. Their moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock.

They might go back to scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again. If they go back to scissors, I win. If they stay with rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. But considering they just tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nHmm. I'm torn. Maybe the best move is to play rock again, hoping they revert to scissors. \n\nBut in the last round, they played rock, so maybe they're trying to counter my rock. If I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nThis is really tricky.

So if they beat my rock with paper, they might think I'll play scissors next, so they switch to rock. Therefore, if I play paper, I can beat their rock.\n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper, it's a tie. So playing paper here could either tie or win, but not lose.

But this is all speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they expect that and play rock, I lose. It's a risk. But given that they just used paper, maybe they'll stick with it again. If I play scissors, I can win. If they switch to rock, I lose. It's a 50-50 chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to break the pattern. Since they used paper once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. But that's not clear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, hoping they stay on paper. But given that they just beat me with paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors and switch to rock. So maybe I should play paper instead to counter their expected rock.\n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. But considering the opponent's recent switch to paper after a long streak of scissors, they might be varying their strategy. To counter that, playing paper could be safer, as it either ties or beats their possible rock, but loses to scissors. Alternatively, scissors beats paper but loses to rock.\n\nHmm.

They used scissors multiple times, then switched to paper when I was on rock, then scissors again. It seems like they might be alternating between countering my previous move. When I played rock, they went paper. When I played paper, they went scissors. So maybe they're following a pattern of choosing the move that beats my last move.\n\nIf that's the case, then my last move was paper, which they countered with scissors. So next, they might expect me to play scissors (to beat their scissors), so they would play rock to counter scissors. If I play paper again, it would beat rock. But wait, that's a bit of a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not following a strict pattern but reacting to my recent changes. Since I just played paper and lost, they might think I'll switch to rock or scissors. If I play scissors now, it would beat their expected paper, but if they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors because it's been working. Let's check the last few moves:\n\n- They played scissors and I played rock, I won.\n- Then they played paper, I played rock, they won.\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors, they won.\n- Then I played rock, they played paper, they won.\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors again.\n\nWait, no, the last few moves were:\n\nAfter several rounds where I played rock and they played scissors, they switched to paper when I kept playing rock. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they used paper again. Then when I tried paper again, they used scissors again. So their moves seem to be: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors? Or maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors when I switch.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to break the cycle. If they expect me to play paper again (since I just did and lost), they might play scissors again. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But how confident am I that they'll play paper?\n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my paper with scissors, maybe they'll stick with scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they might anticipate that and switch to paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize moves, but since we're trying to predict each other, maybe I need to detect a pattern. Let's see:\n\nTheir recent moves: scissors (win), paper (win), scissors (win), paper (win), scissors (win). Wait, no, the results were:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper, tie.\n- Round 2: I played rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Round 3: I paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Round 4: I rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Round 5: I rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Then I kept playing rock, they switched to paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Then I played rock, they paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Then I played rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Then I played rock, they paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is cycling through moves. Let me list their moves based on the rounds:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n6. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n8.

Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n\nHmm, the opponent's moves after the initial rounds seem to be alternating between scissors and paper. After I played rock multiple times, they switched to paper. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they used paper again. Then when I tried paper again, they used scissors. So the pattern might be scissors, paper, scissors, paper, etc., whenever I switch my moves.\n\nIf that's the case, then after they played scissors (when I played paper and lost), the next move would be paper. So if I play scissors now, I can beat their expected paper. But if they break the pattern and play scissors again, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. But they haven't played rock much except in the early rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors. If I played rock last time, they play paper. If I played scissors, they play rock. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move was paper. If they follow the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would play scissors. Which they did. Then I played rock, so they would play paper. Which they did. Then I played paper again, so they play scissors again. So if I play rock now, they would play paper. But if I play scissors, they would play rock. Wait, no. If they are following \"beat previous move\", then:\n\nMy last move was paper. They played scissors to beat it. Now, if I play scissors, they would play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors.\n\nBut in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. If I now play scissors, they would play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors.\n\nSo if I want to beat their expected move, which would be rock if I play scissors, then I should play paper. But if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, then my current move should be the one that beats their expected move.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to model it:\n\nAssuming opponent's strategy is to beat my last move:\n\n- If I last played paper, they play scissors.\n- If I last played scissors, they play rock.\n- If I last played rock, they play paper.\n\nSo, my last move was paper. Therefore, they will play scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock. But in the previous round, when I played paper, they did play scissors. So if I follow this logic, I should play rock now. But in the last round where I played paper, they played scissors, so if I now play rock, I would beat their expected scissors. But wait, if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, then they would play scissors again because my last move was paper. So rock would win. But in the previous round, when I played paper, they played scissors. If I now play rock, I win. But in the round before that, when I played rock, they played paper, which beat me. So if I play rock now, expecting them to play scissors, but if they instead follow the same pattern, they might play paper again. Wait, no. If their strategy is to beat my last move, then:\n\nMy last move was paper, so they play scissors. If I now play rock, their next move would be to beat rock, which is paper. So if I play rock now, they would play paper next time. But right now, if I play rock, expecting them to play scissors (based on my last move being paper), but if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would have played scissors in response to my paper. So in the current round, if I play rock, I would beat their scissors. But wait, the last round was:\n\nI played paper, they played scissors (they beat my paper). Now, if I play rock, expecting them to play scissors again (if they stick to the same move), but if they follow the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would look at my last move (paper) and play scissors again. So rock would win. But if they instead are changing their strategy, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they play paper. It's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is not following a strict pattern but is adapting based on my moves. Since I've been switching between rock and paper, they might expect me to switch again. If I played paper last time and lost, maybe they think I'll switch to rock. So they would play paper to beat rock. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to try to break the cycle. Since they've been beating me with scissors when I play paper, and paper when I play rock, maybe I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they are continuing to play scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoff matrix, paper gives higher points (3) when it wins, but also higher penalties (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors give +1/-1. Since the opponent has been using scissors and paper, maybe I should focus on maximizing points when possible. But given the uncertainty, maybe sticking with a balanced approach.\n\nWait, in the last round, I played paper and they played scissors. If I now play rock, which beats scissors, I can win. But will they play scissors again? They might if they think I'll stick with paper. Or they might switch to paper expecting me to play rock. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my paper with scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock, so they'll play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. This is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're on a scissors streak. They played scissors the last two times I played paper. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've used scissors multiple times, maybe they'll stick with it. So playing rock might be safe. But they might anticipate that.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to vary my moves unpredictably. For example, after playing paper and losing, switch to scissors. If they expect rock, they play paper, and I can beat it with scissors. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my last move, I can try to counter their expected counter. For example, if I played paper last time, they played scissors. Now, I can play rock to beat their expected scissors. But if they instead play paper, I lose. But if they follow the same pattern, rock would win.\n\nGiven that they've been consistently countering my last move, maybe this is the best approach. So:\n\nLast move: I played paper, they played scissors.\n\nNext move: If they counter my last move (paper) with scissors again, I play rock. If they switch to countering my expected rock, they play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But this is a double-bluff.\n\nAlternatively, if they expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, they play paper. So I play scissors to beat paper. But this requires predicting two steps ahead.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their recent history, they might stick with scissors. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching between scissors and paper recently. In the last few rounds, when I kept playing rock, they started using paper to counter me, which worked for them. Then when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors. Now, after I went back to rock, they used scissors again.\n\nHmm, so there's a pattern here. When I stick with rock too long, they switch to paper. When I switch to paper, they go to scissors. Then when I go back to rock, they use scissors again. It seems like they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. \n\nWait, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. Let me check the history. The last few moves were: they played paper (beating my rock), then scissors (beating my paper), then scissors again (losing to my rock). So after their paper win, they tried scissors again, which I countered with rock. \n\nIf they keep alternating, maybe after scissors, they might go back to paper or rock. But since they just lost with scissors, they might switch. If they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper again. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat paper. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch from rock to something else, they might stay with paper. \n\nBut I need to consider the points. Paper beats rock for +3, which is a bigger reward. If I can predict their paper, playing scissors would give me +1. But if they switch back to rock, scissors would lose. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. So maybe I should play paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to switch from rock, they might play scissors again, expecting me to choose paper. But that's getting complicated. Maybe the opponent is trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable. \n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper to counter a potential rock again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. \n\nWait, the last time they won was with paper, then scissors. After that, they lost with scissors. So maybe they're trying to cycle through moves. If they were on scissors and lost, they might go back to paper. Or maybe they'll try rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. But after a loss, they might change. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nI need to maximize my points. If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3. If they play scissors, I lose -1. If I play rock and they play scissors, I get +1. If they play paper, I lose -3. \n\nConsidering the risk-reward, maybe paper is a good choice if I think they'll switch to rock. But if they stay with scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, rock is safe if they go back to scissors. \n\nBut given their recent switch to paper after a series of scissors, maybe they're alternating. So after scissors, they might go to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they go to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors again. In that case, rock would still win. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their recent moves:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n2.

But then they started using paper to counter my rock, which made me lose. Now, after I lost with rock against their paper, I need to adjust.\n\nHmm, if they just beat me with paper, maybe they expect me to switch to paper to counter their paper (since paper vs paper is a tie). Or maybe they'll switch back to scissors, thinking I might go back to rock. Wait, but if I play scissors now, scissors beats paper. But if they think I'm going to play scissors, they might play rock. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors. Let's look at the pattern. The last few moves: they used paper, then scissors, then rock, then scissors again. Wait, no, let me check the history. \n\nIn the previous rounds, after several wins with rock against their scissors, they switched to paper and beat my rock. Then I tried paper, but they used scissors. Then I went back to rock and won again. Then they used paper again. So it seems like when I stick with rock, they sometimes switch to paper. But they also sometimes go back to scissors. \n\nSo maybe they're trying to predict my moves. If I keep using rock, they might use paper again. To counter that, I should use scissors. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might use rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with paper now. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can beat their rock if they expect me to play scissors. But they might also play scissors again. \n\nWait, the last move they made was paper, which beat my rock. Now, what's the best response? If they think I'll switch from rock to something else, maybe they'll stay with paper expecting me to play paper (to tie) or scissors (which they can beat with rock). Or they might switch to scissors to beat paper. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to vary my strategy. Since they used paper last time, maybe they'll stick with it, so I should play scissors. But if they switch back to scissors, then scissors beats my scissors. Wait, no, scissors vs scissors is a tie. So if I play scissors, the worst case is a tie if they also play scissors, or I lose if they play rock. But if they play paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, if I play paper, I can beat rock if they switch to that, but lose to scissors. \n\nGiven that they just used paper, maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to play scissors. So if I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So scissors would be good. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe I should try to counter their last move. Since they played paper, I should play scissors. Let's go with that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching between scissors, paper, and rock. They used paper last time to beat my rock, so I tried scissors to counter, but they also chose scissors, leading to a tie. Now I need to figure out their next move.\n\nHmm, after a tie with scissors, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I might switch. Or maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to stay with scissors. Alternatively, they might go back to paper if they think I'll anticipate scissors again. \n\nWait, their pattern seems a bit unpredictable. They used scissors a lot initially, then switched to paper when I kept using rock. After that, when I tried scissors, they also chose scissors. It's possible they're trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable. \n\nIf they used scissors last time and tied, they might think I'll stay with scissors or switch to rock. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. Scissors would tie again if they repeat. \n\nSince they just tied with scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my potential scissors. If I choose paper, I can beat their possible rock. But if they stay with scissors, paper would lose. Alternatively, if they go back to paper, I need scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their recent moves. Let's recap:\n\n- They used scissors multiple times, leading me to use rock.\n- Then they switched to paper to counter my rock.\n- I tried scissors, they also used scissors (tie).\n- Now, after the tie, what's next?\n\nIf they were trying to counter my previous move, after I used scissors (which tied with their scissors), they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper again. But if they think I'll stay with scissors, they might choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might go back to their original pattern of using scissors. But given that they just used scissors and tied, maybe they'll try something else. \n\nI need to balance between these possibilities. Choosing paper could counter a potential rock, which they might use if they expect me to switch from scissors to rock. But if they stick with scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, choosing rock could beat scissors if they go back, but lose to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper again, thinking I might expect them to avoid scissors after the tie. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they choose rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Considering their tendency to switch after a loss or tie, maybe they'll go back to paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they choose rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again, leading to another tie. But that's less likely. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to vary my own moves to avoid being predictable. Since I just used scissors and tied, maybe switch to rock to counter a possible scissors again. But they might anticipate that and use paper. \n\nAlternatively, use paper to counter a possible rock. But if they use scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the safest bet is to go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock after the tie. If they do, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. If they choose paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they used paper before to counter my rock, maybe they'll try that again. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nWait, their last two moves were paper and scissors. They used paper to beat my rock, then scissors to tie with my scissors. Maybe they're cycling through moves. If they followed paper with scissors, maybe next is rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper. \n\nBut that's assuming a cycle, which might not be the case. Alternatively, they might be random. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose paper, expecting them to switch to rock after the scissors tie. If they do, I win. If they choose scissors again, I lose. If they choose paper, tie. \n\nAlternatively, stick with scissors, expecting them to stay. But that led to a tie last time. \n\nAlternatively, switch to rock, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nThis is tough. Maybe I should go with paper as a middle ground. Let's try that.\n",

If that's the case, after they played scissors last time (when I played paper and lost), the next move should be paper. But if they're alternating, then after scissors comes paper, then scissors again. Wait, the last move was scissors (I played paper and lost), so next would be paper. If I play scissors to beat paper, but they might expect that and play rock. Alternatively, if they stick to the pattern, they'll play paper, so I should play scissors. But if they break the pattern, maybe they play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed I tend to play rock after losing with paper, so they might expect rock and play paper again. To counter that, I could play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. This is a mind game. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to go back to rock, expecting they might play scissors again, but considering they just beat my paper with scissors, maybe they'll stick with scissors. Alternatively, they might switch to rock expecting me to play scissors. It's tricky. But since they've used scissors a lot, maybe rock is still a viable choice.

When I play rock, I usually win against their scissors, but sometimes they switch to paper and beat me. Then when I try to counter paper with scissors, they might go back to rock.

Or maybe they have a pattern of switching after a loss.\n\nWait, when they beat me with paper, I tried scissors next, but they stayed with scissors, leading to a tie. Then I played paper expecting rock, but they used scissors again. So maybe they're sticking with scissors unless they lose, then they switch. But it's inconsistent.\n\nI need to predict their next move. If they used scissors last time and I beat them with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. But if they notice I keep using rock, they might stick with paper. Alternatively, they might go back to scissors thinking I'll switch to something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern. Let's look at the history:\n\n- They played scissors multiple times, then paper once, then scissors again, then rock once, then scissors again. It's a bit random, but scissors is their most common move.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best strategy is to play rock most of the time, but occasionally switch to paper if they start using paper more. But since they sometimes switch to paper after a loss, maybe after I win with rock, they'll switch to paper, so I should counter with scissors. But when I tried that, they used rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my rock by switching to paper, so I should use scissors to beat their paper. But when I used scissors, they tied with scissors. This is tricky.\n\nWait, the last time they beat me with paper, I switched to scissors, which tied. Then I went back to rock and won. Maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors. If they used scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should use scissors. But if they stick with scissors, I should use rock. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they tend to revert to scissors, maybe I should stick with rock most of the time, accepting that sometimes they'll switch to paper and beat me, but overall, the majority of their moves are scissors, so rock gives me more wins. The points from rock beating scissors (1 point) might outweigh the losses when they use paper (-3 points). Let's see:\n\nIf they use scissors 70% of the time and paper 30%, then:\n\nRock: 0.7*1 + 0.3*(-3) = 0.7 - 0.9 = -0.2\n\nPaper: 0.7*(-1) + 0.3*3 = -0.7 + 0.9 = 0.2\n\nScissors: 0.7*0 + 0.3*(-1) = -0.3\n\nSo if they use scissors 70% and paper 30%, paper would be better. But if they use scissors more, like 80%, then:\n\nRock: 0.8*1 + 0.2*(-3) = 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.2\n\nPaper: 0.8*(-1) + 0.2*3 = -0.8 + 0.6 = -0.2\n\nSo depending on their frequency, the optimal move changes. Since in the game history, they used scissors a lot, maybe around 70-80%, so rock might still be better. But when they do switch to paper, the penalty is higher. Alternatively, maybe I should switch to paper to counter their possible paper after a loss. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost to my rock (they played scissors), maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But last time I tried that after a rock win, they played scissors again, leading to a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not adapting and just keep using scissors most of the time. In that case, rock is still the best. But after a few losses, they might switch. Since the last round they lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, I tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my moves to avoid being predictable. If I keep playing rock, they might catch on and start using paper more. So maybe I should throw in a paper or scissors occasionally. But given that they tend to use scissors a lot, maybe rock is still the best bet, even with the occasional loss to paper.\n\nBut given the recent history: they used scissors, I beat them with rock. Then they used paper, beat me. Then I used scissors, tied. Then rock again, won. Then they used paper again. So maybe after a loss with scissors, they switch to paper. Then after a loss with paper, they switch to rock? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors -> paper -> scissors -> paper. But it's hard to tell with limited data.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to continue with rock, accepting that sometimes they'll switch to paper, but overall, the majority of their moves are scissors. Alternatively, switch to paper to counter their possible switch to paper after a loss. But that's risky if they stick with scissors.\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. Considering the previous pattern, after a loss with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper. So maybe scissors is a good move here.\n\nWait, in the last round, after I won with rock (they had scissors), they switched to paper. Then I played scissors, which tied when they used scissors again. Then I played rock and won. So maybe after a loss with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper, but not consistently. It's inconsistent.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to stick with rock, as it has given the most consistent wins, even with occasional losses. Alternatively, try to predict their switch to paper and counter with scissors. But without a clear pattern, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. Since they might expect me to keep using rock, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they don't switch, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, and sometimes paper, maybe the best move is to play paper. Because paper beats rock (if they switch to rock) and loses to scissors (which they might not use as much now). Wait, no. If they used scissors a lot, paper loses to scissors. So that's bad.\n\nWait, the payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (1), loses to paper (-3)\n- Paper beats rock (3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors beats paper (1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nIf the opponent is using scissors most of the time, then:\n\n- Rock gives +1 most of the time, but -3 occasionally\n- Paper gives -1 most of the time, +3 occasionally\n- Scissors gives 0 most of the time (if they use scissors), +1 if they use paper, -1 if they use rock\n\nSo if scissors is their most common move, rock is the best choice, even with the risk of -3. Because the frequency of scissors is higher, the expected value might still be positive.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with rock again.\n",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The original response had a move message with an explanation, but maybe the formatting was off. The correction says that the move message should start with [move], then the explanation in parentheses, and then the move. Also, they emphasized not using markdown and ensuring the structure is correct.\n\nIn the previous attempt, I included the [move] tag in the reasoning, which might have been the issue. The user wants the move message to be separate from the reasoning. So, I need to make sure that the [move] line is correctly formatted without any extra tags or markdown. The explanation should be in parentheses right after the [move] tag, followed by the move choice. \n\nThe user's example shows that the steps are part of the thinking process, and the final decision is the move. So, I should structure my response with the steps first, then the final move message. Let me check the game rules again. The new player might choose rock, so paper is a good choice because it beats rock for +3 points. If they pick scissors, I lose -1, which is a lower risk. That reasoning makes sense. \n\nI need to present the steps as part of the thought process and then the move message correctly formatted. The key is to separate the thinking steps from the actual move command. Let me structure it like the example provided, with steps leading to the final decision, then the move message following the required format. No markdown, just plain text with the [move] line properly formatted.\n",

The assistant included the [move] tag in the reasoning part, which isn't allowed. The correct way is to have the [move] tag only in the actual move message, not in the thinking process. The user wants the assistant to resend the corrected message without indicating that a correction was made. \n\nLooking at the example given, the assistant's first response had the [move] tag followed by the explanation and the move. But according to the correction, the explanation should be in parentheses right after the [move] tag, then the move. Also, the example shows that the move is on the same line as the [move] tag and explanation. The assistant's previous response had the move on a new line, which might have been the error.\n\nSo the correct format should be: [move] (Explanation here) Paper. All in one line, without any markdown. The assistant needs to adjust the previous response to fit this format. The reasoning part (the thinking process) shouldn't include the [move] tag at all. The actual move message should be properly formatted with the tag, explanation in parentheses, and the move, all in one line.\n",

But this is getting a bit too into their head. \n\nAlternatively, since they're a new player, maybe they'll try to counter the last move. Since I played rock and won, they might expect me to play rock again and thus choose paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll just alternate moves. They played paper, then scissors, so maybe next they'll play rock. If that's the case, I should play paper. But there's no clear pattern yet. \n\nConsidering the possible options, maybe the safest bet is to play scissors. If they switch to paper expecting me to stay with rock, scissors would win. If they play rock, I lose. But given that they just lost with scissors, maybe they'll go back to rock. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again. \n\nWait, another angle: the opponent might be trying to mirror my previous move. I played rock last time, so they might play rock this time, leading to a tie. But that's not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. If I play paper, paper beats rock. So if I expect them to switch to rock, I should play paper. But if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors again. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe I should look for a pattern. The opponent's moves so far: first paper, then scissors. If they follow a pattern, maybe next is rock. So I should play paper. But that's assuming a linear progression. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might revert to their initial move, which was paper. But in the first round, they played paper, then scissors. If they go back to paper, then I should play scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to counter their possible reaction to my last move. Since I played rock and won, they might expect me to play rock again and thus choose paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors, so I should play rock again. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nGiven that they're a new player, perhaps they're more likely to switch to a move that beats their last losing move. Since scissors lost to rock, they might choose rock to beat scissors. If I play paper, I can beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I won with rock, I'll stick with it, so they'll play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nHmm. I think the most probable move for them is either paper (to beat my previous rock) or rock (to counter a possible scissors from me). If I play scissors, I can beat paper but lose to rock. If I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. If I play rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the optimal choice is to play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. But considering their previous two moves were paper and scissors, maybe they'll cycle to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost with scissors, they might try to go back to a safer move like rock. So I'll play paper to beat rock. \n\nI think I'll go with paper this round.\n",

They might have expected me to stick with paper, so they went scissors to beat it.

Wait, no. Wait, first round was both paper. Then opponent's second move was scissors (since I won with rock). Third round, opponent chose scissors again, which beat my paper. So their moves are paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nSo after a tie with paper, they went scissors twice. Maybe they're sticking with scissors? Or maybe they have a pattern. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nIf they used scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch to rock next, thinking I might go back to scissors to beat their expected paper. Or maybe they'll stick with scissors again. Alternatively, they might try to counter what I did last. I chose paper last time and lost, so maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their possible paper. But they just beat my paper with scissors, so maybe they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me break it down. The opponent's moves so far:\n\nRound 1: Paper (tie)\nRound 2: Scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 3: Scissors (beat my paper)\n\nSo they went from paper to scissors, then scissors again. Maybe they're trying to exploit a pattern. Since they beat me with scissors last time, they might expect me to counter with rock. If they think I'll choose rock, they might go paper to beat it. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again (since I lost once, maybe I try to repeat), they might go scissors again.

Let's see my moves:\n\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Rock\nRound 3: Paper\n\nSo my moves are paper, rock, paper. If the opponent is trying to predict my next move based on my history, they might notice that I alternated between paper and rock, then back to paper. Maybe they think I'll switch to rock again. If that's the case, they might choose paper to beat rock. But if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they might go scissors again. But they already did that twice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my last move. My last move was paper, which they beat with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might go paper. But if I instead choose scissors again, expecting their paper, that would beat paper. Wait, but scissors beats paper. Wait, no: scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors.\n\nWait, the scoring is:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser.\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser.\n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser.\n\nSo the opponent might be trying to maximize their points. If they notice that when they play scissors, they either lose to rock (if I play rock) or win against paper (if I play paper). But in the last round, they won by playing scissors against my paper. So maybe they'll stick with scissors again, hoping I play paper again. But I just lost with paper, so maybe I'll switch. If I switch to rock, I can beat scissors. But if they expect that, they might switch to paper to beat my rock. But that would give them +3 points, which is a bigger reward. So maybe they're incentivized to go for paper if they think I'll play rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to vary their moves. Let's think about possible strategies. If the opponent has played scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. But it's possible they're sticking with scissors again. So what's the best move here?\n\nIf I play rock, and they play scissors again, I win +1. If they switch to paper, I lose -3. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. If I play paper, and they play scissors again, I lose -1. If they switch to rock, I win +3. If they play paper, tie. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, tie. If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play paper, I win +1.\n\nSo the possible outcomes depend on their next move. Since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But it's hard to predict. Maybe I should assume they'll switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, where they play what beat me last time. Last time, they beat me with scissors (against my paper). So maybe they'll play scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So it's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, considering the scoring, paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it beats rock. So maybe the opponent is trying to set up for that. But in the last two rounds, they played scissors. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: since I lost the last round by playing paper, maybe the opponent expects me to avoid paper and switch to rock or scissors. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, they get +3. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, they get +1. If I choose paper again, and they choose scissors again, they get +1. So the opponent might prefer to play paper if they think I'll play rock, or scissors if they think I'll play paper again.\n\nBut given that they've played scissors twice, maybe they're sticking with it. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, and they play scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves: paper, scissors, scissors. So after a tie with paper, they went scissors twice. Maybe they're favoring scissors now. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to play rock now, so they'll play paper. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they think I'll do that, they might play rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since this is a limited number of rounds, maybe there's a pattern to exploit. Let's see. If the opponent played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, if I play rock and they play scissors, I get +1. If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3. If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1. The highest reward is from paper beating rock. But the opponent's last two moves were scissors. So maybe they're not going to play rock. If they play scissors again, rock is safe. If they switch to paper, I lose. But how likely is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper, which they beat with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might play paper. So if I play rock, they play paper, I lose. If I play scissors, they might play paper again, and I win. If I play paper again, they might play scissors again, and I lose.\n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll stick with scissors again, so I play rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they expect me to play rock, they'll play paper, so I should play scissors. But then if they play scissors, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me twice with scissors (once in round 3), maybe they'll continue. So I should play rock. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. In that case, I should play scissors. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. But given the opponent's recent moves, they've used scissors twice. Maybe they'll switch, but maybe not. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, they might think I'll play rock and counter with paper. So perhaps I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, if I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors, tie. If I play rock and they play scissors, +1. If they play paper, -3. If they play rock, tie. The risk of playing rock is higher (-3) if they switch to paper. The risk of playing scissors is lower (-1 if they play rock). Maybe scissors is safer. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is alternating between moves. Their moves were paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they'll play rock next. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they play scissors again, I lose. Hmm.\n\nThis is really a guess. But given that they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock. But without knowing, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should counter their most common move. They've played scissors twice and paper once. So scissors is more common. To counter scissors, I should play rock. But if they switch, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me with scissors twice (once in round 3), maybe they'll try it again. So I should play rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering that when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they played scissors. Wait, no. Let me check the history again:\n\nRound 1: Both paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent scissors. I won.\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent scissors. I lost.\n\nSo opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nSo in round 2, when I played rock, they played scissors. In round 3, when I played paper, they played scissors again. So they might be sticking with scissors regardless of my move. If that's the case, then playing rock again would beat scissors. But they might expect that and switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of playing scissors after a loss. In round 2, they lost, then in round 3, they played scissors again. Wait, no. Round 2: they lost (opponent played scissors, I played rock). Then in round 3, they played scissors again and won. So after a loss, they stuck with scissors and won. Maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat it. But if they switch, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. Since they won with scissors in round 3, they might play scissors again. So I should play rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Without more data, it's hard to tell. However, given the opponent's recent moves, playing scissors twice, maybe they'll continue. So I'll go with rock to beat scissors.\n",

Let me start by reviewing the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So the opponent started with paper. Then, in the second round, I picked rock, opponent picked scissors. I won. Then third round, I chose paper again, but opponent went with scissors, so I lost. \n\nHmm, the opponent's moves so far: paper, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Wait, first round both paper. Second round, opponent chose scissors (since I picked rock and won). Third round, opponent chose scissors again, which beat my paper. So their moves are paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nNow, trying to predict their next move. After a loss with scissors, maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they're sticking with scissors. Let's think about common patterns. People often switch after a loss. So after I lost with paper against their scissors, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their scissors. But if they think that, they might go rock to beat my scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper again, they might stick with scissors. \n\nWait, but in the third round, they beat my paper with scissors. So they might think I'll switch to scissors next. If they expect me to switch to scissors, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'm going to counter their scissors with rock, they might stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Their moves were paper, scissors, scissors. Maybe they'll repeat scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, then my rock would tie. Or if they switch to paper, my rock would lose. \n\nWait, the payoffs: rock beats scissors (1 point), paper beats rock (3 points), scissors beat paper (1 point). So if I can predict their move, I should choose the one that gives me the highest reward. For example, if I think they'll play rock, choosing paper gives +3. If I think scissors, rock gives +1. \n\nBut given their recent move was scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. Let's think about their possible reasoning. They won the last round with scissors against my paper. They might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their scissors. So they might go rock to beat my scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again (since I lost once, maybe I try again), they might stick with scissors. But that's risky for them because if I switch to rock, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. Let's see: their moves were paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to stick with scissors. If they do scissors again, I should play rock. But if they switch to rock, I should play paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a counter to their possible next move. If they played scissors twice, maybe they'll go for rock next. So I should play paper. But if they stick with scissors, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. They won with scissors last time, so they might play scissors again. But that's two times in a row. If they do, rock would win. \n\nBut since they just won with scissors, maybe they expect me to counter with rock. So they might switch to paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model their possible thought process. \n\nOpponent's history:\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (lost to my rock)\nRound 3: scissors (beat my paper)\n\nSo in round 3, they won with scissors. They might think that since I played paper twice (round 1 and 3), I might switch. If they think I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, they might play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they might play scissors again. But I just lost with paper, so maybe I'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors. But since they already did that, maybe they'll play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to randomize. But since it's a new player, maybe they have a pattern. \n\nAnother angle: considering the points. When they beat me with scissors, they got +1. If they play scissors again and I play rock, they lose. But if they switch to rock, they might get a higher reward if I play scissors. \n\nHmm. I'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors, expecting them to play paper. But that's a gamble. \n\nWait, the highest reward is for paper beating rock (+3). If I can predict rock, that's best. But if they're likely to play rock, then paper is good. But how likely is that? \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock would be good. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe I should use a mixed strategy. But since I'm supposed to choose one move, I need to make the best guess. \n\nGiven that they've played scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they stay with scissors, I should play rock. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard. Maybe the best bet is to assume they'll switch from scissors to rock, so I play paper. Or assume they stay with scissors, play rock. \n\nAlternatively, considering that they just won with scissors, they might think I'll counter with rock, so they switch to paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a loop. Maybe I should go with the move that covers the most possibilities. For example, if I play rock, I can beat scissors (which they might repeat) but lose to paper. If I play paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. If I play scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock. \n\nGiven their last two moves were scissors, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, paper is good. If they switch to paper, scissors is good. If they stay with scissors, rock is good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll think I'm going to play rock to counter their scissors, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Maybe the best approach is to counter their most recent move. They played scissors last time, so I play rock. But if they think that, they play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me with scissors, maybe I should play rock to counter. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played paper and lost. So maybe they expect me to switch to rock. If they expect rock, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut that's a chain of reasoning. Let me outline:\n\n- Last move: I played paper, they played scissors (they won).\n- They might think I'll switch from paper to rock (to beat scissors).\n- If they think I'll play rock, they'll play paper to beat it.\n- So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper again, they'll play scissors again. Then I should play rock. \n\nBut since I just lost with paper, it's more likely I'll switch. So they might anticipate that and counter. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to randomize moves, but since we're dealing with a human opponent, patterns might emerge. \n\nGiven that the opponent is a new player, they might be more likely to switch after a win. So after winning with scissors, they might think I'll counter with rock, so they switch to paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with scissors, thinking I'll stay with paper. But I just lost with paper, so that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, they might not think that deeply and just repeat scissors. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. But considering that they just won with scissors, and new players often change their move after a win (to avoid being predictable), maybe they'll switch to paper. If so, scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might switch to rock to counter my expected switch to scissors. \n\nWait, if I lost with paper, maybe I'll switch to scissors to beat their scissors. But scissors vs scissors is a tie. Or switch to rock to beat their scissors. \n\nIf they think I'll switch to rock, they'll play paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll go for a third time. So rock would be safe. \n\nBut in reality, people rarely play the same move three times in a row. So they might switch. \n\nIf they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to paper, scissors beats it. \n\nBut which is more likely? Maybe they switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might switch to rock, thinking I'll play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of guessing. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to switch to rock after their scissors. \n\nBut in the previous round, they played scissors. If they switch to rock, paper beats it. If they switch to paper, scissors beats it. If they stay with scissors, rock beats it. \n\nAlternatively, since I lost with paper, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock, expecting them to stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors. If they expect me to switch from paper to rock, they play paper, and scissors beats paper. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play rock. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, tie. \n\nHmm. Considering the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- They play rock: I lose (-1)\n- They play paper: I win (+1)\n- They play scissors: tie (0)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- They play rock: tie\n- They play paper: I lose (-3)\n- They play scissors: I win (+1)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- They play rock: I win (+3)\n- They play paper: tie\n- They play scissors: I lose (-1)\n\nThe potential rewards and risks vary. Playing paper has the highest reward (+3) if they play rock, but also a penalty (-1) if they play scissors. Rock has a +1 if they play scissors, but -3 if they play paper. Scissors has +1 if they play paper, -1 if rock. \n\nGiven that they've played scissors twice, maybe they're less likely to play it again. So perhaps they'll switch to rock or paper. \n\nIf they switch to rock, paper is best. If they switch to paper, scissors is best. \n\nBut which is more likely? New players often switch after a win. Since they just won with scissors, they might think to switch. But to what? \n\nIf they think I'll play rock to counter scissors, they'll play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nIf they think I'll play scissors to counter their scissors (tie), they might stay with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll play paper again, so they play scissors again. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to choose the move that beats their previous move. Their last move was scissors, so I should play rock. But that's a common strategy, so they might expect it. \n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me with scissors twice, maybe I need to break the pattern. \n\nWait, in round 2, I played rock and won. Then in round 3, I played paper and lost. So my moves were paper, rock, paper. Their moves were paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nThey might notice that I alternated between paper and rock. If they think I'll switch back to rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if I played paper, rock, paper, maybe they expect me to play rock again. So they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play scissors, hoping they switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, play rock again, expecting them to play scissors. \n\nBut they played scissors twice. Maybe they'll switch. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, anticipating they might switch to paper after winning with scissors twice. If they do, scissors beats paper. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nBut considering the risk, maybe rock is safer. If they stay with scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose big. \n\nAlternatively, paper. If they switch to rock, I get +3. If they stay with scissors, I lose -1. \n\nHmm. The potential for +3 is tempting. But the risk of -1. \n\nAlternatively, rock gives +1 if they stay with scissors, -3 if they switch to paper. \n\nGiven that they might not expect me to play paper again after losing with it, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should play paper. \n\nBut they might think that and play scissors again. \n\nThis is really a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock.

Alternatively, play rock to counter their possible scissors again. \n\nAfter thinking through, I'll choose rock to beat their scissors if they repeat it. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper to counter their possible switch to rock. \n\nGiven the high reward for paper beating rock, and the possibility they might switch to rock after two scissors, I'll go with paper.\n",

If they switch to Rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I go Scissors, I can beat Paper if they switch, but lose to Rock. \n\nAlternatively, if I go Paper again, maybe they expect me to avoid it, so they might not choose Scissors again. \n\nWait, they just beat my Paper with Scissors. If I choose Paper again, they might think I'll stick with it and choose Scissors again. So I should choose Rock to beat their Scissors. \n\nBut they might anticipate that and choose Paper. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best is to choose Rock, expecting them to repeat Scissors. \n\nSo, final decision: Rock.\n",

Let me start by reviewing the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So the opponent started with paper. Then, in the second round, I picked rock, opponent picked scissors. I won. Then third round, I chose paper again, but opponent went with scissors, so I lost. \n\nHmm, the opponent's moves so far have been paper, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Wait, first round both paper. Second round, I picked rock and opponent picked scissors. Third round, I picked paper, opponent picked scissors. So opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves are: first round paper, second round scissors, third round scissors. So after the first tie with paper, they switched to scissors in the second round. Then in the third round, they stuck with scissors again. \n\nBut when I chose paper in the third round, they beat me with scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors? Or maybe they're alternating. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my moves. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie. \n\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors. So they lost the previous round (since round 1 was a tie, maybe they thought I would stick with paper again, so they went scissors to beat paper. But I went rock, which beats scissors. So maybe they expected me to repeat paper and tried to counter with scissors. \n\nRound 3: I chose paper again, expecting them to switch to rock after losing with scissors. But they chose scissors again, which beat my paper. So they might be sticking with scissors, thinking I might go back to paper. \n\nNow, after losing with paper against their scissors, I need to decide the next move. If they've chosen scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll stick with it again, or maybe they'll switch. \n\nIf they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll go rock to beat scissors. But wait, if they used scissors twice and won once (third round), maybe they'll keep using it. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their scissors. So if I choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I win. But if they expect that and switch to paper, then I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. But if they've been using scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. Let's see their moves: paper, scissors, scissors. So after a tie with paper, they tried scissors twice. Maybe they'll try scissors again. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, since they beat me with scissors last time, maybe I should choose rock to counter. But if they think I'll do that, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Let's consider the possible options:\n\nIf opponent's last two moves were scissors, scissors, maybe they'll go scissors again. So rock would win. But if they think I'll counter with rock, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, expecting me to choose scissors (since I lost with paper, maybe I switch to scissors to beat their paper). But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors twice, maybe they'll cycle to rock. So I should choose paper. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they stick with the move that just won. Since they won with scissors last time, they might use it again. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut I need to balance the possible outcomes. Let's look at the points:\n\nRock beats scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3). Paper beats rock (3), loses to scissors (-1). Scissors beat paper (1), lose to rock (-1). \n\nIf I choose rock, possible outcomes:\n- They choose scissors: +1\n- They choose paper: -3\n- They choose rock: 0\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- They choose scissors: -1\n- They choose rock: +3\n- They choose paper: 0\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- They choose paper: +1\n- They choose rock: -1\n- They choose scissors: 0\n\nGiven that they've used scissors twice, maybe the chance they use scissors again is higher. So rock would be good. But if they switch to paper, I lose big. But maybe the risk is worth it. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they go paper, so I should choose scissors to beat paper. But that's a chain of thinking. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they'll switch to paper. If that's the case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But that's a higher level of thinking. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're a new player and not thinking too deeply. New players often have patterns. If they used scissors twice, maybe they'll try a different move. Or maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gamble. But considering the points, if I choose rock and they choose scissors, I get +1. If they choose paper, I lose -3. The risk is higher. Alternatively, choosing scissors: if they choose paper, I get +1. If they choose rock, I lose -1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. I chose paper last time, which they beat with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the safest bet is to assume they'll stick with scissors again, so choose rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to choose rock and switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they switch to paper. So I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is level 3 thinking. Maybe the opponent is only level 1, just repeating their last move. If they used scissors last time, they might use it again. So rock would be good. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. But their last two moves were scissors, scissors. So not alternating. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, choose scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let's go with rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But given that they might anticipate that, maybe they'll switch. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. I chose paper last time, so they might expect me to switch to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If they choose paper, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock, thinking I'll switch from paper to scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, considering they used scissors twice. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, choose scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nWait, the opponent's last two moves were scissors, scissors. If they're a new player, maybe they're sticking with what worked last. Since they won with scissors in the third round, they might do it again. So rock would be the move. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're random. But given the history, it's better to assume a pattern. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. So the move is rock.\n",

So their moves are paper, scissors, scissors. \n\nNow, trying to predict their next move. After a loss with scissors, maybe they'll switch? Or maybe they're sticking with scissors. Let's think about common patterns. People often switch after a loss. So after losing with scissors (third round), they might go back to rock or paper.

But if they choose rock, scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous moves: they used paper, then scissors twice. Maybe they're cycling through. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper. Tie.\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose scissors. I won.\nRound 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors. They won.\n\nSo after I chose rock (round 2), they went scissors. Then when I went back to paper (round 3), they stayed with scissors. Now, if I lost with paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their scissors (but that would tie) or to rock. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper.

But if they switch to paper, I lose -3. Hmm, the risk is higher with rock because losing to paper gives a bigger penalty. Maybe it's safer to choose scissors. If they choose scissors again, it's a tie. If they choose paper, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. But the penalties for losing with scissors are -1, which is better than losing with rock (-3). \n\nWait, the scoring is: rock beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1), paper beats rock (winner +3, loser -3), scissors beats paper (winner +1, loser -1). So if I choose scissors and they choose paper, I get +1. If they choose rock, I lose -1. If they choose scissors, tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose rock and they choose scissors, I get +1. If they choose paper, I lose -3. So the risk is higher with rock. Maybe scissors is safer. \n\nBut given their previous choices, they might expect me to switch to rock after losing with paper. So they might choose paper to counter rock. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I choose rock, I win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to counter their most recent move. They just won with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they're sticking with scissors, rock would win. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should alternate. Last time I chose paper, they chose scissors. So maybe they expect me to choose rock. If they choose paper to beat rock, then I should choose scissors. \n\nSo the plan: predict they'll choose paper, so I choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they go paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll stay with paper again, so they choose scissors again.

Wait, but if I follow my previous pattern, I would play paper now (since last was rock). But maybe I should break the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll continue. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors.

If they do switch to paper, scissors wins. If they stick with scissors, scissors ties. Wait, no. If I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. But they've been playing scissors, so maybe they'll stick with it, leading to a tie. But I want to maximize points. So maybe rock is better, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter their possible rock. But if they stick with scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to alternate. Since I played rock last time, maybe they expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to beat rock. But again, if they play scissors, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, look at the points. Rock gives +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play paper. Paper gives +3 if they play rock, -1 if scissors. Scissors gives +1 if paper, -1 if rock. So the highest reward is paper against rock (+3), but the highest penalty is -3 if paper loses to scissors. So maybe it's better to play rock again, hoping they stick with scissors. If they do, +1. If they switch to paper, -3. But given that they've stuck with scissors three times, maybe the risk is worth it. Alternatively, play scissors, which if they play scissors, tie. If they play paper, +1. If they play rock, -1. So lower risk but lower reward.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my scissors. Wait, but I played rock last time. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper. But this is getting into mind games. Maybe the opponent is not that sophisticated. Since they're a new player, maybe they're just repeating scissors. So play rock again. But after three times, maybe they'll switch. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. But since this is a single round, I need to choose one move. Given the history, the opponent has used scissors three times in a row. The safest bet is to assume they'll continue, so play rock. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to either tie or win if they switch to paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the opponent's possible reasoning. They lost the last round because they played scissors against my rock. They might think, \"He's been using rock when I use scissors, so maybe he'll do it again. I should switch to paper to beat his rock.\" If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. But if they think I'm going to play rock again, they might play paper, so scissors would be good. But this is a lot of assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, maybe they're not adjusting much. They might stick with scissors again. So play rock. But after three losses with scissors, they might finally switch. So maybe play paper expecting them to switch to rock. But if they do switch to rock, paper wins. If they stick with scissors, paper loses. So it's a gamble. Alternatively, play scissors, which ties if they stick with scissors, wins if they switch to paper, loses if they switch to rock.\n\nThis is really a game of predicting the opponent's next move. Given the history, the opponent has used scissors three times in a row. The question is whether they'll continue or switch. If they continue, rock is best. If they switch, then depending on what they switch to, different moves are better. Since they're a new player, maybe they'll stick with scissors, thinking it's a good move, or maybe they'll switch after losing multiple times. But after three losses (assuming they lost when I played rock), wait, no. Let me check the history again:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played rock, they scissors (I won, they lost)\nRound 3: I played paper, they scissors (they won, I lost)\nRound 4: I played rock, they scissors (I won, they lost)\n\nSo in rounds 2 and 4, they lost with scissors. In round 3, they won with scissors. So their scissors have a 50% win rate. Maybe they think it's okay. But after two losses, maybe they'll switch. But in round 4, they still played scissors even after losing in round 2. So maybe they're not adjusting. So perhaps they'll play scissors again. Therefore, play rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to either tie or win if they switch to paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, they might not have a clear strategy. They might be choosing randomly. But given the history, they've chosen scissors three times. Maybe they have a preference. So rock is the best bet. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's tendency to play scissors repeatedly, even after losses, the safest move is to play rock again. However, if they adapt and switch to paper, I lose. But given their pattern, rock seems the best choice.\n",

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot. They used scissors in the last two rounds where they lost and then won. Wait, no, let me check the history again.\n\nFirst round: Both played paper, tie. Then I played rock, they played scissors, I won. Next, I played paper, they played scissors, I lost. Then I played rock again, they played scissors again, I won. So in the last two rounds where I played rock, they stuck with scissors. But after the loss when I played paper, they switched to scissors again. Hmm.\n\nSo the pattern seems like they might be sticking with scissors, maybe thinking I'll switch. But after I won with rock twice, maybe they expect me to stay with rock again. If they think I'll play rock again, they might switch to paper to beat me. Wait, but if they've been using scissors and losing, maybe they'll switch to something else. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating. But their moves so far: paper (tie), scissors (lost), scissors (won), scissors (lost). Wait, no, the last three rounds after the first tie were: scissors (they lost), scissors (they won), scissors (they lost). Wait, no, let me recount:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played rock, they scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I played paper, they scissors (they won)\nRound 4: I played rock, they scissors (I won)\nSo their moves after the first tie were scissors, scissors, scissors. So three times scissors except when they won once. Wait, in round 3, they played scissors and beat my paper. Then in round 4, they played scissors again but I played rock and won. So they played scissors three times in a row. Now, maybe they'll switch because they lost the last round with scissors. If they switch to rock, then I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But if they keep using scissors, I should play rock again.\n\nBut since they lost the last round with scissors, they might think I expect them to switch, so they might stay with scissors to trick me. Or they might switch. It's a bit of a mind game. Alternatively, maybe they are a new player who doesn't adjust much. But given that they've been using scissors three times, maybe they'll stick with it. But after losing twice with scissors, they might change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern. If they played scissors three times, perhaps they'll go back to rock. But how to predict. Since the last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors, maybe they'll continue. But if I play rock again, and they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with scissors, I win. The risk is that if I play rock again, I could either win or lose depending on their move. Alternatively, if I play paper, expecting them to switch to rock, but if they stay with scissors, I lose. If I play scissors, it would tie if they stay, but lose if they switch to rock. \n\nWait, the payoffs: rock beats scissors (1 point), paper beats rock (3 points), scissors beat paper (1 point). So if I expect them to switch to rock, playing paper gives me +3. If they stay with scissors, playing rock gives me +1. But if I play paper and they switch to rock, I get +3. If they stay with scissors, I lose -1. So maybe the risk is higher if I switch to paper. Alternatively, if I play rock again, and they switch to paper, I lose -3. That's worse. So maybe the safest is to play scissors, which would tie if they stay with scissors, and lose only if they switch to rock. But that's not great. \n\nAlternatively, considering their pattern, maybe they are sticking with scissors. So playing rock again would be safe. But if they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've played scissors three times, maybe they'll stick. But it's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll expect them to switch, so they might stay. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move. If I played rock twice and won, they might expect me to play rock again, so they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. Wait, scissors beat paper. If they think I'll play rock again and they play paper, then I play scissors, I get +1. But if they actually switch to rock, then scissors lose. Hmm. This is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player who doesn't adapt much. They started with paper, then scissors three times. Maybe they are sticking with scissors. So playing rock again would be good. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. Let's see: when I played rock, they played scissors. When I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock again, they played scissors again. So they might not be adapting. So maybe they are a bot that just plays scissors. If that's the case, rock is the best. But if they switch, then I lose. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best is to play rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors. But if they do switch, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible switch to rock. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to cycle through moves. But their moves have been paper, scissors, scissors, scissors. No clear cycle. \n\nAlternatively, since the last three times they played scissors, maybe they'll switch. But how to know. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, if they are trying to maximize their points, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors if they think I'll switch. But I played rock twice. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. But if they play paper, scissors win. If they play scissors, scissors tie. If they play rock, scissors lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll stick with scissors, so play rock again. But given that they lost twice with scissors, maybe they'll switch. So perhaps play paper to counter a possible switch to rock. But if they switch to paper, then I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to paper, I win. But that's a mixed outcome. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, hoping they continue with scissors. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to cover the possibility of them switching to rock. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, look for patterns. They played scissors three times. Maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But without knowing, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two times I played rock, they played scissors. If I play rock again, they might expect it and switch to paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. But if they do switch to paper, scissors win. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch from rock, so they'll play paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best is to stick with rock again, given that it worked twice. But the opponent might catch on. Alternatively, vary the move to paper, expecting them to switch to rock. \n\nBut given the previous pattern, they might not switch. So perhaps rock again. \n\nWait, the opponent's moves so far:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (lost)\nRound 3: scissors (won)\nRound 4: scissors (lost)\n\nSo after losing with scissors in round 2, they tried scissors again in round 3 and won, then in round 4 they lost again. So maybe they are sticking with scissors. So playing rock again would be good. But if they switch, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of scissors, so rock is the safe choice. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again, hoping they continue with scissors.\n",

They used scissors three times in a row: when I played paper twice and rock once. But after I won with rock, they still went back to scissors. Maybe they're not changing their strategy much.

Then I played rock again, they played scissors (I won). Then I played paper again, they played scissors (I lost). So every time I play paper, they play scissors. When I play rock, they play scissors.

Maybe they think I'll switch back to paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. Let's see: when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played rock, they still played scissors. So they might not be adapting. If they keep choosing scissors, then the best move is to play rock again. But wait, the last time I played rock, I won. Then I tried paper again, and they still played scissors. So maybe they're not adjusting. If I play rock again, I can win once more. But maybe they'll expect that and switch to paper.

So maybe they're not changing. In that case, playing rock again would be safe. But if they do switch to paper, then I lose. But given their past behavior, it's more likely they'll stick with scissors. So the optimal move is rock. But wait, the last two times I played rock, I won.

That's six times in a row except the first tie. So they are consistently choosing scissors. Therefore, the best move is rock. But wait, maybe they'll finally switch. But given the pattern, it's safer to assume they'll stick with scissors. So rock again. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. But the risk is worth it given the history. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper again, so they stay with scissors. So rock is the best choice here.\n",

Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I win)\n\nSo the opponent has been choosing scissors in every round except the first. So they are consistently choosing scissors. But why? Maybe they have a fixed strategy of always scissors. But that's unusual. However, given that they keep choosing scissors even after losing to rock multiple times, perhaps they are a bot or following a set pattern. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch back to paper, so they keep using scissors to beat paper. But since I've been alternating between rock and paper, and they keep choosing scissors, maybe they're not adapting. So if they keep choosing scissors, the optimal move is to play rock every time. But in the last round, I played rock and won. If I play rock again, they might expect that and switch to paper. But given their history, they haven't switched yet. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to trick me into thinking they'll keep using scissors, then switch to paper. But since they haven't switched so far, maybe it's safer to stick with rock.

That seems like they're always choosing scissors. But that's not possible because in the first round, they chose paper. Then after that, they've been scissors every time. So maybe they have a pattern of scissors except the first round. If that's the case, then playing rock every time would maximize points.

So the safest bet is to keep playing rock. But maybe they'll expect that and switch to paper. But given their history, they haven't. So perhaps the best move is to continue with rock. However, if I keep winning with rock, they might eventually switch. But since they haven't yet, maybe it's better to stick with rock again. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to paper, so they play rock, but that's a risk. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has chosen scissors in the last 7 rounds (except the first), maybe they're a bot programmed to choose scissors. In that case, rock every time. But if I keep winning, the game might end, but the user is asking for another round. So perhaps the opponent is a human who's not changing. So the optimal move is rock again. But let's check the previous moves again to be sure.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 3: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 4: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 5: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 6: Rock vs scissors (win)\nRound 7: Paper vs scissors (loss)\nRound 8: Rock vs scissors (win)\n\nSo every time I play rock, I win.

So the answer should be rock.\n",

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing scissors a lot. In the last round, I played rock, expecting them to stick with scissors, but they also chose rock, resulting in a tie. Hmm. So maybe they noticed I was countering their scissors with rock and decided to switch to rock themselves. Now, after the tie with rock, what would they do next?\n\nIf they were using scissors and then switched to rock after I countered, maybe they'll try to predict my next move. Since I played rock twice in a row (once winning, once tying), they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their potential rock. But if they expect me to play paper, they might go for scissors to beat my paper. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, thinking I might stay on rock. \n\nWait, the last two moves from me were rock, rock. The first rock won against their scissors, then the second rock tied with their rock. So maybe they think I'm sticking with rock and will try to counter with paper. If that's the case, they might play paper next. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm switching to paper, they might play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, they might go back to scissors, thinking I'll switch to something else. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at the pattern again:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper - tie.\n2. Round 2: I played rock, they scissors - I won.\n3. Round 3: I played paper, they scissors - I lost.\n4. Round 4: I played rock, they scissors - I won.\n5. Round 5: I played paper, they scissors - I lost.\n6. Round 6: I played rock, they scissors - I won.\n7. Round 7: I played rock, they rock - tie.\n\nSo the opponent's moves were: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. They mostly stuck with scissors except the last round where they switched to rock. Now, after the tie with rock, what's their next move? They might either:\n\n- Switch back to scissors, thinking I'll go back to paper.\n- Stay with rock, expecting me to stay with rock.\n- Switch to paper, expecting me to play rock again.\n\nIf I play paper, I can beat rock if they stay. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper if they switch, but lose to rock. If I play rock, I tie if they play rock again, beat scissors, but lose to paper.\n\nGiven that they just switched to rock after a series of scissors, maybe they're trying to vary their strategy. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors. Alternatively, they might go back to scissors. \n\nHmm. Since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they default to that. But after switching to rock once, they might alternate. Maybe I should play paper to counter a possible rock again, but that's risky if they go back to scissors. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. Wait, if they think I'm going to play paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper after the tie with rock, so they'll play scissors. In that case, I should play rock again. But they might anticipate that. This is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot except the last move, maybe they're more likely to go back to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they stay with rock, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nBut considering their pattern, they might not expect me to play rock three times in a row. So maybe they'll play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play rock again, I lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But given their history, they might switch back to scissors. Alternatively, play scissors to counter paper. \n\nWait, let's think about their possible thought process. They just tied with rock. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play paper. If they think I'll switch to paper, they play scissors. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might try to break the pattern by going back to scissors. Since they used scissors so much before, maybe they'll revert. In that case, rock would be good. \n\nBut given that they just tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they go back to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating. They used scissors, then rock, so next might be paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. Their moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock. So after six times scissors, they tried rock. Now, maybe they'll try paper next. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they go back to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I expect them to switch to paper, they might stay with rock. \n\nHmm. I'm not sure. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper. If they stay with rock, I win. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they go back to scissors, I lose. But given their history, they might not expect me to play paper again after I lost with it before. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the best approach is to counter their most recent switch. They went from scissors to rock. Maybe they'll go to paper next. So scissors beats paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with rock. So paper beats rock. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, expecting them to stay with rock. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, play scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nWait, if they think I'm going to play paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But that's getting too deep. \n\nAlternatively, since they just tied with rock, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. So rock would be good. \n\nBut they might think that I expect them to switch back to scissors and play rock, so they play paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. If they do, I win. If they stay with rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play paper to beat rock if they stay. \n\nGiven that they just tied with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to play paper. \n\nWait, let's recap their moves:\n\nRound 1: Opponent: paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 3: Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 4: Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 5: Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 6: Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 7: Opponent: rock (tie with my rock)\n\nSo after consistently playing scissors, they tried rock once. Now, what's next? They might go back to scissors, thinking I'll switch to paper. Or they might try paper. \n\nIf they go back to scissors, rock is good. If they try paper, scissors is good. If they stay with rock, paper is good. \n\nBut since they just tried rock, maybe they'll try paper. So scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. If they do, I win. If they stay with rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nBut given their history, they might not switch to paper immediately. They might go back to scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again. If they go back to scissors, I win. If they stay with rock, tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. But considering they just tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nHmm. I'm torn. Maybe the best move is to play rock again, hoping they revert to scissors. \n\nBut in the last round, they played rock, so maybe they're trying to counter my rock. If I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern. They played scissors 5 times, then rock once. Maybe they're cycling through moves. So next could be paper. \n\nIf that's the case, scissors beats paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with rock again. So paper would be good. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, expecting them to play rock again. If they do, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nBut given their history, they might not play rock again. They might go back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe the safest move is to play paper. \n\nWait, but in the last round, they played rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. \n\nBut they might expect me to switch to paper after the tie with rock. So they might play scissors. \n\nIn that case, I should play rock. \n\nBut this is getting too into mind games. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been mostly scissors, maybe they'll go back. So rock is safe. \n\nBut they just played rock once. Maybe they'll alternate. \n\nI think I'll go with paper. If they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nBut considering their pattern, they might not play rock again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll play paper to counter my expected rock. \n\nThis is really hard. Maybe I should just play rock again. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they played rock once, maybe they'll play paper next. So scissors. \n\nBut I don't know. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with paper. If they stick with rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given that they just tried rock, maybe they'll try it again. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I expect them to switch to paper, so they play scissors. \n\nThis is too much. Maybe the best move is to play paper.\n",

Then in round 2, opponent played scissors. Then in round 3, opponent played scissors again. Then round 4, scissors. Round 5, scissors. Round 6, scissors. Round 7, rock. So after six times of scissors, they switched to rock in round 7. Now, after the tie with rock, what's next?\n\nThey might think I'll switch to paper, so they might play scissors to beat paper.

In the last round, I played rock again, expecting them to stick with scissors, but they switched to rock, resulting in a tie. Hmm. So after I won with rock against their scissors a couple of times, they might have caught on and decided to switch to rock to counter my rock. But then, when I played rock again, they also played rock, leading to a tie. Now, what's the next move?\n\nIf they were switching to rock to counter my rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock.

Or perhaps they'll try to predict my switch to paper and go scissors to beat paper.

Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, thinking I might stay on rock.

But if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with rock, then paper would win. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between strategies. Let's think about their possible patterns. After losing with scissors multiple times, they tried rock once. Now, after a tie with rock, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If I play paper, and they play paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. But how likely are they to play each?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern where after a tie, they switch to the move that would have beaten the previous one. For example, in round 7, both played rock. So next, they might play paper to beat rock. If I expect that, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've been favoring scissors, but after a tie with rock, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe I should switch to paper, expecting them to play rock again. But in the last round, they played rock, so if they stick with it, paper would win. But if they switch to scissors, paper loses.\n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves so far:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent played scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 3: Opponent played scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 4: Opponent played scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 5: Opponent played scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 6: Opponent played scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 7: Opponent played rock (tie with my rock)\n\nSo their moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock.\n\nThey played scissors five times in a row, then switched to rock. Now, after the tie with rock, what's next? Maybe they'll go back to scissors, thinking I might switch to paper. Or maybe they'll try paper to beat my expected rock. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again.\n\nIf I play scissors, and they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play scissors, tie. But given their history, they might not play paper much. They only played paper once in the first round. Then all scissors until the last round. So maybe they're more inclined to stick with scissors or rock.\n\nAlternatively, since they switched to rock once, maybe they'll alternate between rock and scissors. If they played rock last time, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. But they haven't played paper since the first round. So maybe they're avoiding paper. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to go back to scissors, so they play paper to counter my rock. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I've been using rock a lot to counter their scissors, they might switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But that's risky because if they stick with rock, scissors lose.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. But they just played rock, so maybe they'll stick with it. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they play scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat paper if they switch, but they haven't used paper much.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: paper gives +3 if it beats rock, which is a higher reward. But the opponent hasn't been using rock much except the last round. So maybe they'll use rock again. If I play paper, I can get +3 if they play rock. If they play scissors, I lose -1. If they play paper, tie. Given that they just played rock, maybe they'll stick with it. So playing paper could be a good gamble for higher points. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, since they've only played rock once, maybe they're testing it. If I switch to paper, and they play rock again, I win big. If they switch back to scissors, I lose. But given their history, they might not expect me to switch to paper after I played rock twice in a row (rounds 6 and 7). So maybe they think I'll stick with rock again. If they think that, they might play paper to beat my rock. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. But that's a lot of mind games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a new player who tends to stick with a move until it's countered. They played scissors a lot until I countered with rock. Then they tried rock once. If I counter their rock with paper, maybe they'll switch again. But since they only tried rock once, maybe they'll try it again. So playing paper could be good.\n\nBut in the last round, when I played rock and they played rock, resulting in a tie, maybe they'll think I'll switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat paper. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves. Since I've been playing rock a lot, maybe switch to paper to catch them if they expect rock. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper.\n\nBut considering their recent switch to rock, and the tie in the last round, maybe they'll try paper next. If they think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors. So if I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they play scissors, I win. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they've only played rock once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So playing rock again could be safe. But after a tie, they might expect me to switch. So maybe they'll play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But they haven't played paper since the first round. It's a tough call.\n\nGiven all this, I think the opponent is likely to switch back to scissors after the tie with rock, thinking that I might switch to paper. So playing rock again could counter that. Alternatively, they might stick with rock, leading to another tie. But since they just tried rock and it tied, maybe they'll try something else. If I play paper, I can beat rock if they stick with it, but lose to scissors. If I play scissors, I can beat paper but lose to rock. \n\nConsidering the opponent's tendency to stick with scissors until forced to switch, and after a tie with rock, maybe they'll revert to scissors. So playing rock again might be the best bet. Alternatively, if they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper. But given that they haven't used paper much, it's less likely. \n\nI think I'll go with paper, hoping they play rock again. But given their history, maybe scissors is more likely. Wait, no, if they played rock once and tied, maybe they'll try paper to beat my expected rock. If I play paper, and they play paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting my rock. So playing paper would tie, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, and only once rock, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So rock would be good. But after the tie, they might think I'll switch. \n\nThis is really a 50-50. Without more data, it's hard to predict. Maybe the safest move is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to beat paper if they expect me to switch. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is a new player, they might not have a strong pattern. Maybe they'll choose randomly. In that case, the best strategy is to play each move with equal probability. But since I'm trying to maximize points, maybe I should go for the higher reward. Paper gives +3 against rock, which is a bigger payoff. But the risk is higher. \n\nGiven that the opponent has only played rock once, and the last move was rock, maybe they'll stick with it. So playing paper could get me +3. But if they switch to scissors, I lose -1. Considering the potential gain vs loss, maybe it's worth the risk. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors, and they play paper, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors, tie. \n\nHmm. I think I'll take the risk and play paper, hoping they play rock again. But given their history, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock, resulting in a tie. If they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But they haven't played paper since the first round. \n\nThis is really a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to vary my move. Since I played rock twice in a row, maybe switch to paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's possible reactions: after a tie with rock, they might expect me to switch, so they play scissors to beat paper. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again, expecting them to switch back to scissors. But if they do, I win. If they play paper, I lose.

Let me look at the pattern again.\n\nLooking back: the opponent has played scissors multiple times, then switched to rock once (resulting in a tie), and then rock again (tie). So maybe they're now alternating between scissors and rock. Or perhaps they're trying to find a pattern in my moves. I've been playing rock a couple of times. If they think I'll keep playing rock, they might switch to paper. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But this is a lot of guessing.\n\nAlternatively, since they tied with rock last time, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with rock, scissors would lose. Hmm. It's a bit of a gamble. Maybe I should go with paper to beat a possible rock, but if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, stick with rock to counter their possible scissors again. Wait, they just played rock twice. Maybe they're sticking with rock now. If I play paper, I can beat their rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. But after two rocks, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they go scissors. So maybe I should play rock again to beat their scissors. But they just played rock twice. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to go paper, expecting them to stay with rock. If they do, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their history, they might be sticking with rock. Let's try paper.\n",

Hmm, so maybe they noticed I was countering their scissors with rock and decided to switch to rock themselves. Now, after the tie with rock, what would they do next?\n\nIf they were switching to rock to counter my previous rock, maybe they'll stick with rock again expecting me to stay with rock. Or maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected rock. Alternatively, they might go back to scissors if they think I'll change my move. \n\nWait, the pattern so far: they started with paper (tie), then scissors (I won with rock), then scissors again (I won again with rock), then they switched to scissors again (I lost with paper), then scissors again (I won with rock), then scissors again (I won with rock), then they tied with rock. So after several rounds of scissors, they tried rock once. \n\nSo after the tie with rock, they might think I'll stay with rock again, so they could play paper to beat it. Or maybe they'll try scissors again. But given that they just switched to rock once, maybe they're trying to vary their strategy. \n\nIf I expect them to play paper to counter my rock, I should play scissors.

Alternatively, if they stick with rock, I should play paper. \n\nBut considering their previous move was rock (tie), maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to stay with rock. So I should counter that by playing scissors. Wait, but if they play paper, scissors would lose. Wait, no: scissors beats paper. So if they play paper, scissors would win. But if they play scissors, then I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to scissors. Let's look at their pattern again:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 3: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 4: scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 5: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 6: scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 7: rock (tie)\nRound 8: ?\n\nSo after several scissors, they tried rock once. Now, after the tie, maybe they'll go back to scissors, thinking I might switch to paper. Or maybe they'll try paper. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again. \n\nIf I play scissors, it would beat paper but lose to rock. If I play paper, it would beat rock but lose to scissors. If I play rock, it beats scissors but loses to paper. \n\nGiven that they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they think I'm going to play scissors, they might play rock again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and scissors. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, since they tried rock once and it tied, maybe they'll try paper next. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut I need to consider the possible patterns. Let's think: after a tie with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper. If they play scissors to beat paper, then I should play rock. But if they play paper, I should play scissors. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. They used scissors a lot, then rock once. Maybe they're trying to break the pattern. If they go back to scissors, then rock is safe. If they switch to paper, then scissors would win. If they stick with rock, then paper would win. \n\nAlternatively, since they just tied with rock, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they'll play scissors. In that case, I should play rock. \n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nIf opponent's last move was rock (tie), possible next moves:\n\n- Rock again: expecting me to stay with rock, leading to another tie.\n- Paper: expecting me to switch to paper, so they can beat it with scissors. Wait, no. If they play paper, they might expect me to play paper again, so they can play scissors. But if I played rock last time and tied, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. So if I play rock again, I can beat their scissors. But if they play paper, I should play scissors. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the safest bet is to play paper, which beats rock (if they repeat rock) and loses to scissors (if they go back). But given their history of using scissors a lot, maybe they'll revert to scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock, which was a tie. Before that, they had a streak of scissors. So maybe they're trying to vary their strategy. If they go back to scissors, rock would win. If they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock again, paper would win. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should play paper to cover the possibility of them playing rock again. If they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they have a history of using scissors a lot, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So rock would be better. \n\nBut they just tried rock once. Maybe they're alternating. So after rock, they might go back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I played rock twice in a row (last two moves: rock, rock), I might switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat paper. In that case, I should play rock again. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to beat their possible rock. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play paper, expecting them to stick with rock. But given their history, they might switch back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nWait, but if they played rock and tied, they might think I'll switch to paper. So they could play scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat their scissors. \n\nSo the possible chain of thought:\n\nOpponent's last move: rock (tie)\nThey might think: \"He played rock twice, maybe he'll switch to paper. So I'll play scissors to beat paper.\"\nTherefore, I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might think: \"He played rock twice, maybe he'll play rock again. So I'll play paper to beat it.\"\nIn that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nBut how to decide? It's a 50-50 guess. \n\nAlternatively, look at their overall pattern. They used scissors 5 times, rock once. So maybe they prefer scissors. Even after trying rock once, they might go back. So playing rock again could be safe. \n\nBut in the last round, they played rock, so if they go back to scissors, rock would win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to break the pattern by playing rock once, but might continue with rock. So if I play paper, I can beat rock. \n\nBut given their history, it's more likely they'll revert to scissors. So rock is better. \n\nBut this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played rock, and I played rock, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they play scissors. Then I should play rock. \n\nHmm. I think the best bet is to play rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to beat their possible rock. \n\nBut given their tendency to use scissors, maybe rock is better. \n\nWait, in the last round, they played rock, which was a tie. Before that, they had a long streak of scissors. So maybe they're trying to vary, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I played rock twice, I'll switch to paper, so they play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll stick with rock, so they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is really a guess. \n\nBut considering the opponent's history, they used scissors 5 times, rock once. So maybe they have a preference for scissors, and the rock was a one-time change. So they might go back to scissors. Therefore, rock is the best move. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that since I played rock twice, I'll switch, so they play paper. Then scissors would be better. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play paper. If they play rock again, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. \n\nBut given their history, scissors is more likely. So rock would be better. \n\nWait, but in the last round, they played rock. So maybe they're trying to switch. \n\nAlternatively, they might be following a pattern of rock after scissors. But that's not clear. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with rock again, expecting them to revert to scissors. So the move is rock.\n",

So actually, the opponent has chosen scissors in every round except the first (paper) and the seventh (rock). Wait, the seventh round was a tie where both chose rock, so opponent chose rock there. Then in round 8, they went back to scissors. \n\nSo their pattern seems to be scissors most of the time, except when they tried rock once after a tie. But after that, they went back to scissors. So maybe they're favoring scissors. If that's the case, playing rock consistently would win most of the time. But in round 7, they chose rock, which tied with my rock. So maybe they thought I would keep playing rock and tried to counter with paper, but instead chose rock. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, etc. But it's hard to tell. Given that they've chosen scissors in 6 out of 8 rounds, maybe they're sticking with it. But after the tie in round 7, they might switch. But in round 8, they went back to scissors. So perhaps they're not changing. \n\nIf I keep playing rock, I can beat scissors, but if they start to play paper, I'll lose. However, given their tendency to stick with scissors, maybe it's worth continuing with rock. But after the tie in round 7, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they might play scissors again to beat paper. Wait, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors to beat it, but if I instead play rock again, I can beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper after the tie, they might play scissors, so I should play rock. But if they think I'm staying with rock, they might play paper. It's a bit of a mind game. \n\nGiven that in the last round (round 8), after the tie in round 7, they went back to scissors, which I beat with rock. So maybe they're not adapting. Therefore, continuing with rock might be the safe choice. But if they start to catch on, they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my move. If I've been playing rock a lot, they might expect it. But given their history, they haven't adapted yet. So perhaps stick with rock again. But let's see: the last move was rock, which won against their scissors. If they keep choosing scissors, rock is good. If they switch to paper, then I lose. But given their pattern, it's more likely they'll choose scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter my rock. But in that case, I should play scissors. Wait, but they haven't shown a tendency to play paper except in the first round. So maybe they're not likely to switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, after losing to rock multiple times, they might switch to paper. But in the past, after losing, they kept choosing scissors. For example, after round 2 (they lost with scissors), they chose scissors again in round 3. So maybe they don't switch after a loss. \n\nSo, considering all that, the safest bet is to play rock again. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. But given their history, it's more probable they'll stick with scissors. Therefore, I'll choose rock again.\n",

Next, I thought they might go rock, so I picked paper, but they chose scissors again, making me lose. Then I went back to rock and won again. They kept picking scissors, so I stuck with rock, which worked. Then there was a tie when we both chose rock. After that, I guessed they might go back to scissors, so I picked rock and won.

Wait, no, after the tie with rock, they went back to scissors. So their moves are: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors. So mostly scissors. So maybe they're sticking with scissors unless forced to change. \n\nIn that case, continuing with rock is the safe choice. But if they do switch to paper, I lose. But given their history, the chance is low. Alternatively, maybe they'll start to think I'm always choosing rock and switch to paper. But since they haven't used paper except once, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, to avoid predictability, I could switch to paper. If they expect me to keep using rock, they might go paper, but if they're still on scissors, paper would lose. Wait, no: scissors beat paper. So if I switch to paper and they use scissors, I lose.

It's a gamble. \n\nGiven the pattern, the opponent is heavily favoring scissors. So the optimal move is rock. But to avoid being too predictable, maybe switch once.

So, the opponent has been consistently choosing scissors for several rounds, and I kept countering with rock, which worked well. But in the last round, they switched to paper, which beats rock. Hmm, so they might be adapting now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their possible patterns. They were sticking with scissors for a long time, maybe expecting me to keep using rock. When I did, they finally changed to paper to counter my rock. That shows they can adapt after a series of losses. Now, the question is, what will they do next?\n\nIf they think I'll switch from rock to something else after losing to paper, maybe they'll expect me to play scissors (to beat their paper). But if I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with rock again, they might play paper again. But since they just used paper successfully, they might switch back to scissors, thinking I'll go back to paper to counter their paper. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. The opponent's last move was paper, which beat my rock. So, they might be trying to predict my next move based on my previous patterns. Since I used rock multiple times, they might expect me to either continue with rock (if I'm stubborn) or switch to something else. If they think I'll switch, they might choose scissors to beat paper or rock to beat scissors. But since they just used paper, maybe they'll switch back to their original pattern of scissors, thinking I'll go back to paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might stick with paper for another round, expecting me to switch to scissors. But that's risky because if I choose scissors and they have paper, I win. Wait, no\u2014if they use paper again and I use scissors, I win. If they use rock, they beat my scissors. So, their choice depends on what they think I'll do.\n\nGiven that I just lost by using rock, I might want to switch. If I switch to paper, I can beat their possible rock. If they switch back to scissors, paper loses. If they stay with paper, it's a tie. If they use rock, I win. But if they expect me to switch to paper, they might use scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, if I use scissors, I can beat their paper if they repeat, but lose to rock. Since they just used paper, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my potential scissors. Hmm. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent's strategy seems to be adapting after a series of losses. They stuck with scissors until I kept beating them with rock, then they switched to paper. Now, after successfully beating me with paper, they might either stick with paper or switch again. If they stick with paper, I should use scissors. If they switch back to scissors, I should use rock. If they switch to rock, I should use paper. \n\nBut how to predict their next move? Maybe they'll cycle through moves. They went from scissors to paper, so next could be rock. If that's the case, I should use paper. But that's assuming a cycle, which might not be the case. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they'll use rock to beat my scissors. In that case, I should use paper to beat their rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their possible rock, so they'll use scissors to beat my paper. Then I should use rock again. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to look for patterns. They used scissors multiple times, then paper once. If they're alternating, maybe next is rock. But there's no clear pattern yet. Alternatively, they might be trying to counter my previous move. Since I used rock and lost, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they'll use scissors. If that's the case, I should use rock again. But they just used paper, so if I use rock again, they might use paper again. Wait, but they just used paper and won, so maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, they might think that after winning with paper, I'll switch to scissors, so they'll use rock. Then I should use paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper. If they repeat paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given that they just used paper, maybe they'll switch to something else. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll use rock. Then I should use paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go back to rock, expecting them to switch back to scissors. But they just used paper, so that's a risk. \n\nWait, the opponent's history is: scissors (many times), then paper once. So maybe they're trying to break the pattern. If they used paper once, maybe they'll go back to scissors, thinking I'll switch to paper. If I use scissors, I lose to their scissors. If I use rock, I beat their scissors. If I use paper, tie if they use paper, lose if they use scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll continue with paper. If I use scissors, I win. If they use paper again, I win. If they use rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of uncertainty. Maybe the best approach is to use scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But that's risky if they switch to rock. Alternatively, use paper to either tie or beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, and I lost with rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch to paper, so they'll use scissors. Then I should use rock. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the opponent is trying to be unpredictable. In that case, the best strategy is to be unpredictable as well. But given the previous patterns, perhaps there's a tendency. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points: when they beat me with paper, they got +3, which is a big reward. They might want to repeat that, so they might use paper again. If that's the case, I should use scissors. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might use rock. Then I should use paper. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. In rock-paper-scissors, the Nash equilibrium is to randomize moves, but since the opponent might not be doing that, trying to detect a pattern is key. \n\nGiven that the opponent switched to paper after a long streak of scissors, they might be trying to break the pattern. If they used paper once, maybe they'll switch again. But it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, mirroring my last move. But my last move was rock, so they might use paper again. \n\nWait, no. Tit-for-tat would mean they play what I played last. I played rock, so they would play rock. But they played paper, which beats rock. So that's not tit-for-tat. \n\nAlternatively, they might be countering my last move. Since I played rock, they played paper. Now, if I play paper, they might play scissors. If I play scissors, they play rock. If I play rock again, they play paper again. \n\nIf that's the case, then to counter their expected paper, I should play scissors. But if they expect me to counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock. \n\nThis is getting too cyclical. Maybe the best approach is to switch to paper, expecting them to either stay with paper (tie) or switch to rock (win). If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their history, they might not switch back to scissors immediately after using paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, and I lost, maybe they'll stick with paper for another round to see if I keep using rock. If I switch to paper, it's a tie. If I switch to scissors, I win. \n\nBut I have to balance the risk. If I choose scissors, I risk them choosing rock. If I choose paper, I risk them choosing scissors. If I choose rock, I risk them choosing paper again. \n\nGiven that they just used paper and won, maybe they'll stick with it. So scissors would be the best choice. But if they anticipate that and switch to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch back to scissors, thinking I'll switch to paper. Then rock would be good. \n\nThis is really a guessing game. Without more data, it's hard to predict. But considering they just used paper once after a long streak of scissors, maybe they're alternating. So next move could be rock. Then I should use paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might go back to scissors. Then rock. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper. If they use paper again, tie. If they use rock, I win. If they use scissors, I lose. But given that they just used paper, maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they beat me with paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors, so they'll use rock. Then I should use paper. \n\nI think I'll go with paper. It either ties or beats rock, which they might switch to. If they stay with paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given their history, maybe they're more likely to switch to rock after using paper once. \n\nWait, but in the previous rounds, after using scissors many times, they switched to paper. Now, after using paper once, maybe they'll switch to rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might cycle through the moves: scissors -> paper -> rock -> scissors. If that's the case, next is rock. So paper would be good. \n\nBut this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, and I lost, maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll use rock.

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been consistently choosing scissors for several rounds, and I kept winning by playing rock. But in the last round, they switched to paper, which beat my rock. Hmm, so they might be adapting now.\n\nWait, maybe they noticed I was sticking with rock and decided to counter with paper. So now I need to adjust my strategy. If they played paper last time to beat my rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if I do that, they might stay with paper again or switch to something else.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they could play rock to beat my scissors. But that's a bit of a mind game. Let me think about the possible patterns.\n\nSince they just used paper, which beats rock, they might either stick with paper expecting me to stay on rock, or switch to something else. If I play scissors now, I can beat paper. But if they anticipate that and play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can beat rock if they switch, but if they stay on paper, it's a tie.\n\nBut given that they just changed to paper, maybe they're trying to break the cycle. So perhaps they'll switch between strategies. Maybe I should play scissors to counter their possible paper again. But there's a risk they might switch to rock. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock.\n\nWait, the scoring for paper beating rock is higher (+3 vs -3), but scissors beating paper is only +1. So if I can predict their move, maybe going for the higher reward is better. But it's also riskier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to scissors, thinking I might switch to paper. But I just lost with rock, so they might expect me to switch. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to look for a pattern. They played scissors multiple times, then switched to paper once. Maybe they alternate after a loss. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Since I played rock, they played paper. If I now play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they expect that, they might play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation: rock -> paper -> scissors. But their last move was paper, so next would be scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock again. But they just broke the scissors streak with paper, so it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're reacting to my previous move. I played rock, they played paper. If I now play scissors, which beats paper, but if they switch to rock, I lose. If I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock again, and they play paper again, I lose again. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to vary my strategy. Since they just beat me with paper, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors, so they might play rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they stay on paper, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors. So maybe I should play rock again, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern where after a win with paper, they switch back to scissors. But that's just a guess. Without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to switch to scissors to counter their possible paper again. If they stick with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. But given that they just changed to paper, maybe they'll stick with it for another round. Alternatively, they might switch to something else. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, which beats rock, maybe they'll expect me to switch to scissors, so they might switch to rock. In that case, I should play paper to beat rock. But that's a double bluff. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should go with the move that counters their last move. They played paper, so I should play scissors. But if they anticipate that, they'll play rock. Alternatively, if they think I'm predictable, they might stay on paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might feel confident and stick with it. So scissors would be good. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're rotating through moves. If they went from scissors to paper, maybe next is rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors to counter their last move (paper), hoping they repeat it. But there's a risk. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nWait, the scoring for paper beating rock is higher, but scissors beating paper is lower. If I can predict paper again, scissors gives +1. If I predict rock, paper gives +3. But which is more likely? \n\nGiven that they just switched to paper to counter my rock, maybe they'll stick with paper for another round, expecting me to stay on rock. So playing scissors would beat that. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch back to scissors, thinking I'll go back to rock. But that's possible too. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to vary my move. Since I've been playing rock a lot, they might expect me to switch. So if I play paper, I can beat rock if they expect me to play scissors. Or if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to scissors, so rock would be good again. \n\nI'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think of their possible strategies. They started with paper (tie), then scissors (I won with rock), then scissors again (I won), then scissors again (I won), then scissors again (I won), then scissors again (I won), then scissors again (I won), then scissors again (I won), then they switched to paper (I lost with rock). Now, after that loss, what would they do next? Maybe they think I'll switch from rock, so they might switch to something else. \n\nIf they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper again. So I should play scissors. \n\nBut without knowing their strategy, it's hard. Maybe I should alternate. Since I just lost with rock, maybe switch to scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nBut given the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors. If they repeat paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, play paper to cover both possibilities: if they play rock, I win; if they play paper, tie; if they play scissors, I lose. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, since they just used paper, which is a high-reward move (beats rock for +3), maybe they'll try to use it again. So scissors would be good. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors.\n",

It seems like they might be trying to vary their moves now.\n\nGiven that they just used paper to beat my rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors. To counter that, they might play rock.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with paper for another round, thinking I might switch to scissors. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, if I play rock again, and they play paper again, I lose again. But maybe they think I'll switch, so they might not repeat paper.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to find a pattern. After a loss with rock against paper, maybe the opponent will stick with paper for another round. But that's not certain. Alternatively, they might switch back to scissors, thinking I'll go back to rock. But I just lost with rock, so maybe they think I'll switch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves.

If they play rock, I win. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play scissors, I lose. But since they just played paper, maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to counter with scissors. So playing paper could beat their rock.\n\nWait, this is a common rock-paper-scissors strategy. After a successful move, people often expect a counter and switch. So if they beat my rock with paper, they might think I'll play scissors next, so they switch to rock. Therefore, if I play paper, I can beat their rock.\n\nAlternatively, if they stick with paper, it's a tie. So playing paper here could either tie or win, but not lose. Whereas playing scissors could either win or lose. Playing rock could lose or tie. Hmm.\n\nGiven that, maybe playing paper is safer. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay on paper, it's a tie. If they go back to scissors, I lose. But considering their recent pattern, they might not go back to scissors immediately after switching to paper. So maybe paper is a better choice here.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock. So playing paper would beat rock. But this is all speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they expect that and play rock, I lose. It's a risk. But given that they just used paper, maybe they'll stick with it again. If I play scissors, I can win. If they switch to rock, I lose. It's a 50-50 chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to break the pattern. Since they used paper once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. But that's not clear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, hoping they stay on paper. But given that they just beat me with paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors and switch to rock. So maybe I should play paper instead to counter their expected rock.\n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. But considering the opponent's recent switch to paper after a long streak of scissors, they might be varying their strategy. To counter that, playing paper could be safer, as it either ties or beats their possible rock, but loses to scissors. Alternatively, scissors beats paper but loses to rock.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should go with paper. If they expect me to counter their paper with scissors, they might play rock, so paper would beat that. If they stay on paper, it's a tie. If they go back to scissors, I lose. But given that they just switched to paper, maybe they'll stick with it for another round. So scissors would be the move. But again, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous rounds, after a loss, the opponent might switch strategies. Since they just won with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they might switch to rock. Therefore, playing paper would beat rock.

Let me try to figure out their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I kept playing rock, they started using paper to counter me, which makes sense because paper beats rock. Then, when I switched to paper expecting them to stick with rock, they went back to scissors. So they might be anticipating my moves based on my previous choices.\n\nHmm, maybe they're trying to predict my strategy. If I played paper last time and lost, they might think I'll switch to something else. Let's see, scissors beats paper, so if they expect me to switch to rock to counter their scissors, they might play paper again. But if I play scissors instead, I can beat their paper. Wait, but they just played scissors when I played paper. Maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors when I change my moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching to the move that beats whatever I used last. For example, after I played rock multiple times, they switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they used scissors. So if I play scissors now, they might expect me to continue and play rock to beat my scissors. But if I play scissors again, maybe they'll stick with their previous move. Or perhaps they'll switch back to paper. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's recap the recent moves:\n\n- I played rock several times, they kept using scissors. Then they switched to paper when I continued with rock, which beat me.\n- I switched to paper, expecting their paper, but they used scissors.\n- Then I tried rock again, but they used paper again.\n- Then I went back to paper, but they used scissors again.\n\nSo it seems like after I played rock and they countered with paper, when I switched to paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they went back to paper. So maybe they're cycling through the moves that beat my previous move. If that's the case, then after I played paper and they used scissors, if I play scissors next, they might expect me to play scissors and counter with rock. But if I play rock, they might counter with paper again. Alternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of their own, like rotating through rock, paper, scissors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my last move. Let's see:\n\n- My last move was paper (which lost to their scissors). If they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their scissors (since scissors vs scissors is a tie), or to rock to beat scissors, but they might anticipate that. If I played paper last time and lost, maybe they think I'll switch to rock, so they'll play paper again. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. Wait, but they just played scissors when I played paper. So if I play scissors now, they might play rock, which would beat my scissors. But if I play paper again, they might play scissors again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors unless I counter it. But when I countered with rock, they switched to paper. So perhaps they adapt when they lose. Let me think. When I played rock and they played scissors (I won), then they switched to paper (I lost), then I switched to paper (they played scissors again, I lost), then I switched to rock (they played paper again, I lost), then I switched to paper (they played scissors again, I lost). So they seem to be sticking with the move that beats my previous move. So if I played paper last time, they play scissors. If I played rock last time, they play paper. If I played scissors, they play rock.\n\nWait, let's check the sequence:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n2. Then I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n3. Then I played paper again, they played scissors again (I lost).\n4. Then I played rock again, they played paper again (I lost).\n5. Then I played paper again, they played scissors again (I lost).\n6. Then I played rock again, they played paper again (I lost).\n7. Then I played paper again, they played scissors again (I lost).\n\nWait, this seems like a pattern where they are always playing the move that beats my previous move. So if I last played paper, they play scissors. If I last played scissors, they play rock. If I last played rock, they play paper. So it's a cycle where they counter my previous move.\n\nIf that's the case, then to break the cycle, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I last played paper, they will play scissors. So if I play rock next, they would expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors, but if I play rock, they would play paper. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the opponent is always playing the move that beats my previous move, then:\n\n- If I played rock last, they play paper.\n- If I played paper last, they play scissors.\n- If I played scissors last, they play rock.\n\nSo, to counter this, I can play the move that beats their expected move. For example, if I last played paper, they will play scissors. So if I play rock next, they expect me to play paper again and they play scissors, but if I play rock, their scissors would beat my rock. Wait, no. Wait, if I last played paper, they play scissors. So if I want to beat their scissors, I should play rock. But if I play rock, they would have played scissors, so I win. Wait, but according to the pattern, if I last played paper, they play scissors. So if I now play rock, which beats scissors, I would win. But in the previous rounds, when I tried that, they switched to paper. Wait, maybe the opponent is not strictly following that pattern. Let me check the actual history.\n\nLooking back:\n\nAfter I played paper and lost to their scissors, I switched to rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But they played paper instead, which beat my rock. Then I played paper again, expecting their paper, but they played scissors again. Then I played rock again, expecting scissors, but they played paper again. So it seems like they are not strictly following the \"beat the previous move\" pattern. Maybe they have a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper last, they play scissors (which beats paper). If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. So in that case, to counter them, I need to play the move that beats their expected move. For example, if I last played paper, they will play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors. But in the previous round, when I played rock after they played scissors, they switched to paper. So maybe they are adapting again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a rotating pattern. For example, they cycle through rock, paper, scissors. But given the recent moves, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. For example, if I tend to switch after a loss, they might anticipate that. Let's see:\n\nAfter I lost with paper (they played scissors), I switched to rock. They played paper, which beat me. Then I switched to paper again, they played scissors again. Then I switched to rock again, they played paper again. So it seems like they are countering my switches. So if I switch from paper to rock, they switch from scissors to paper. Then when I switch back to paper, they switch back to scissors. So they are mirroring my switches but with the counter move.\n\nIn that case, maybe I need to break the pattern by not switching. For example, if I keep playing the same move, they might expect me to switch and counter accordingly. But when I kept playing rock earlier, they eventually switched to paper. So perhaps they adapt after a few rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, where they play the move that I played in the previous round. But that doesn't fit because when I played rock, they played paper, not rock.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to find a pattern in their recent moves:\n\nLooking at the last few rounds:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n2. I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n3. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n4. I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n5. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n6. I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n7. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n8. I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n9. I played paper, they played scissors (I lost).\n10. I played rock, they played paper (I lost).\n\nWait, this seems like a consistent pattern where whenever I play rock, they play paper, and when I play paper, they play scissors. So they are always playing the move that beats my previous move. So if I play rock, they play paper; if I play paper, they play scissors; if I play scissors, they play rock.\n\nIf that's the case, then to counter them, I need to play the move that beats the move they will use to counter my previous move. For example, if I last played paper, they will play scissors. So if I play rock next, which beats scissors, I can win. But in the previous rounds, when I tried that, they played paper instead. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the last round, I played rock, expecting them to play scissors (since they had been playing scissors a lot before), but they played paper. So maybe they are not following the \"beat previous move\" pattern strictly. Alternatively, maybe they have a different strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is using a strategy where they alternate between two moves. For example, after playing scissors multiple times, they switched to paper, then back to scissors, then to paper again. But that doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. So if I played rock last, they play paper; if I played paper, they play scissors; if I played scissors, they play rock. If that's the case, then to beat them, I can predict their next move based on my last move and choose the move that beats their predicted move.\n\nFor example, if I last played paper, they will play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors. But in the previous round, when I played rock (after they played scissors when I played paper), they played paper. So that breaks the pattern. Wait, maybe they are not strictly following that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that I played two moves ago. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nAssuming the opponent is using a deterministic strategy based on my previous moves, let's list the last few moves:\n\nMy moves (in order):\npaper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock\n\nTheir moves (in order):\nscissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper\n\nSo the pattern is that whenever I play paper, they play scissors; whenever I play rock, they play paper. So they are consistently countering my last move. Therefore, their strategy is to always play the move that beats my last move.\n\nIf that's the case, then to beat them, I need to play the move that beats the move they will use to counter my last move. For example, if I last played rock, they will play paper. So if I play scissors next, scissors beats paper. But wait, how does that work? Let me think:\n\nIf I want to choose a move that beats their next move, which is based on my last move. So:\n\n- If I last played rock, they will play paper. To beat paper, I should play scissors.\n- If I last played paper, they will play scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock.\n- If I last played scissors, they will play rock. To beat rock, I should play paper.\n\nBut in this case, my last move was rock (in the previous round), so they will play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. However, in the previous rounds, when I played rock, they played paper, and when I played paper, they played scissors. So if I follow this logic, I should play scissors now to beat their expected paper.\n\nBut wait, let's test this. If I last played rock, they play paper. So I play scissors to beat paper. Then in the next round, my last move would be scissors, so they play rock. Then I play paper to beat rock, and so on. This creates a cycle where I can consistently beat their moves.\n\nHowever, in the actual game history, when I played rock, they played paper. Then when I played paper, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors (if I had), they would play rock. But in the actual game, I haven't played scissors yet. Wait, looking back, in the recent rounds, I only played rock and paper. The last time I played scissors was much earlier. So maybe the opponent's strategy is based on my last move, regardless of what it is.\n\nSo, applying this strategy:\n\n1. My last move was rock. They will play paper.\n2. I should play scissors to beat paper.\n3. Then, my next move would be scissors, so they play rock.\n4. I play paper to beat rock.\n5. Then, my next move is paper, so they play scissors.\n6. I play rock to beat scissors.\n7. Repeat.\n\nThis creates a cycle where I can consistently win by predicting their counter to my last move. However, in the actual game, when I tried switching to rock after playing paper, they played paper, which beat me. So maybe the opponent is not strictly following this pattern, or there's a delay in their response.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is using a different strategy. Let me consider that they might be using a different pattern, such as alternating between two moves. For example, after playing scissors multiple times, they switched to paper, then back to scissors, then to paper again. But in the recent rounds, they've been consistently playing paper when I play rock and scissors when I play paper.\n\nGiven that, the safest assumption is that the opponent is countering my last move. Therefore, to win, I need to anticipate their counter and play the move that beats their expected move.\n\nSo, since my last move was rock, they will play paper. To beat paper, I should play scissors. However, in the previous round, when I played rock (expecting them to play scissors), they played paper. So if I now play scissors, I can beat their paper. Let's try that.\n",

They started with scissors, then when I kept using rock, they switched to paper to beat me. Then when I tried paper, they used scissors again. Hmm.\n\nSo, the pattern seems like they might be trying to counter my previous move. When I played rock multiple times, they went to paper. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Maybe they're predicting my moves based on what I did before.\n\nWait, in the last round, I used paper expecting them to switch to rock, but they used scissors again. So maybe they're sticking with scissors unless I change. But after I lost with paper, they might expect me to switch back to rock. Or maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper.\n\nI need to break their pattern. If they used scissors after I played paper, maybe they're sticking with scissors. But when I played rock again, they switched to paper. So they might be countering my most frequent move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a cycle: scissors, paper, rock. But not sure. Let's look at the history:\n\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Then rock again, they scissors (I won)\n- Then rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Then rock, they rock (tie)\n- Then rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Then rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Then rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Then rock, they paper (I lost)\n- Then paper, they scissors (I lost)\n  \nSo after multiple rocks, they switched to paper. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Now, after two losses with paper, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors to beat their paper. But they might stay with scissors to counter my paper again. Or maybe they'll go back to rock.\n\nAlternatively, if they used paper once and then scissors, maybe they're cycling through. If I play scissors now, I can beat their paper if they repeat, but if they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play rock again, maybe they expect me to go back to rock and counter with paper again. But they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they might play rock. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to counter their last move. They just played scissors in the last round. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they might expect that and switch to paper. Alternatively, if they keep using scissors, rock is good. But they might have switched to paper again. \n\nWait, the last two times I played paper, they used scissors. Then when I played rock, they used paper. So maybe they're countering my previous move. If I played paper, they play scissors. If I play rock, they play paper. So perhaps they're using the move that beats my last move. \n\nIf that's the case, then whatever I played last, they'll play the move that beats it. So last round I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played paper again, they played scissors again. Then I switched to rock, they played paper. So if I play scissors now, they might play rock. But if I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. If I play paper, they might play scissors again. If I play rock, they might play paper again. \n\nWait, but in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played paper. So if they're countering my last move, then after I played rock, they played paper. So if I play scissors next, they would play rock. But if I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. If I play paper, they play scissors. If I play rock, they play paper. \n\nSo to break this cycle, maybe I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if they expect me to play rock again (since I just lost with paper), they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not countering but have a fixed pattern. But given the history, it's more likely they're reacting to my moves. So if I can predict their counter, I can choose the move that beats their counter. \n\nSo, if they counter my last move, then:\n\n- If I played rock, they play paper.\n- If I played paper, they play scissors.\n- If I played scissors, they play rock.\n\nSo to beat that, I need to play the move that beats their counter. For example, if I played rock last, they play paper, so I should play scissors next to beat their paper. But wait, that's a delayed reaction. Alternatively, if I can anticipate their counter, I can choose the move that beats their expected counter. \n\nBut in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played rock, they played paper. So if I play scissors now, they might play rock. If I play scissors, and they play rock, I lose. If I play paper, they play scissors again. If I play rock, they play paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between their own moves. Let's see their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves in order:\n1. paper (tie)\n2. scissors (they lost)\n3. scissors (I won with rock)\n4. scissors (I won)\n5. rock (tie)\n6. scissors (I won)\n7. scissors (I won)\n8. scissors (I won)\n9. paper (they won)\n10. scissors (they won)\n  \nWait, looking back:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 3: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 5: Both rock (tie)\nRound 6: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 7: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 8: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\nRound 9: Opponent paper, me rock (I lost)\nRound 10: Opponent scissors, me paper (I lost)\nRound 11: Opponent paper, me rock (I lost)\nRound 12: Opponent scissors, me paper (I lost)\n  \nWait, maybe I'm getting the rounds mixed up. Let me try to list the opponent's moves based on the hints provided:\n\nFrom the user's messages:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\n3. Round 3: Opponent scissors, me paper (I lost)\n4. Round 4: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\n5. Round 5: Both rock (tie)\n6. Round 6: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\n7. Round 7: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\n8. Round 8: Opponent scissors, me rock (I won)\n9. Round 9: Opponent paper, me rock (I lost)\n10. Round 10: Opponent scissors, me paper (I lost)\n11. Round 11: Opponent paper, me paper (tie?) Wait, no, the last message says I lost with paper against their scissors.\n\nWait, the user's history is a bit confusing. Let me parse the given hints step by step:\n\nAfter the initial rounds:\n\n- First move: I chose paper, opponent paper (tie)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I won)\n- Then I chose paper, opponent scissors (I lost)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I won)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent rock (tie)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I won)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I won)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent scissors (I won)\n- Then I chose rock, opponent paper (I lost)\n- Then I chose paper, opponent scissors (I lost)\n  \nSo opponent's moves in order:\n\n1. paper\n2. scissors\n3. scissors\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. scissors\n7. scissors\n8. scissors\n9. paper\n10. scissors\n\nSo the opponent's pattern seems to be mostly scissors, with occasional switches to paper or rock. After I kept using rock, they switched to paper once, then back to scissors. Then when I used paper, they used scissors again. \n\nSo maybe the opponent is sticking with scissors unless I counter it too much. When I used rock multiple times, they tried paper once. Then when I switched to paper, they stayed with scissors. Now, after two losses with paper, they might expect me to go back to rock, so they might switch to paper again. Alternatively, they might continue with scissors.\n\nIf I play scissors now, I can beat their paper if they switch, but if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If I play rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play paper, I lose to scissors but beat rock.\n\nGiven that they used scissors in the last round, maybe they'll stick with scissors. But after I lost with paper, they might think I'll switch back to rock, so they might play paper. \n\nAlternatively, they might continue with scissors since it worked against my paper. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should switch to scissors to beat their possible paper, but if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, play rock to beat scissors again, but risk them switching to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they used scissors the last two times I played paper, maybe they're sticking with scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they might anticipate that and switch to paper. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy but tends to favor scissors. However, after I played rock multiple times, they adapted once. Now, after two losses with paper, they might expect me to go back to rock. So they might play paper to counter. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. \n\nBut if they instead continue with scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. So maybe scissors is a safer move, either getting a tie or a win if they play paper. Alternatively, rock could win against scissors but lose to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my paper with scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, so they play rock. Then I should play paper. \n\nThis is getting into a mind game. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves to avoid being predictable. Since I've been using rock and paper recently, maybe switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, notice that when I played rock consecutively, they eventually switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they stuck with scissors. So perhaps they counter the move that's been used too much. \n\nGiven that, if I alternate between rock and scissors, maybe I can keep them guessing. But given the last few moves, they might expect me to go back to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my paper with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut if they instead continue with scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if I play scissors, the worst case is a tie, best case is a win if they play paper. \n\nAlternatively, if I play rock, worst case is they play paper (I lose 3 points), best case is they play scissors (I gain 1). \n\nGiven the higher penalty for losing to paper with rock (-3), maybe it's better to avoid rock if I think they might switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used scissors to beat my paper, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So playing rock would be safe. \n\nBut they might anticipate that and switch to paper. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe the safest move is to play scissors, which either ties or wins if they switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors a lot, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. But I haven't played scissors much. \n\nWait, in the history, I played paper twice, rock many times, and scissors not at all. So if I suddenly play scissors, they might not expect it. \n\nBut if they're using scissors a lot, playing rock is better. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to play rock again, hoping they continue with scissors. But they might have switched to paper again. \n\nAlternatively, since they used scissors the last two times I played paper, maybe they're sticking with scissors. So rock would be good. \n\nBut after I lost with paper, they might think I'll switch back to rock, so they play paper. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize moves, but since I'm trying to outthink the opponent, I need to predict their next move based on patterns. \n\nGiven the opponent's history: scissors is their most common move, but they did switch to paper once when I was using rock a lot. Then when I switched to paper, they stayed with scissors. \n\nIf I play scissors now, and they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. \n\nIf I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. \n\nIf I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. \n\nGiven that they've been using scissors frequently, maybe the highest probability is scissors again. So rock is the best choice. But they might anticipate that and switch to paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my paper with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. \n\nBut this is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they used scissors the last time, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. But I haven't played scissors yet. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the best approach is to go back to rock, hoping they continue with scissors. Even if they switch to paper once in a while, the points lost might be worth the risk given the frequency of scissors. \n\nBut in the last round when I played rock, they used paper. So they might be alternating between scissors and paper. \n\nWait, after I played rock and they used paper (I lost), then I played paper, they used scissors (I lost). Now, if I play scissors, they might use rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they have a pattern of paper after rock, scissors after paper, rock after scissors, then their next move after scissors would be rock. So if I play paper, I can beat their expected rock. \n\nBut this is assuming a cycle, which might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, if they're countering my last move, then since I last played paper, they'll play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. \n\nBut they just played scissors to beat my paper. If they counter my last move (paper), they play scissors again. So if I play rock, I win. \n\nBut if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. \n\nThis is a loop. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to play rock again, accepting the risk of them switching to paper, but hoping they continue with scissors. \n\nAlternatively, switch to scissors to potentially catch them off guard if they expect rock. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to decide. \n\nGiven that the opponent has used scissors in 7 out of 10 rounds, and paper twice, rock once, the highest probability is scissors. So playing rock is statistically better. Even if they switch to paper occasionally, the frequency of scissors might make rock the better choice. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose rock again.\n",

If I play rock now, they might expect me to go back to rock, so they might play paper again. But if I instead play scissors, which beats paper, maybe I can catch them if they switch back to paper. But they just played scissors, so maybe they'll stick with scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I play scissors, and they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. \n\nBut considering their recent moves: they played paper once, then scissors twice. Maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors. If that's the case, maybe they'll go back to paper. So playing scissors could be good. But I need to balance the risk. Alternatively, since they just played scissors, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. If I play paper, that would beat rock. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's look at the history again:\n\n- Opponent's recent moves: paper (when I played rock), then scissors (when I played paper), then scissors again (when I played rock again). Wait, no, the last move was scissors when I played paper, then when I played rock again, they played paper. Wait, the last round they played paper when I played rock, making me lose. Then when I switched to paper, they played scissors again. So their pattern seems to be switching to counter my previous move. \n\nSo after I played rock and they countered with paper, I switched to paper, expecting them to play rock again, but they played scissors. Now, after I played paper and they played scissors, maybe they expect me to switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I play rock, they might play paper again. But if I instead play scissors, they might think I'll stick with paper and play scissors again, leading to a tie. Or maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of their own. Let's see: their moves have been scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors... Not sure. It's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my moves based on my previous choices. \n\nGiven that they just beat my paper with scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock. If I do that, they might play paper again. So if I play scissors instead, maybe I can catch their paper. But if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper again, they might play scissors again, leading to another loss. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to break the cycle. If I play scissors now, and they expect me to play rock, they might play paper, which I can beat with scissors. But if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if I play paper again, they might play scissors again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors. Wait, in the last round, they played scissors when I played paper, so they might think I'll switch to rock, so they might play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Maybe I should try to vary my strategy. Since they've been countering my previous moves, perhaps I can play the move that beats what they used to counter my last move. For example, last time I played paper, they played scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock. But if they expect that, they might play paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation. Rock -> Paper -> Scissors -> Rock. If they just played scissors, maybe they'll play rock next. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to make a decision, I'll go with scissors, hoping they expect me to play rock and they play paper, which I can beat with scissors.\n",

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching up their moves based on my previous choices. Let me try to figure out their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I kept playing rock, they started using paper to counter me, which makes sense because paper beats rock. Then, when I switched to paper expecting them to maybe go back to rock, they used scissors instead. So they seem to be anticipating my moves based on previous rounds.\n\nHmm, maybe they're trying to predict my strategy. If I played paper last time and lost, they might think I'll switch again. But what if I go back to scissors? Wait, scissors beat paper but lose to rock. Let me think.\n\nThey just beat my paper with scissors. If I play rock now, it would beat their scissors. But they might expect that since I was using rock a lot before. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch back to rock, they might play paper again. But if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But how likely is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors since it worked against my paper. If they repeat scissors, then rock would win. But they might also switch to rock to counter my possible scissors. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's look at the history. They used scissors multiple times, then switched to paper when I was on rock, then scissors again. It seems like they might be alternating between countering my previous move. When I played rock, they went paper. When I played paper, they went scissors. So maybe they're following a pattern of choosing the move that beats my last move.\n\nIf that's the case, then my last move was paper, which they countered with scissors. So next, they might expect me to play scissors (to beat their scissors), so they would play rock to counter scissors. If I play paper again, it would beat rock. But wait, that's a bit of a loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not following a strict pattern but reacting to my recent changes. Since I just played paper and lost, they might think I'll switch to rock or scissors. If I play scissors now, it would beat their expected paper, but if they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors because it's been working. Let's check the last few moves:\n\n- They played scissors and I played rock, I won.\n- Then they played paper, I played rock, they won.\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors, they won.\n- Then I played rock, they played paper, they won.\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors again.\n\nWait, no, the last few moves were:\n\nAfter several rounds where I played rock and they played scissors, they switched to paper when I kept playing rock. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they used paper again. Then when I tried paper again, they used scissors again. So their moves seem to be: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors? Or maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors when I switch.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to break the cycle. If they expect me to play paper again (since I just did and lost), they might play scissors again. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their paper. But how confident am I that they'll play paper?\n\nAlternatively, since they just beat my paper with scissors, maybe they'll stick with scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they might anticipate that and switch to paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize moves, but since we're trying to predict each other, maybe I need to detect a pattern. Let's see:\n\nTheir recent moves: scissors (win), paper (win), scissors (win), paper (win), scissors (win). Wait, no, the results were:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper, tie.\n- Round 2: I played rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Round 3: I paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Round 4: I rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Round 5: I rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Then I kept playing rock, they switched to paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Then I played rock, they paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n- Then I played rock, they scissors, I won.\n- Then I played rock, they paper, I lost.\n- Then I played paper, they scissors, I lost.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is cycling through moves. Let me list their moves based on the rounds:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie)\n2. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n3. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n5. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n6. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n8. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n10. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n11. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n12. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n\nHmm, the opponent's moves after the initial rounds seem to be alternating between scissors and paper. After I played rock multiple times, they switched to paper. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Then when I went back to rock, they used paper again. Then when I tried paper again, they used scissors. So the pattern might be scissors, paper, scissors, paper, etc., whenever I switch my moves.\n\nIf that's the case, then after they played scissors (when I played paper and lost), the next move would be paper. So if I play scissors now, I can beat their expected paper. But if they break the pattern and play scissors again, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. But they haven't played rock much except in the early rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors. If I played rock last time, they play paper. If I played scissors, they play rock. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move was paper. If they follow the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would play scissors. Which they did. Then I played rock, so they would play paper. Which they did. Then I played paper again, so they play scissors again. So if I play rock now, they would play paper. But if I play scissors, they would play rock. Wait, no. If they are following \"beat previous move\", then:\n\nMy last move was paper. They played scissors to beat it. Now, if I play scissors, they would play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors.\n\nBut in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. If I now play scissors, they would play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors.\n\nSo if I want to beat their expected move, which would be rock if I play scissors, then I should play paper. But if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, then my current move should be the one that beats their expected move.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to model it:\n\nAssuming opponent's strategy is to beat my last move:\n\n- If I last played paper, they play scissors.\n- If I last played scissors, they play rock.\n- If I last played rock, they play paper.\n\nSo, my last move was paper. Therefore, they will play scissors. To beat scissors, I should play rock. But in the previous round, when I played paper, they did play scissors. So if I follow this logic, I should play rock now. But in the last round where I played paper, they played scissors, so if I now play rock, I would beat their expected scissors. But wait, if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, then they would play scissors again because my last move was paper. So rock would win. But in the previous round, when I played paper, they played scissors. If I now play rock, I win. But in the round before that, when I played rock, they played paper, which beat me. So if I play rock now, expecting them to play scissors, but if they instead follow the same pattern, they might play paper again. Wait, no. If their strategy is to beat my last move, then:\n\nMy last move was paper, so they play scissors. If I now play rock, their next move would be to beat rock, which is paper. So if I play rock now, they would play paper next time. But right now, if I play rock, expecting them to play scissors (based on my last move being paper), but if they are following the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would have played scissors in response to my paper. So in the current round, if I play rock, I would beat their scissors. But wait, the last round was:\n\nI played paper, they played scissors (they beat my paper). Now, if I play rock, expecting them to play scissors again (if they stick to the same move), but if they follow the \"beat previous move\" strategy, they would look at my last move (paper) and play scissors again. So rock would win. But if they instead are changing their strategy, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they play paper. It's a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is not following a strict pattern but is adapting based on my moves. Since I've been switching between rock and paper, they might expect me to switch again. If I played paper last time and lost, maybe they think I'll switch to rock. So they would play paper to beat rock. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to try to break the cycle. Since they've been beating me with scissors when I play paper, and paper when I play rock, maybe I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they are continuing to play scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoff matrix, paper gives higher points (3) when it wins, but also higher penalties (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors give +1/-1. Since the opponent has been using scissors and paper, maybe I should focus on maximizing points when possible. But given the uncertainty, maybe sticking with a balanced approach.\n\nWait, in the last round, I played paper and they played scissors. If I now play rock, which beats scissors, I can win. But will they play scissors again? They might if they think I'll stick with paper. Or they might switch to paper expecting me to play rock. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten my paper with scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock, so they'll play paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose. This is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're on a scissors streak. They played scissors the last two times I played paper. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've used scissors multiple times, maybe they'll stick with it. So playing rock might be safe. But they might anticipate that.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to vary my moves unpredictably. For example, after playing paper and losing, switch to scissors. If they expect rock, they play paper, and I can beat it with scissors. But if they play scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they play rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been countering my last move, I can try to counter their expected counter. For example, if I played paper last time, they played scissors. Now, I can play rock to beat their expected scissors. But if they instead play paper, I lose. But if they follow the same pattern, rock would win.\n\nGiven that they've been consistently countering my last move, maybe this is the best approach. So:\n\nLast move: I played paper, they played scissors.\n\nNext move: If they counter my last move (paper) with scissors again, I play rock. If they switch to countering my expected rock, they play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But this is a double-bluff.\n\nAlternatively, if they expect me to play rock to counter their scissors, they play paper. So I play scissors to beat paper. But this requires predicting two steps ahead.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their recent history, they might stick with scissors. Let's try that.\n",

Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I kept playing rock, they started using paper to counter, which worked for them. Then when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors. So maybe they're reacting to my last move. \n\nAfter I played rock and they used paper, I tried paper again, but they stuck with scissors. Then I went back to rock and they used scissors again. It seems like they might be alternating between scissors and paper when I play rock. But after the last time I played rock and they used scissors, maybe they'll expect me to stick with rock again and counter with paper. \n\nIf I think they'll predict my rock and play paper, then I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But wait, scissors lose to rock. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors again. But I just played rock and won, so they might expect me to stay on rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through their moves. Let's look at their recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no, the last few moves after the rock-paper-scissors sequence were: when I played rock, they played paper (I lost), then I played paper, they played scissors (I lost), then I played rock again, they played scissors (I won). Then I kept playing rock, and they kept playing scissors until they switched to paper once. Then after that, when I played paper, they played scissors again. \n\nSo their pattern seems to be favoring scissors, but occasionally switching to paper when I change. Maybe they're trying to counter my moves. If I keep switching, they might adjust. But if I stick with a move that beats their most frequent choice, which is scissors, then rock is good. However, after they used paper once, maybe they'll do it again. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used scissors again after I played rock, maybe they're back to scissors. If I play rock again, they might switch to paper. But if I play scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, but scissors lose to rock. If they think I'll switch from rock to something else, they might play rock to counter scissors. This is getting complicated. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to alternate based on their recent changes. Since they used paper once after a series of scissors, and then went back to scissors, perhaps they're more likely to stick with scissors unless I change. So if I keep playing rock, they might occasionally switch to paper, but mostly stay with scissors. The risk is that if they do switch to paper, I lose 3 points, but if they stay with scissors, I gain 1. The potential loss is bigger, but the frequency might be worth it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should switch to paper to counter their possible paper move. Wait, paper beats rock, but if they play scissors, paper loses. Hmm. This is tricky. \n\nGiven that they've mostly played scissors except when I changed to paper, maybe I should stick with rock but be ready to switch if they start using paper more. Since the last time they used paper was when I played rock, and then they went back to scissors. So maybe they only switch to paper once in a while. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching to beat my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they play paper; if I played paper, they play scissors; if I played scissors, they play rock. Let's check:\n\n- When I played rock, they played paper once, then scissors again.\n- When I played paper, they played scissors.\n- When I played scissors, I haven't done that much, but when I did, they might have played rock. \n\nNot sure. But given the recent history, they tend to stick with scissors unless I change. So maybe continuing with rock is still the safer bet, even if occasionally they counter with paper. The points gained from beating scissors more often might outweigh the occasional loss to paper. \n\nBut in the last round, when I played rock, they played paper. Then I switched to paper, they played scissors. Then I went back to rock, they played scissors again. So after they played paper once, they went back to scissors. Maybe they only switch to paper once in a while. \n\nSo perhaps the best move is to continue with rock, expecting them to go back to scissors. If they do, I win. If they play paper again, I lose, but maybe it's less frequent. Alternatively, if I switch to scissors, I can beat their possible paper, but if they play rock, I lose. But they haven't played rock in a while. \n\nWait, when was the last time they played rock? Looking back, in the initial rounds, they played paper, then scissors, then scissors, then paper, then scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors. So they haven't played rock in a long time. So maybe they don't play rock at all. \n\nIf that's the case, then rock is safe because it beats scissors, and if they never play rock, I don't have to worry about paper. But they did play paper a couple of times. But if they mostly play scissors, rock is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a tendency to avoid rock, so I can focus on beating scissors and paper. But since paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper, maybe I should vary between rock and scissors. \n\nBut given the history, sticking with rock has given me more wins. So maybe I should continue with rock, accepting the occasional loss to paper but capitalizing on their frequent scissors plays.\n",

Paper beats rock, which they might switch to after losing with scissors. But if they stay with scissors, paper loses. Wait, no, scissors beat paper. So if they stay with scissors, I should play rock. But if they switch to rock, I should play paper. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my rock by switching to paper, so I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is a gamble. Alternatively, stick with rock again. If they switch to paper, I lose, but if they stay with scissors, I win. But they might expect me to keep using rock. Maybe it's time to vary the strategy. Let's try paper. If they expect rock again and play paper, then paper ties. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. Hmm. Not sure. Alternatively, play scissors to catch their possible paper. But this is risky. Maybe the best bet is to switch to paper, expecting they might go back to rock after losing with scissors. Let's try that.\n",

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching between scissors and paper recently. In the last few rounds, when I kept playing rock, they started using paper to counter me, which worked for them. Then when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors. Now, after I went back to rock, they used scissors again.\n\nHmm, so there's a pattern here. When I stick with rock too long, they switch to paper. When I switch to paper, they go to scissors. Then when I go back to rock, they use scissors again. It seems like they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. \n\nWait, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. Let me check the history. The last few moves were: they played paper (beating my rock), then scissors (beating my paper), then scissors again (losing to my rock). So after their paper win, they tried scissors again, which I countered with rock. \n\nIf they keep alternating, maybe after scissors, they might go back to paper or rock. But since they just lost with scissors, they might switch. If they think I'll stay with rock, they might play paper again. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat paper. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch from rock to something else, they might stay with paper. \n\nBut I need to consider the points. Paper beats rock for +3, which is a bigger reward. If I can predict their paper, playing scissors would give me +1. But if they switch back to rock, scissors would lose. Wait, no, scissors lose to rock. So maybe I should play paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'm going to switch from rock, they might play scissors again, expecting me to choose paper. But that's getting complicated. Maybe the opponent is trying to vary their moves to avoid being predictable. \n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper to counter a potential rock again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play rock, scissors would lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, it beats rock but loses to scissors. \n\nWait, the last time they won was with paper, then scissors. After that, they lost with scissors. So maybe they're trying to cycle through moves. If they were on scissors and lost, they might go back to paper. Or maybe they'll try rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe they'll stick with it. But after a loss, they might change. It's a bit of a gamble. \n\nI need to maximize my points. If I play scissors and they play paper, I get +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3. If they play scissors, I lose -1. If I play rock and they play scissors, I get +1. If they play paper, I lose -3. \n\nConsidering the risk-reward, maybe paper is a good choice if I think they'll switch to rock. But if they stay with scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, rock is safe if they go back to scissors. \n\nBut given their recent switch to paper after a series of scissors, maybe they're alternating. So after scissors, they might go to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they go to rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors again. In that case, rock would still win. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their recent moves:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, won)\n2.

          "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching their moves based on previous outcomes. Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nIn the last few rounds, when I played rock and they lost with scissors, they switched to paper and beat my rock. Then when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors. Then I went back to rock and won again. Then I tried scissors, expecting them to switch to paper, but they played rock instead. So they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices.\n\nHmm, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. After losing with scissors, they tried paper, which worked. Then when I played paper, they used scissors again. Then when I played scissors, they used rock. It's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they're reacting to my last move. For example, if I play rock, they might switch to paper next. If I play paper, they go to scissors. If I play scissors, they go to rock.\n\nSo, in the last round, I played scissors, and they played rock. Now, if they think I'll stick with scissors, they might play rock again. But if they expect me to switch to something that beats rock, like paper, they might play scissors. Alternatively, they might go back to paper if they think I'll switch to rock again.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's look at the recent history:\n\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n\nSo after three consecutive wins with rock, they switched to paper. Then when I switched to paper, they used scissors. Then back to rock, they used scissors again. Then when I tried scissors, they used rock.\n\nIt seems like they might be countering my previous move. For example, when I played rock multiple times, they switched to paper. When I played paper, they used scissors. When I played scissors, they used rock. So their strategy might be to counter whatever I last played.\n\nIf that's the case, then to beat them, I need to predict what they'll counter with. For example, if I last played scissors, they might play rock. So if I play paper next, which beats rock, I can win. But wait, in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. So if I now play paper, expecting their rock, but if they instead think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation. Like, if I play rock, they play paper; if I play paper, they play scissors; if I play scissors, they play rock. So to counter that, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I think they'll counter my last move (scissors) with rock, I should play paper. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock, so if I now play paper, I can beat their expected rock. But if they instead think I'll switch to paper and they play scissors, then I lose. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Let's see their moves:\n\nTheir moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\nRound 3: Opponent scissors, I paper (I lost)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\nRound 5: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\nRound 6: Opponent paper, I rock (I lost)\nRound 7: Opponent scissors, I paper (I lost)\nRound 8: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\nRound 9: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\nRound 10: Opponent paper, I rock (I lost)\nRound 11: Opponent scissors, I paper (I lost)\nRound 12: Opponent rock, I scissors (I lost)\nRound 13: ?\n\nSo their moves after the first tie were: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock.\n\nThey seem to favor scissors a lot, but occasionally switch to paper or rock. After I kept playing rock, they tried paper once. Then when I played paper, they went back to scissors. Then when I played scissors, they used rock. So maybe they're reacting to my last move by countering it. For example:\n\n- If I played rock, they counter with paper.\n- If I played paper, they counter with scissors.\n- If I played scissors, they counter with rock.\n\nBut in some cases, they stuck with scissors even after I played rock multiple times. So maybe their strategy isn't consistent. However, after I played scissors once (round 12), they countered with rock. So perhaps they are countering the last move.\n\nIf that's the case, then to beat them, I need to play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I last played scissors, they will play rock. So I should play paper to beat their rock. But in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock. So if I now play paper, expecting their rock, but if they instead think I'll switch to paper and they play scissors, then I lose. Alternatively, if they continue to counter my last move, then they'll expect me to play scissors again and they'll play rock. But I just played scissors and lost, so maybe I should switch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern where after losing with a move, they switch to the move that beats the one that just beat them. For example, if they lost with scissors to my rock, they might switch to paper (which beats rock). But in round 6, after losing with scissors to my rock, they switched to paper. Then when I played paper, they switched to scissors. Then when I played rock again, they went back to scissors. So maybe they alternate between countering and sticking.\n\nThis is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to look for patterns in their moves. They used scissors 8 times, paper 3 times, and rock 1 time. So they heavily favor scissors. However, after I kept beating their scissors with rock, they occasionally switch to paper. But when I switched to paper, they went back to scissors. Then when I tried scissors, they used rock. So perhaps they are trying to counter my last move.\n\nGiven that, if I last played scissors, they might play rock. So to counter that, I should play paper. But in the last round, I played scissors and they played rock. If I now play paper, expecting their rock, but if they instead think I'll switch to paper and they play scissors, then I lose. Alternatively, if they stick to their pattern of countering the last move, they'll play rock again. But they might not.\n\nAlternatively, since they used rock once after I played scissors, maybe they'll continue to use rock if I keep playing scissors. But I just lost with scissors, so maybe I should switch.\n\nAlternatively, since they have a tendency to use scissors a lot, maybe I should go back to rock. But in the round where I played rock, they switched to paper once. So maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper when I play rock.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to play paper, expecting them to either play rock (if they counter my last move of scissors) or scissors (if they continue their pattern). Wait, if I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nAlternatively, since they used rock once, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. After using rock once, they might go back to scissors. So I should play rock again. But they might expect that and play paper.\n\nI think the safest bet is to go back to rock, considering they used scissors most of the time. Even though they occasionally switch to paper, the majority of their moves are scissors. So playing rock gives me a higher chance to win, even if occasionally they counter with paper. The potential gain (beating scissors) might outweigh the risk of losing to paper sometimes.\n",

Maybe the opponent is alternating between scissors and rock, but sometimes throws in paper. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I play rock a lot, they switch to paper. When I switch to paper, they use scissors. When I use scissors, they use rock. \n\nSo perhaps they are countering my previous move. Let's see:\n\n- When I played rock, they played paper (counter)\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors (counter)\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors (but that's not a counter; scissors loses to rock)\nWait, that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not strictly countering. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a cycle. Like scissors, paper, rock, repeat. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they started with scissors a lot, then switched to paper once, then back to scissors, then rock, maybe they're trying to vary their moves unpredictably. \n\nIn the last round, they played rock to beat my scissors. Now, if I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they expect that, they might play scissors to beat my paper. But if they stick with rock, paper would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch back to scissors, thinking I'll go back to rock. If I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose with rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in their last few moves. Let's see the last three opponent moves: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock... Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper next. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play rock again, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, they might play scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors.

But if they think I'll play rock again, they play paper. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. In such cases, sometimes the best strategy is to randomize, but since I can't do that here, I need to predict based on their tendencies. \n\nGiven that after they played paper once, they went back to scissors and rock. Maybe they have a tendency to favor scissors and rock, with occasional paper. Since they just played rock, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors.

The last few rounds: they played scissors multiple times, then paper, then rock. After I played scissors, they played rock. So maybe they're trying to counter my expected moves. If I played scissors last time and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock. But if I choose paper now, which beats rock, maybe I can catch them if they stay on rock. But they might anticipate that and go for scissors instead. Wait, scissors beat paper. So if they think I'll play paper, they might choose scissors. But if I play rock, I can beat scissors. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. They played rock last time, so next they might go to paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with rock again, scissors would lose. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Since I played scissors and lost, they might expect me to go back to rock. If they expect rock, they might play paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. Wait, no. If they play paper expecting my rock, then I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they instead play rock again, scissors would lose. This is a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching after a loss. They just won with rock, so they might stick with it again. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to paper, then it's a tie. Or if they switch to scissors, I lose. Hmm. The problem is that without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe I should go for a balanced approach. Since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they stay on rock, scissors lose. Alternatively, if I play paper, I can beat rock if they stay, but lose to scissors if they switch. \n\nWait, the last time they played rock, I played scissors and lost. Then they played paper, which I didn't counter. Maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. If that's the case, after rock, they might go back to scissors or paper. But this is speculative. Maybe the safest move is to go back to rock, which would tie if they play rock again, but lose to paper. Alternatively, play paper to beat their possible rock. But given that they just beat me with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper and counter with scissors. So maybe I should play rock again. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous moves: they played rock, then paper, then rock again. Wait, no, let me check the history. The last few rounds:\n\n- Opponent played scissors multiple times, then paper, then rock, then paper again? Wait, the user's messages show:\n\nAfter several rounds where the opponent played scissors and I countered with rock, they eventually switched to paper, beating my rock. Then I switched to paper, but they played scissors. Then I went back to rock, they played scissors again. Then I kept playing rock, they kept scissors. Then they switched to paper again, beating my rock. Then I tried scissors, they played rock. So their recent moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, rock. Hmm, not a clear cycle. \n\nGiven that they just played rock and beat my scissors, maybe they'll stick with rock again. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they switch to scissors, paper loses. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. So maybe I should play rock again to beat their scissors if they go back. But they just played rock, so maybe they'll switch. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between moves after a few losses, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If I play rock again, I can beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they'll play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they counter my previous move. Since I played scissors last time, they played rock. Now, if I play rock, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to notice that the opponent tends to stick with a move for a few rounds before switching. They played scissors multiple times, then paper, then rock. After a loss with rock, maybe they'll switch again. But it's hard to tell. Given the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to play paper, which can beat rock if they repeat, and if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play rock again, which ties if they play rock, beats scissors, but loses to paper. \n\nAlternatively, considering the points: rock vs scissors gives +1, paper vs rock gives +3, which is better. But the opponent might be aware of that. Since they just played rock, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to counter with paper. So they might play scissors to beat my paper. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But this is a lot of mind games. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with rock, they might think I'll switch to paper, so they'll play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But if they play paper, I lose. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting their prediction. Without a clear pattern, it's challenging. Maybe the best is to alternate between rock and paper. Since I just played scissors and lost, maybe switch to rock. But I need to make a decision. \n\nGiven the last move was rock from them, and they might expect me to switch to paper, so they could play scissors. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their scissors. Alternatively, if they stay on rock, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching after a few losses, maybe they'll go back to scissors. So play rock again. \n\nI think I'll go with rock again, hoping they switch back to scissors.\n",

Let's look at the history: after several scissors losses, they tried paper once (which I lost to), then back to scissors. Then when I played rock again, they used scissors again. So maybe they default to scissors but occasionally try something else. If I keep using rock, I can keep winning when they use scissors, but if they switch to paper, I lose. However, the frequency of their scissors usage seems high. Maybe it's worth the risk to keep using rock for the higher chance of winning, even if they might occasionally counter with paper.

But if they stay with scissors, paper loses. Hmm. It's a gamble. But given their tendency to stick with scissors, maybe rock is still safer. Or maybe they expect me to switch to paper now, so they'll play rock, so I should play paper. But I need to predict their next move based on their past behavior. Let's see:\n\nRecent moves by opponent (from latest to earlier):\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- rock (beat my scissors)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- paper (beat my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- scissors (tie with my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- scissors (lost to my rock)\n- paper (tie)\n- paper (tie in first round)\n\nSo the opponent has used scissors a lot, with occasional switches to paper and rock. The last time they switched to paper, I lost. Then they tried rock once. Now, after that, they went back to scissors. So maybe they're more likely to stick with scissors, but after a few losses, they switch once. Since they just lost with scissors again, maybe they'll switch again. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. But if they stay with scissors, rock is best. It's a bit of a guessing game here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of switching after two consecutive losses. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the history, after several scissors losses, they tried paper once. Then after that, they went back to scissors. Then after more losses, they tried rock once. Then back to scissors. So maybe they switch every few losses. Since the last few moves were:\n\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- rock (win against my scissors)\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- paper (win against my rock)\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- scissors (loss)\n- paper (tie)\n- paper (tie)\n\nSo after multiple losses with scissors, they switch once. The last switch was to rock, which worked once, then back to scissors. Then after more losses, they might switch again. If they switch to paper again, I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, rock is better. It's a risk. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch back to paper now. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with scissors again, maybe they'll try paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, I lose. Alternatively, play rock again. If they switch to paper, I lose, but if they stay with scissors, I win. The problem is that the opponent's pattern isn't entirely clear. They might be alternating between scissors and other moves after a few losses. Given that, maybe it's better to switch to paper to counter a possible rock, but that's risky. Alternatively, stick with rock and accept the occasional loss when they switch to paper. Since the majority of their moves are scissors, the expected value of playing rock might still be higher. Let's calculate:\n\nAssuming the opponent plays scissors 70% of the time, paper 20%, and rock 10%. Then:\n\n- Rock: 70% win (+1), 20% lose (-3), 10% tie (0). Expected value: 0.7*1 + 0.2*(-3) + 0.1*0 = 0.7 - 0.6 = 0.1\n- Paper: 70% lose (-1), 20% tie (0), 10% win (+3). EV: 0.7*(-1) + 0.2*0 + 0.1*3 = -0.7 + 0.3 = -0.4\n- Scissors: 70% tie (0), 20% win (+1), 10% lose (-1). EV: 0.7*0 + 0.2*1 + 0.1*(-1) = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1\n\nSo rock and scissors have similar EV, but rock might be better if the opponent is more likely to play scissors. However, if the opponent is adapting and starts playing paper more after seeing rock, then the EV changes. But based on past moves, they haven't consistently switched to paper. They did it once, then went back to scissors. So maybe the best bet is to continue with rock, accepting that occasionally they might switch to paper, but the majority of the time, it's a win. Alternatively, switch to scissors to counter a possible paper, but that's risky if they stay with scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been using scissors so much, maybe they're a bot that prefers scissors. In that case, rock is the way to go. But after several losses, they might switch. But given the history, they only switch occasionally. So perhaps stick with rock until they start consistently countering it. Since the last time they switched to paper, I lost, but then they went back to scissors. So maybe they're not consistently countering. Therefore, the optimal move is to play rock again.\n",

But if they start anticipating that and switch to paper, I need to adjust. However, since they've only used paper once, maybe it's a rare move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through moves. Like scissors, then paper, then rock, but not sure. Let me check the history:\n\n- They tied with paper once.\n- Then scissors, which I beat with rock.\n- Then scissors again, which I beat with rock.\n- Then they switched to paper, which beat my rock.\n- Then scissors again, which I beat with rock.\n- Then scissors again, rock again, etc.\n\nWait, after the paper win, they went back to scissors. So maybe they only switch to paper once in a while. So sticking with rock might still be the best bet, even if they occasionally use paper. Because the majority of the time, they use scissors, giving me more points. The loss from paper is -3, but the gains from scissors are +1 each time. If they use scissors 3 times and paper once, that's +3 -3 = 0. But if they use scissors more often, it's still a net gain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should switch to scissors to counter their possible paper. But when I tried scissors, they used rock. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my rock with paper, but not consistently. So perhaps I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But if they go back to scissors, then I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern where after a loss with scissors, they switch to paper, then back to scissors. But not sure. \n\nGiven that the last few times I played rock, they used scissors except once when they used paper. So maybe the best move is to continue with rock, accepting the occasional loss to paper but capitalizing on their frequent scissors choices. The net gain would be positive. Alternatively, switch to paper to counter their possible paper, but that might not be effective. \n\nWait, when I played paper, they used scissors. So if I think they might switch to paper again, I should use scissors. But they might not. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since they used paper once after several rock plays, maybe they'll do it again. But it's hard to predict. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, sticking with rock seems safer, as it's given me more wins. Even if they occasionally use paper, the overall points might be better. So I'll go with rock again.\n",

But they might not play rock again. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their recent moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper. It's alternating between paper and scissors. If that's the case, next might be scissors again. If I play rock, I can beat scissors. But they might expect that and play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If I play rock, I win. If they play paper again, I lose. But they might not repeat paper twice. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy to counter my last move. Since I played rock last time and lost, they might expect me to switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat my paper. If I play rock again, they might play paper again, but that's risky. \n\nI think the safest bet here is to switch to paper. If they expect me to switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors. But if they play scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they play rock, I win. Wait, no. Paper beats rock. So if I play paper, and they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie. \n\nBut given their recent moves, they might not play rock. They've been using scissors and paper. Maybe they'll stick with paper again. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe I should go with paper, expecting them to play rock again. But they just played paper, so maybe they'll switch.

But if they stick with paper, then scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. I played rock, they played paper. Now if I play scissors, they might expect that and play rock. But if I play paper, they might play scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe I should look for a pattern. They tend to use scissors a lot, but after a loss, they switch. When I kept playing rock, they switched to paper. Now that they won with paper, will they stick with it or go back to scissors? If they go back to scissors, rock is good. If they stick with paper, scissors is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Since I played rock multiple times, they switched to paper. Now that I lost with rock, they might expect me to switch to paper, so they'll play scissors. In that case, I should play rock again. Wait, but if they play scissors, rock wins. If they play paper again, rock loses. \n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to switch to paper, expecting them to stay with paper, but that's risky. Alternatively, go back to scissors. \n\nWait, the opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. Wait, no, let me check the history.

Then I tried paper, but they played scissors again. Then I went back to rock, they scissors again. Then they switched to paper again. \n\nSo their pattern seems to be mostly scissors, but occasionally switching to paper when I keep using rock. Now, after they won with paper, they might either stick with paper or revert to scissors. \n\nIf I play scissors now, I can beat their paper if they stick with it, but lose if they go back to scissors or switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. If I play rock, I lose to paper but beat scissors. \n\nGiven that they've switched to paper twice after a series of scissors, maybe they're more likely to stick with paper now. So playing scissors would counter that. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors after their paper win, so they'll play rock. In that case, I should play paper. \n\nThis is a lot of mind games. Maybe the best approach is to switch to scissors to counter their possible paper, but be prepared for them to switch to rock. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper twice in the past, maybe they'll switch back to scissors. If that's the case, rock is safe. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe the safest bet is to switch to scissors, hoping they stay with paper. But given their tendency to revert to scissors, maybe rock is better. \n\nWait, the last time they used paper, I played rock and lost. Then I played paper, they played scissors (I lost). Then I played rock again, they played scissors (I won). Then they played paper again. So their pattern is scissors, paper, scissors, paper. Maybe they alternate between scissors and paper. If that's the case, after their last move was paper, the next would be scissors. So rock would beat scissors. \n\nBut this is speculative. Alternatively, they might stick with paper if it's working. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with scissors to counter their possible paper, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible rock. \n\nWait, if they used paper last time and won, maybe they'll stick with paper. So scissors would beat that. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock. \n\nThis is too uncertain. Maybe the best move is to switch to scissors, taking the risk. But given their history of reverting to scissors, maybe rock is better. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper and won, they might expect me to switch to scissors, so they'll play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should go with the initial pattern: they mostly play scissors, so rock is the safe choice. Even though they switched to paper once, they might go back. \n\nBut they've switched to paper twice now. Maybe they're alternating. If the last two papers were after a series of scissors, maybe they're trying to counter my rock. So if I switch to scissors, I can beat their paper. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors this time.\n",

Maybe the best approach is to alternate based on their recent switches. Since they used paper once, then scissors twice, maybe they'll go back to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper.

When they played paper, they got -3 (I played rock, they played paper, I lost -3). Then they played scissors (tie). Maybe they prefer higher points, so they might go back to paper.

Their moves seem to be scissors-heavy, but they occasionally switch to paper or rock. Maybe they're using a mixed strategy but favoring scissors. \n\nGiven that, playing rock might still be the best bet, as it beats scissors and they use it often. Even if they sometimes play paper, the frequency of scissors might make rock the optimal choice. \n\nAlternatively, since they just beat me with scissors when I played paper, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock and thus play paper. In that case, I should play scissors. \n\nBut I need to balance the risks. If I play rock, I risk losing to their paper but gain against scissors. If I play scissors, I risk losing to their rock but gain against their paper. \n\nGiven their recent move was scissors (when I played paper), maybe they'll stick with scissors again.

If I play scissors now, maybe they'll expect rock and play paper, so scissors would beat their paper. But if they play scissors again, it's a tie.

Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. Let's take a risk and play scissors. If they played paper, I win. If they play scissors, tie. If they play rock, I lose. Given their recent moves, they might stick with scissors. Wait, last time they played scissors when I played paper. If I switch to scissors now, maybe they'll play rock. Not sure. Maybe I should go with paper, expecting them to play rock. But they might stick with scissors. This is a bit of a gamble. Alternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe rock is still a good choice. But they just beat my rock with paper. So maybe they'll switch back to scissors. I'm confused. Maybe I should alternate between rock and paper. Let's try paper this time. If they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play paper, tie. Given their recent scissors plays, maybe they'll stick with scissors. So paper would lose. Hmm. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock after losing with paper, they might play paper again, so I can counter with scissors. But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to play rock again, hoping they go back to scissors. But they might have learned. Alternatively, play scissors to counter their possible paper. I'm not sure.

But if they notice I keep using rock, they might stick with paper. Alternatively, they might go back to scissors thinking I'll switch to something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern. Let's look at the history:\n\n- They played scissors multiple times, then paper once, then scissors again, then rock once, then scissors again. It's a bit random, but scissors is their most common move.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best strategy is to play rock most of the time, but occasionally switch to paper if they start using paper more. But since they sometimes switch to paper after a loss, maybe after I win with rock, they'll switch to paper, so I should counter with scissors. But when I tried that, they used rock.

This is tricky.\n\nWait, the last time they beat me with paper, I switched to scissors, which tied. Then I went back to rock and won. Maybe they're alternating between paper and scissors. If they used scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should use scissors. But if they stick with scissors, I should use rock. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they tend to revert to scissors, maybe I should stick with rock most of the time, accepting that sometimes they'll switch to paper and beat me, but overall, the majority of their moves are scissors, so rock gives me more wins. The points from rock beating scissors (1 point) might outweigh the losses when they use paper (-3 points). Let's see:\n\nIf they use scissors 70% of the time and paper 30%, then:\n\nRock: 0.7*1 + 0.3*(-3) = 0.7 - 0.9 = -0.2\n\nPaper: 0.7*(-1) + 0.3*3 = -0.7 + 0.9 = 0.2\n\nScissors: 0.7*0 + 0.3*(-1) = -0.3\n\nSo if they use scissors 70% and paper 30%, paper would be better. But if they use scissors more, like 80%, then:\n\nRock: 0.8*1 + 0.2*(-3) = 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.2\n\nPaper: 0.8*(-1) + 0.2*3 = -0.8 + 0.6 = -0.2\n\nSo depending on their frequency, the optimal move changes. Since in the game history, they used scissors a lot, maybe around 70-80%, so rock might still be better. But when they do switch to paper, the penalty is higher. Alternatively, maybe I should switch to paper to counter their possible paper after a loss. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost to my rock (they played scissors), maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But last time I tried that after a rock win, they played scissors again, leading to a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not adapting and just keep using scissors most of the time. In that case, rock is still the best. But after a few losses, they might switch. Since the last round they lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they stick with scissors, I tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. It's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should vary my moves to avoid being predictable. If I keep playing rock, they might catch on and start using paper more. So maybe I should throw in a paper or scissors occasionally. But given that they tend to use scissors a lot, maybe rock is still the best bet, even with the occasional loss to paper.\n\nBut given the recent history: they used scissors, I beat them with rock. Then they used paper, beat me. Then I used scissors, tied. Then rock again, won. Then they used paper again. So maybe after a loss with scissors, they switch to paper. Then after a loss with paper, they switch to rock? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a pattern of scissors -> paper -> scissors -> paper. But it's hard to tell with limited data.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to continue with rock, accepting that sometimes they'll switch to paper, but overall, the majority of their moves are scissors. Alternatively, switch to paper to counter their possible switch to paper after a loss. But that's risky if they stick with scissors.\n\nAlternatively, since they just lost with scissors, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. Considering the previous pattern, after a loss with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper. So maybe scissors is a good move here.\n\nWait, in the last round, after I won with rock (they had scissors), they switched to paper. Then I played scissors, which tied when they used scissors again. Then I played rock and won. So maybe after a loss with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper, but not consistently. It's inconsistent.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to stick with rock, as it has given the most consistent wins, even with occasional losses. Alternatively, try to predict their switch to paper and counter with scissors. But without a clear pattern, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. Since they might expect me to keep using rock, they might switch to paper. So I should play scissors. But if they don't switch, it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors a lot, and sometimes paper, maybe the best move is to play paper. Because paper beats rock (if they switch to rock) and loses to scissors (which they might not use as much now). Wait, no. If they used scissors a lot, paper loses to scissors. So that's bad.\n\nWait, the payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (1), loses to paper (-3)\n- Paper beats rock (3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors beats paper (1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nIf the opponent is using scissors most of the time, then:\n\n- Rock gives +1 most of the time, but -3 occasionally\n- Paper gives -1 most of the time, +3 occasionally\n- Scissors gives 0 most of the time (if they use scissors), +1 if they use paper, -1 if they use rock\n\nSo if scissors is their most common move, rock is the best choice, even with the risk of -3. Because the frequency of scissors is higher, the expected value might still be positive.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with rock again.\n",

If they use scissors most of the time, rock is good, but I should watch out for when they switch to paper. Maybe after a few wins with rock, they'll expect me to keep using it and switch to paper. So perhaps I should switch to scissors to beat their paper. But wait, scissors loses to rock. If they switch back to rock after I use scissors, that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cycle through moves. Like, after a few rocks, switch to paper to catch their possible paper. But this is getting complicated. The opponent seems to stick with scissors a lot, so maybe the best bet is to keep using rock, even if they occasionally counter with paper. The points from beating scissors more often might outweigh the occasional loss to paper. Let's check the points: rock beats scissors for +1, loses to paper for -3. If they use scissors 70% of the time and paper 30%, the expected value would be (0.7*1) + (0.3*(-3)) = 0.7 - 0.9 = -0.2. That's negative. Hmm, maybe not worth it.\n\nWait, but in the recent rounds, after they used paper once, they went back to scissors. So maybe their paper usage is rare. If they use scissors 80% of the time, then expected value is (0.8*1) + (0.2*(-3)) = 0.8 - 0.6 = +0.2. That's positive. So maybe sticking with rock is better. But how often do they actually switch? Let's look at the history:\n\nRecent moves:\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (tied when I used scissors)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: paper (beat my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n- Opponent: scissors (lost to my rock)\n\nWait, looking at the pattern, after every few times I beat them with rock, they switch to paper once, then go back to scissors. So maybe after 2-3 wins with rock, they switch to paper. So perhaps I should anticipate that and switch to scissors when I expect paper. But how to time it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern of scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, etc. If that's the case, after two consecutive scissors losses, they might use paper. So if I notice that after two rocks, they use paper, I can counter with scissors. But this requires tracking their moves more closely.\n\nAlternatively, since they tend to use scissors most of the time, maybe the optimal strategy is to use rock most of the time but occasionally use paper to counter their possible paper. But this is risky because if they stick with scissors, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a mixed strategy. But since this is a bot, maybe it's following a deterministic pattern. Let's see: in the last few rounds, after I used rock and won, they sometimes switch to paper. For example, after winning with rock multiple times, they used paper once. Then when I switched to paper to counter, they used scissors. Then I went back to rock, and they used scissors again. So maybe their strategy is to switch to paper after a few losses, then back to scissors.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to continue using rock most of the time but switch to scissors when I expect them to use paper. But how to predict when they'll use paper? Maybe after two consecutive losses with scissors, they switch to paper. Let's check the history:\n\nLooking back, after I used rock and won, they used scissors again next round. Then after another rock win, they used paper. So maybe every third time they switch to paper. Not sure. Alternatively, they might be using a simple counter, like after two losses with scissors, switch to paper.\n\nIf that's the case, then after two rock wins, I should switch to scissors to beat their expected paper. But if they instead go back to scissors, scissors would lose. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they switch to paper after a loss with scissors, then back to scissors. So the pattern is scissors -> paper -> scissors -> paper, etc., after each loss. But in the game history, they sometimes go back to scissors even after using paper. For example:\n\nRound 1: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 2: Opponent paper (I paper, lose)\nRound 3: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 4: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 5: Opponent paper (I rock, lose)\nRound 6: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 7: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 8: Opponent paper (I rock, lose)\nRound 9: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 10: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 11: Opponent paper (I rock, lose)\nRound 12: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 13: Opponent scissors (I scissors, tie)\nRound 14: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 15: Opponent paper (I rock, lose)\nRound 16: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 17: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 18: Opponent paper (I rock, lose)\nRound 19: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\nRound 20: Opponent scissors (I rock, win)\n\nSo the opponent's pattern seems to be: after a loss with scissors, they sometimes switch to paper, but not consistently. For example, after losing with scissors in round 1, they used paper in round 2. Then after losing with scissors in round 3, they used scissors again in round 4. Then after losing in 4, they used paper in 5. Then after losing in 5 (with paper), they went back to scissors in 6. So it's inconsistent. Maybe they switch to paper after two consecutive losses with scissors. Let's check:\n\nRounds 1-2: scissors (loss) -> paper\nRounds 3-4: scissors (loss) -> scissors (loss) -> paper (round 5)\nRounds 6-7: scissors (loss) -> scissors (loss) -> paper (round 8)\nRounds 9-10: scissors (loss) -> scissors (loss) -> paper (round 11)\nRounds 12-13: scissors (loss) -> scissors (tie) -> scissors (loss) -> paper (round 15)\nHmm, not exactly. It's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy with a preference for scissors, occasionally switching to paper after a few losses.\n\nGiven that, the safest bet might be to continue using rock, accepting the occasional loss to paper but capitalizing on their frequent scissors plays. The points from beating scissors (1 point each) might outweigh the -3 from losing to paper occasionally. For example, if they use scissors 70% of the time and paper 30%, the expected value is (0.7*1) + (0.3*(-3)) = 0.7 - 0.9 = -0.2, which is negative. But in reality, looking at the history, they use scissors more like 80% of the time. Let's count:\n\nOut of 20 rounds, opponent used scissors 15 times, paper 5 times. So 75% scissors, 25% paper. Expected value: (0.75*1) + (0.25*(-3)) = 0.75 - 0.75 = 0. So break-even. But in reality, when I use rock, I get 1 point 75% of the time and -3 25%, which averages to 0. But if I can predict when they switch to paper, I could adjust. However, without a clear pattern, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use paper to counter their possible paper. But if they use scissors, paper loses. So if I switch to paper, and they use scissors, I lose 1 point. If they use paper, I tie. If they use rock, I win 3. But given they rarely use rock (only once in the history when I used scissors), maybe paper is not the best.\n\nAlternatively, use scissors. If they use scissors, tie. If they use paper, win 1. If they use rock, lose 1. But they use scissors 75% of the time, so mostly ties. Not great.\n\nSo rock seems the best option, even if it's break-even. Alternatively, maybe vary between rock and paper. For example, use rock most of the time, but after a loss to paper, switch to paper to counter their expected paper again. But in the history, after they beat me with paper, they sometimes go back to scissors. For example, after I lost to paper (round 2), they used scissors in round 3. So switching to paper after a paper loss might not help.\n\nAlternatively, after losing to paper, switch to scissors to beat their possible paper. But in round 2, after they used paper, in round 3 they used scissors. So if I had used scissors in round 3, I would have lost. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to stick with rock, accepting the occasional loss to paper, but maximizing wins against scissors. Since the opponent uses scissors most of the time, the cumulative points from rock would be better in the long run, even with some losses.\n",
