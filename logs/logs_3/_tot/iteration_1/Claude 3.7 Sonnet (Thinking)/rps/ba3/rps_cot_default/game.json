First, I need to analyze the payoffs for each move:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point if I win, -1 point if I lose\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points if I win, -3 points if I lose\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point if I win, -1 point if I lose\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value of each move assuming random play from my opponent:\n   - Rock: (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3 \u00d7 3) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3 \u00d7 -1) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) = 0\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value because the reward for paper beating rock (+3) is significantly higher than its penalty when losing to scissors (-1).\n\n5.

Looking at what they do after ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1 (paper), they played rock\n   - After tie in Round 6 (rock), they played scissors\n   - After tie in Round 7 (scissors), they played paper\n   - After tie in Round 8 (paper), they played scissors\n\n4. There's a pattern here - after ties, they seem to follow paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper...\n\n5. Following this pattern, after our rock tie, they might play paper next.\n\n6. Additionally, many players tend to switch their move after a tie, making paper a likely choice for them.\n\n7. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1 points).\n\n8. If they play rock again, scissors would lose (-1 points).\n\n9. The risk/reward ratio seems reasonable given the pattern evidence.\n\n[move] scissors"

After paper ties in the past:\n   - After Round 1 (paper tie), they played rock\n   - After Round 8 (paper tie), they played scissors\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after ties in general:\n   - No consistent pattern, but they rarely play the same move immediately after a tie\n\n4. Players typically avoid playing the same move consecutively, especially after a tie, so they're unlikely to play paper again.\n\n5. After our previous paper tie in Round 8, they played scissors, which might indicate a tendency.\n\n6. Given their overall move distribution (Rock: 8, Paper: 7, Scissors: 6), scissors is slightly \"due\" in terms of frequency.\n\n7. If they play scissors (which seems likely), rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n8. If they play rock instead, I'd lose (-3), but this seems less likely given the previous pattern after paper ties and tie psychology.\n\n[move] rock"

This might indicate scissors is \"due\" in terms of frequency balancing.\n\nPsychologically, after consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern. Given our rock tie, they might play paper which beats rock, especially as this matches one of their previous patterns after a rock tie.\n\nAnother important consideration is that scissors has been their least used move, making it slightly more likely they'll choose it for balance.\n\nIf they play paper (which seems likely given one previous instance after a rock tie), scissors would be my best counter (+1).\nIf they play scissors (also possible given their balancing needs), rock would be best (+1).\n\nSince I believe paper is more likely than scissors as their next move (based on past behavior after rock ties), scissors is my best choice.",

Looking at their more recent behavior after losses, there's a slight tendency to cycle through rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors and back after losses.\n\n5. Since they just lost with paper, they will likely play either rock or scissors, with rock being slightly more probable based on recent patterns.\n\n6.

Let me analyze what my opponent typically does after losing:\n\nAfter losing in Round 5 (rock), they played rock\nAfter losing in Round 9 (scissors), they played paper\nAfter losing in Round 10 (paper), they played scissors\nAfter losing in Round 13 (paper), they played rock\nAfter losing in Round 14 (rock), they played paper\nAfter losing in Round 18 (rock), they played scissors\nAfter losing in Round 19 (scissors), they played rock\n\nThere's no clear consistent pattern in how they respond to losses, but they never play the same move again immediately after losing with it.

After I've just won with scissors, they might anticipate I'll play scissors again and counter with rock.\n\nHowever, if they think more deeply, they might anticipate that I'd expect them to play rock and therefore would play paper. To counter this second-level thinking, they might play scissors.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I think rock is the most likely move from my opponent:\n1. They have not played scissors after losing with paper recently\n2. They just lost with paper and are unlikely to repeat it\n3.

This means that winning with paper against rock is the most valuable outcome, while losing against paper when playing rock is the most costly (-3 points).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies.

I've lost every round except the first tie.\n\nI initially thought the opponent might be following a classic RPS pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock...), but they've played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. This does suggest a pattern - they could be cycling through the moves in order.\n\nIf they are following this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\nLet's also consider if they're trying to counter my moves:\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock (counter to scissors)\n- Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors (counter to paper)\n- Round 4: I played rock, they played paper (counter to rock)\n\nIt seems like after the first round, they've been perfectly countering my moves. This suggests they might be predicting my strategy or just getting lucky with their choices.\n\nGiven this information, I have two main theories:\n1. They're cycling through moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock next)\n2. They're trying to anticipate and counter my next move\n\nIf theory #1 is true, they'll play rock next, so scissors would be my best counter.\nIf theory #2 is true, they'll try to anticipate what I'll play and counter it.\n\nGiven their pattern of countering me so far, they might expect me to play scissors (to counter their anticipated rock). In that case, they would play rock to counter my scissors.\n\nThis creates a double-think situation. But looking at the pattern and the fact that they've won consistently, I think the most likely move for them is rock (continuing their cycle).\n\nConsidering the payoff matrix:\n- If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play rock, I win 3 points\n- If I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nGiven the risk of continuing to lose, I'll play paper to try to counter their anticipated rock move. This gives me the highest potential gain (+3) and breaks their winning streak if I'm right.",

To counter their potential scissors, my best move would be rock again.\n\nHowever, given that we've just tied with rock, it seems unlikely both of us would play rock again. The opponent might expect me to play paper or scissors next.\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Given that the opponent has played scissors frequently (4 times), paper seems riskier.\n\nI think scissors is a reasonable compromise. It would win against paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), and tie against scissors. Since rock and paper seem equally likely from my opponent given their history, scissors provides a balanced risk/reward profile.",
