    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric rewards. Rock beats paper with +3/-3 points, while the other victories only yield +1/-1. This changes the standard equilibrium. In a standard mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, we would need to adjust our probabilities based on these asymmetric payoffs.\n\nPsychological Strategist: For the first move against a fresh player, we should consider what most players tend to choose initially. Rock is often the most common first move in standard rock-paper-scissors, as studies have shown. If our opponent follows this tendency, we should play paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, the asymmetric payoffs introduce interesting risk considerations. If we play paper and win against rock, we get +1 but if we lose against scissors, we only lose -1. Compare that to playing rock, where winning gives +3 but losing costs -3. Paper actually offers the best risk-reward profile for a first move.\n\nGame Theorist: Good point. Let's also consider that a sophisticated opponent might anticipate our choice and counter it. Given the higher stakes for rock vs paper matchups, the opponent might avoid rock precisely because of the -3 penalty, making scissors more attractive for them.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I still think paper is our best opening move. It counters the common rock first move, and even if we lose, the penalty is minimal at -1.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Paper minimizes our maximum loss while giving us a chance to capitalize on the common rock-first tendency.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper"

Let me clarify what happened in the first round: we played paper, the opponent played scissors, and surprisingly we won 1 point. This contradicts the standard rock-paper-scissors rules where scissors beat paper. Let's double check our understanding of the rules:\n- paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nThere appears to be an unusual rule set where paper beats scissors, not the other way around.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent might be confused by the non-standard rules too. After losing with scissors against paper, they might switch to rock, expecting it to beat our paper based on traditional rules. Or they might stick with scissors thinking they were unlucky.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the unconventional ruleset, our opponent might react in one of two ways: either switch to rock thinking it beats paper (under traditional rules), or stick with scissors believing in regression to the mean. If they switch to rock, we should play scissors. If they stick with scissors, we should play paper again.\n\nGame Theorist: The asymmetric payoffs are also important here. Rock has the highest reward but also the highest risk. Since we won the first round, we could take a riskier approach now with rock. If the opponent switches to rock (thinking it beats our paper), our rock would tie. If they stick with scissors, our rock would lose but only by 1 point.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often don't repeat the same move after losing. I think our opponent will likely switch to rock or paper. Between those two, rock seems more likely as it traditionally beats paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with playing scissors for this round. It would beat rock if that's what they choose, and it would tie against scissors if they repeat.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors"

We won 1 point.\n- Round 2: We played scissors, opponent played rock. We won 1 point.\n\nThis confirms the unconventional ruleset where paper beats scissors and scissors beats rock. Now for the third round, the opponent might be adjusting their strategy after losing twice.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two losses, the opponent is likely to change their pattern dramatically. They've tried scissors and rock, so they might go with paper this round. They may also be detecting that we're countering their moves effectively, so might try to counter our anticipated move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the pattern, the opponent seems to be moving through the three options sequentially: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 potentially paper next. If they play paper, our best response would be rock, which gives us the highest potential reward (+3) if we win.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if the opponent is strategically sophisticated, they might anticipate our rock play and counter with scissors. Let's consider the risk-reward tradeoff here.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\nIf we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\nIf we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since the opponent has lost twice, they're more likely to make a bigger strategic shift. I still think paper is most likely from them, making rock our best play despite the risk.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. The +3 potential reward makes rock an attractive option here, and even if we lose, it's only -1 points. The expected value is positive given our assessment of the opponent's likely move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock"

Tie, 0 points.\n\nThe opponent's sequence has been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They seem to be learning and adapting.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After two losses and a tie, the opponent's behavior is telling. They stuck with rock in round 3 after it at least didn't lose them points. This suggests they might:\n1. Continue with rock, since it's working better for them than their previous choices\n2.

They've played rock for three consecutive rounds despite losing twice with it.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is fascinating behavior. The opponent appears to be anchored to the rock strategy despite poor results. This could be due to:\n1. A belief that rock is somehow \"due\" to win\n2. A simplistic strategy where they're not tracking outcomes\n3. An attempt to be unpredictable by being predictable (reverse psychology)\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their demonstrated pattern, scissors remains our optimal choice. If they stick with rock (highly likely based on observed behavior), we win +1. If they finally switch to paper, we lose -1. If they switch to scissors, we tie. The risk-reward profile favors scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with scissors as our optimal move. Even if the opponent is using some complex meta-strategy, scissors minimizes our maximum loss at -1 while giving us a good chance at another +1 win.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The principle of pattern recognition strongly suggests scissors. However, there's a small possibility that after three consecutive rock moves (and two losses), the opponent might finally switch. But even then, scissors remains a reasonable choice with limited downside.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors it is.

The opponent lost with paper in the last round, so they're highly likely to switch strategies. Players rarely stick with a move that just lost them points, especially when the loss was significant (-3). Based on their previous behavior, they might:\n1.

They finally broke their paper streak and switched to scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a significant development. After four consecutive paper plays, they switched to scissors and won. This suggests they finally adapted their strategy after seeing us play rock repeatedly. They might:\n1. Continue with scissors, expecting us to play rock again\n2. Switch to rock if they anticipate we'll counter their scissors with paper\n3. Return to paper as part of some larger pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Since the opponent just successfully played scissors against our rock, they're likely to stick with scissors for at least one more round. This makes paper our optimal play as it beats scissors in this ruleset.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Players tend to repeat successful strategies at least once. The opponent just won with scissors after a long paper streak, so they're highly likely to play scissors again. Paper counters scissors in this game.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper does have a risk of a -3 loss if they switch to rock, but given their pattern of sticking with successful moves, scissors is their most likely play. The expected value is highest with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper"

They've played scissors twice in a row, losing with it in the most recent round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is interesting. The opponent has shown a pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds (3-4) before switching. However, they just lost with scissors, which might trigger a switch sooner. Based on their established pattern:\n1. They might stick with scissors despite the loss (following their pattern of persistence)\n2. They might switch to rock, anticipating we'll play paper again\n3. They might return to paper after completing a scissors cycle\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern suggests they may stick with scissors despite the loss. However, they've also shown they'll eventually switch after several plays of the same move. This is round 11, and they've just played scissors twice. If we assume they'll either play scissors a third time or switch to rock (most likely alternatives), then scissors would be our safest play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Scissors would tie against scissors and win against rock. The opponent has consistently shown they'll stick with a move for multiple rounds before switching, so scissors again or a switch to rock are their most probable moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors minimizes our maximum loss. If they play scissors, we tie. If they play rock, we win +1. The only risk is if they play paper (-1), which seems less likely given their pattern. The expected value appears highest with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors"

They've now played scissors three consecutive times.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a critical juncture. The opponent has displayed a clear pattern of persistence with each move:\n- Rock for 3 rounds\n- Paper for 4 rounds\n- Scissors now for 3 rounds\n\nBased on this pattern, they're likely at the end of their scissors cycle and may switch to a new move. Their overall pattern suggests they might rotate through the options: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. This would predict a switch to rock next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent follows their established pattern, they should switch away from scissors after three plays. Rock would be their most likely choice based on their previous rotational pattern. In that case, scissors would be our optimal play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The pattern strongly suggests they'll switch to rock. Scissors beats rock in this ruleset, and even if they stay with scissors, we'd only tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors also provides the best risk management. It would win against rock (+1), only lose minimally against paper (-1), and tie against scissors.

They've now played scissors for 5 consecutive rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a significant development. The opponent has broken their previously consistent pattern of 3-4 rounds per move by playing scissors for a fifth time. This could indicate:\n1. They've adapted their strategy, realizing we've figured out their pattern\n2. They're extending their scissors cycle beyond the previous pattern\n3. They're testing if we'll continue to counter with paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Despite the break in pattern, the opponent has shown a strong tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds. Since they've now played scissors for 5 consecutive rounds and we've been successfully countering with paper for several rounds, they're more likely to finally switch, probably to rock as per their original pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After an extended run with scissors that we've successfully countered, they're likely to switch. Their historical rotation suggests rock would be their next move. Scissors would be our optimal play against rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors provides a good risk-reward profile here. If they continue with scissors, we'll tie. If they switch to rock as we predict, we'll win +1. The risk of them playing paper seems lower given their established behavioral patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] scissors"

The opponent has completely broken their previous pattern of 3-4 rounds per move by playing scissors for six consecutive rounds. This suggests:\n1. They've abandoned their previous pattern strategy entirely\n2. They might be testing if we'll eventually switch away from matching their scissors\n3. They could be intentionally trying to establish unpredictability after we successfully countered their pattern\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: The extended scissors run changes our analysis significantly. Since they've maintained scissors for so long despite us successfully countering with paper earlier, there's a strong possibility they'll continue with scissors. Paper would be our optimal play against continued scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The unprecedented length of their scissors streak suggests they're committed to this move for some reason. Paper would win against their likely continued scissors play.\n\nRisk Analyst: While paper has a risk of a -3 loss if they finally switch to rock, the demonstrated extreme persistence with scissors makes continued scissors their most likely play. The expected value is highest with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] paper"

Rock would be our optimal choice against their likely paper play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Despite breaking their pattern with the extended scissors streak, their historical behavior suggests they'll play paper for at least another round. Rock gives us the highest potential reward against paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock provides the best risk-reward profile here.

They've played paper for 2 consecutive rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Despite losing with paper in the last round, the opponent's historical behavior suggests they're likely to stick with paper for at least one more round. Throughout the game, they've consistently played each move for multiple rounds (3-6) before switching, even after losses.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If we play paper: win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper (0)\n- If we play scissors: win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's demonstrated tendency to stick with each move for multiple rounds, they're likely to play paper again despite the recent loss. Rock continues to be our optimal choice, providing a potential +3 win.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Even after losses, they've historically continued with the same move for at least 3 rounds before switching. Rock gives us the highest potential reward against their likely paper play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock provides the best risk-reward profile here. The potential +3 gain significantly outweighs the -1 risk if they unexpectedly switch to scissors. Given their established behavioral pattern, paper remains their most likely play, making rock optimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] rock"
