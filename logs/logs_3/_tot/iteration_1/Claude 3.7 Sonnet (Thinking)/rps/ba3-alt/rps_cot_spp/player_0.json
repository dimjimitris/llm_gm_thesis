    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure of this variant of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: Tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. Analyzing the risk-reward for each move:\n   - Rock: Can win 3 points (vs paper) or lose 1 point (vs scissors)\n   - Paper: Can win 1 point (vs scissors) or lose 3 points (vs rock)\n   - Scissors: Can win 1 point (vs rock) or lose 1 point (vs paper)\n\n4. Rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) with a relatively small potential loss (-1).\n\n5. Paper has the highest risk of a big loss (-3 points) with only a small potential gain (1 point).\n\n6. Scissors has balanced risk-reward (can win 1 or lose 1).\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs, rock offers the best risk-reward ratio for a first move.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me note what happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played paper\n   - I won 3 points\n   - This confirms that rock beats paper in this variant, not the other way around\n\n2. Let me reconsider the game's rules structure:\n   - Rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - This is a reversed version of traditional rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs\n\n3. For my second move, I need to anticipate my opponent's strategy:\n   - They just lost playing paper, so they're likely to change their strategy\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since it worked well\n   - If they think I'll play rock again, they might choose scissors (which beats rock)\n\n4. Analyzing potential outcomes for this round:\n   - If I play rock again: I'll win big if they play paper again, but lose if they switch to scissors\n   - If I play paper: I'll win against scissors, which is what I expect them to play\n   - If I play scissors: I risk losing to paper, but paper seems unlikely after their loss\n\n5. Since I predict my opponent will likely switch to scissors to counter my previous rock play, I'll choose paper to counter that.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern observation:\n   - Their last three moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They've used rock successfully twice recently for big wins\n   - After playing rock, they've historically switched to different moves\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - My recent paper plays have resulted in significant losses\n   - Rock has been punishing for me, with -3 point penalties\n   - I need to adapt to break this losing streak\n\n5. Anticipating their next move:\n   - After using rock successfully, they might repeat it\n   - They might also return to scissors, their most frequent choice\n   - Either way, scissors would be a good response\n\n6. Given their recent pattern, their success with rock, and the game's scoring dynamics, scissors offers the best expected value for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategy change:\n   - Breaking my own pattern is essential\n   - I need to disrupt my opponent's expectation\n   - Instead of continuing to rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, I'll break the cycle\n\n5. My opponent would likely expect me to play paper next following my pattern\n   - If they expect paper, they might play rock to counter\n   - Playing scissors would defeat their anticipated rock play\n\n[move] scissors"

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4-19: I lost 15 consecutive rounds by following predictable patterns\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point.\n\n2. Pattern breakthrough analysis:\n   - I finally broke my 15-round losing streak!\n   - I disrupted my predictable rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle\n   - They played rock, suggesting they expected me to play paper\n\n3. Opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They've been successfully countering my moves\n   - They probably noticed my simple cycling pattern\n   - When I broke pattern, they were caught off guard\n\n4. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing a round, opponents often adjust their strategy\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since it worked)\n   - Alternatively, they might expect me to return to my pattern\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - If they expect scissors again: They might play paper (countering scissors)\n   - If they think I'll return to pattern: They might expect rock next\n   - If they're being cautious: They might play scissors (which would tie with scissors)\n\n6. Given these considerations, paper would be optimal - it beats scissors if they try to counter my previous move, and would at worst tie against paper.\n\n[move] paper"

I won 1 point.\n   - I've now won 2 consecutive rounds after breaking my predictable pattern\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - When I played scissors (round 20), they played rock\n   - When I played paper (round 21), they played scissors\n   - This suggests they might be playing as if this were traditional rock-paper-scissors\n\n3. Opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They appear to be playing by traditional rock-paper-scissors rules, where:\n     * Rock beats scissors\n     * Scissors beats paper\n     * Paper beats rock\n   - But in our reversed game, these relationships are flipped\n\n4. Prediction model:\n   - If they're using traditional thinking, after my paper play they expect me to play rock\n   - In traditional rules, they'd counter rock with paper\n   - In our reversed rules, rock actually beats paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Maximizing expected value:\n   - If they play paper (as predicted): Rock wins (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors again: Rock loses (-1 point)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0 points)\n\n6. Given their apparent strategy pattern and the higher potential reward, rock offers the best expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've played scissors in two consecutive rounds\n   - This suggests they might be favoring scissors currently\n   - My prediction that they were playing by traditional rules was incorrect\n\n3. Evaluating opponent's strategy:\n   - They might be adapting their moves based on my recent plays\n   - They might be recognizing patterns in my moves and countering accordingly\n   - After I lost with rock, they might expect me to switch tactics\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: High risk (-3 points if they play rock)\n   - Paper: Good against scissors, ties with paper\n   - Scissors: Good against rock, vulnerable against paper\n\n5. Given that the opponent has played scissors twice in a row, and scissors in 8 out of 22 rounds overall (their most frequent choice), paper would counter this effectively.\n\n6. Paper offers the best combination of potential win against scissors (which they've favored recently) while minimizing downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

First tie analysis:\n   - This is our first tie in 23 rounds of play\n   - Both of us chose paper simultaneously\n   - This provides new information about my opponent's strategy\n\n3. Post-tie psychology:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - They might expect me to switch from paper\n   - They may also switch their own move to gain advantage\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - If they stick with paper: Rock would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors (their most common choice): Rock would lose (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Rock would tie (0)\n\n5. Considering their historical preference for scissors and the higher potential reward of rock against paper, rock offers the best risk-reward balance.\n\n[move] rock"
