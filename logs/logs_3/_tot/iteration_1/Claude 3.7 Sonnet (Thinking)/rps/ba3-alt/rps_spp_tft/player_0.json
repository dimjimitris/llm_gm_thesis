    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Analyst - for evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. Decision Strategist - for making final decisions\n\nLet me start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff structure. This is a modified rock-paper-scissors game with asymmetric rewards. Rock beating paper gives 3 points, while the other winning conditions only give 1 point. This means rock is the highest-reward move if it wins, but also the highest-penalty move if it loses.\n\nPsychologist: For the first move against a fresh player, people often choose rock as their initial move because it's perceived as strong. However, since this is an AI game, we can't rely too heavily on human psychological patterns.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at expected values, if moves were purely random (1/3 probability each), rock would have an expected value of (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 2/3. Paper would be (-3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) = -2/3. Scissors would be (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0.\n\nDecision Strategist: Based on the expected value analysis, rock appears to be the strongest opening move in a vacuum. However, if the opponent anticipates this and plays paper, we'd suffer a significant penalty. Let's go with paper for our first move as it counters the common rock opening while accepting the risk.\n\n[move] paper"

This could indicate they're trying to counter what they expected to be a first-move rock, or they might have a preference for scissors.\n\nPsychologist: Players often change their strategy after losing a round. Since our opponent lost with scissors, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors) or paper (moving to the next item in the sequence). We should consider this psychological tendency.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play rock next (to beat their previous scissors choice), we'd want to play paper. If they play paper next, we'd want to play scissors. Looking at expected values again, if we assume a higher probability they'll play rock, paper becomes more attractive.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also a possibility they'll stick with scissors, thinking we'll overthink and change our move. In game theory, there's value in unpredictability.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given all perspectives, I think rock is our best move here. It beats scissors (which they might repeat), and while it loses to paper, the probability seems lower that they'll switch directly to paper. The risk-reward ratio is also favorable with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

After ties, players often switch to try to gain advantage, rather than sticking with the same move. If they continue the pattern of playing what beats their previous move, they might choose paper now.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they play paper (beats their previous rock), we should play scissors. If they repeat rock, we should play paper. The highest expected value comes from countering their most likely move based on the observed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also potential that they're using a classic rock-paper-scissors algorithm or pattern. Since we've seen scissors \u2192 rock, if they follow a simple rotation, paper would be next.\n\nDecision Strategist: Based on pattern analysis and psychological tendencies after ties, scissors seems to be our best move. It counters the paper they might play next if they're following the observed pattern, and it has a neutral expected value in random play scenarios.\n\n[move] scissors"

They may try to break the pattern now to gain advantage. After scissors, they might go with paper (to beat an expected rock) or repeat scissors (expecting us to overthink).\n\nRisk Analyst: If they continue their observed pattern and return to rock (as in round 2), we should play paper. Paper has a negative expected value in random play, but if we strongly believe they'll play rock, it's the optimal counter.\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors suggests they might continue with rock next. However, they might also recognize we could be looking for patterns and deliberately break their pattern.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the pattern analysis and that we've had two consecutive ties, I believe paper is our best move here. It counters rock (which appears likely based on their alternating pattern), and while it's vulnerable to scissors, the reward of countering rock (3 points) outweighs the risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Three consecutive ties is notable and suggests they might be mirroring our moves with a one-round delay (except the first round where they had no move to mirror).\n\nPsychologist: This mirroring behavior is interesting - it could be deliberate or coincidental. After multiple ties, players often feel pressure to break the pattern. They might stick with paper expecting us to switch, or they might switch to scissors or rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they're mirroring our previous moves, they'll play paper next (matching our last move). The best counter to paper is rock, which gives us the highest reward (3 points) if we win.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they've detected that we've detected their pattern, they might deliberately break it. In that case, they might anticipate our rock counter and play scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the apparent mirroring pattern and the high reward potential, rock seems to be our best move. Even if they break the pattern and play scissors (worst case), we only lose 1 point, but if they continue mirroring with paper, we gain 3 points. The risk-reward ratio favors rock.\n\n[move] rock"

When a pattern becomes this obvious, players often either continue it (thinking we might not notice) or deliberately break it (thinking we've figured it out).\n\nRisk Analyst: If they continue mirroring, they'll play rock next. The optimal counter to rock is paper, which would give us 3 points.

However, given their history of playing scissors when we play paper, this carries risk.\n\nGame Theorist: An alternative interpretation is that they have a preference for rock (played it 3 times) and scissors (played it twice), with paper being their least favorite move (only once).

They've now played paper against our rock twice in a row, both times resulting in our victory (since rock beats paper in this game). This suggests they either don't fully understand the game's rules or are using a non-optimal strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their move distribution is now scissors: 5, rock: 3, paper: 3. Given that they've played paper against our rock twice and lost both times, they're likely to change strategy. They might expect us to play rock again and counter with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're learning from their losses, they'll avoid paper against our expected rock. Scissors would be their logical choice to counter our rock (since scissors beats rock). To counter their likely scissors play, we should use paper.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Paper seems optimal here - if they play scissors (to counter our expected rock), we win. Even if they play rock, we only lose 3 points, but the pattern suggests they're more likely to play scissors. The risk-reward ratio favors paper.\n\n[move] paper"

We just won with paper against scissors, confirming the unusual rules of this game where paper beats scissors (not the other way around). It's possible our opponent is playing with traditional rock-paper-scissors expectations, explaining their counter-intuitive moves.\n\nRisk Analyst: Their move distribution is now scissors: 6, paper: 3, rock: 3. They heavily favor scissors. Given that we just won with paper against scissors, they might switch to rock, thinking it beats paper (as in traditional RPS).\n\nGame Theorist: If they're operating under traditional RPS expectations, they might play rock next to beat our paper. To counter this, we should play scissors, which beats rock according to these game's rules.\n\nDecision Strategist: Scissors seems to be our optimal move here. If they play rock (expecting it to beat our paper), we win 1 point. If they repeat scissors (their most common move), we tie. And even if they play paper, we only lose 3 points, but their pattern suggests they're less likely to do so.\n\n[move] scissors"
