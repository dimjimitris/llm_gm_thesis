    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Unlike standard RPS, this game has asymmetric rewards:\n- Paper beats rock: Winner +3, Loser -3 (high stakes)\n- Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, Loser -1 (low stakes)\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1 (low stakes)\nThis creates interesting strategic considerations.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For the first move against a fresh opponent, we should consider what most players instinctively choose. Rock is statistically the most common first move in RPS games (roughly 35-36% of first moves), as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nDecision Strategist: Given both insights, if the opponent is likely to play rock first, our optimal counter would be paper, giving us +3 points. However, if they anticipate this and play scissors, we'd lose only 1 point. The risk-reward ratio favors paper as our opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this variant, paper should be played more frequently than in standard RPS due to its higher potential payoff.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Also worth noting that since this is the first move, psychological factors dominate over adaptation or pattern recognition.\n\nDecision Strategist: Paper offers the best combination of high potential gain (+3) with limited downside risk (-1), making it optimal for our opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to predict the opponent's likely response. In RPS games, after a tie, players often switch to a different move, believing their opponent might repeat their move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Exactly. After a tie with both playing paper, many players will switch to scissors, thinking you'll play paper again. This is known as the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" heuristic, though in this case it's \"tie-shift\" to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that reasoning, we should anticipate the opponent switching to scissors. The optimal counter would be rock, which would give us +1 point if they indeed play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also a possibility they might attempt to be one step ahead and play rock, thinking we'll switch to scissors. But the first-order strategy of them switching to scissors is more common.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed. Most casual players aren't thinking multiple levels deep, especially in early rounds. The most common pattern after a tie is to switch to what would have beaten the tied move.\n\nDecision Strategist: Rock seems to be our best move here. If they play scissors as predicted, we win +1. If they play paper, we lose 3 points, but this is less likely based on typical player behavior. If they play rock too, it's another tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

It seems they're not following standard patterns. Let's reconsider our approach.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This suggests they might be using a predetermined sequence rather than adapting to our moves. They went from paper to scissors. If they're using a simple rotation strategy, they might play rock next.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze their potential thinking. After winning with scissors, they might:\n1. Stay with scissors since it worked (win-stay strategy)\n2. Move to the next move in sequence (paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock)\n3. Try to counter what they think we'll play\n\nGame Theorist: Given that scissors beat paper and rock beats scissors, they might anticipate us playing scissors to beat their previous scissors move. This would lead them to play rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. After a win, many players either stick with their winning move or try to anticipate the opponent's adaptation. Since scissors just won for them, they might stick with it, or anticipate us moving to paper and play scissors again.\n\nDecision Strategist: If we expect them to play rock or scissors, paper would be our best move. It beats rock for +3 points, and ties scissors for 0 points. The expected value is higher than our other options.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper also has the highest potential payoff if we're correct.

The classic rotation in RPS is rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, but they seem to be using paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they're following this rotation pattern, their next move would be paper again. The optimal counter to paper is scissors, which would give us +1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: There's strong evidence for this rotation theory. They haven't deviated yet despite the game outcomes.

If they're using the paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock rotation, we should play scissors next.\n\nDecision Strategist: Even if we're wrong, the potential loss from playing scissors is minimal (-1 if they play rock).

The evidence for their alternating pattern is very strong at this point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Also, they may not even realize they've fallen into such a predictable pattern.

They broke their alternating rock-scissors pattern by playing paper in the last round. This could indicate they recognized their pattern was being exploited and have deliberately changed strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: Looking at the larger pattern, after they play paper, historically they've played scissors (Round 1\u21922) and paper again (Round 5\u21926 and now 11\u2192?). There's no clear consistent pattern following paper.\n\nGame Theorist: In a game where the opponent may be adapting, we need to consider what they think we'll play next. After three consecutive wins and then a tie, they may anticipate that we'll continue trying to exploit a pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Given that they just broke their pattern, they might be trying to be more unpredictable now. In such situations, players often revert to simpler strategies like \"win-stay, lose-shift\" or choosing a move that would have won the previous round.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they use \"win-stay\" after a tie, they'll play paper again. If they're trying to counter what they think we'll play, they might anticipate us playing rock (to beat their paper) and play scissors to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this uncertainty, I recommend scissors. If they play paper again, we win +1. If they play rock, we also win +1. Only if they play scissors do we tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

This suggests rock as their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: In this variant, scissors beats rock, giving us +1 point. So if they're most likely to play rock, scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Also, considering we've had two consecutive ties, they might be looking to break the pattern and score a win. Many players revert to moves they've previously had success with - rock has worked well for them in this game.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree that scissors is our best move here.

The opponent seems to be following fairly predictable patterns, especially the scissors \u2192 rock sequence.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this analysis, scissors is clearly our best move. If they play rock as predicted, we win +1. The evidence for this pattern is particularly strong based on their historical behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

However, if we look at their more recent behavior, the last three times they played rock, they followed it with paper. This suggests paper as their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: In this variant, rock beats paper, giving us +3 points. So if they're most likely to play paper, rock would be our optimal move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: We've been extremely successful with our pattern recognition approach, winning 8 of our last 10 rounds with 2 ties. The opponent seems to have developed a new pattern in their recent plays, consistently following rock with paper.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this analysis, rock is our best move. If they play paper as predicted by their recent pattern, we win +3 points, which is our highest possible gain in a single round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
