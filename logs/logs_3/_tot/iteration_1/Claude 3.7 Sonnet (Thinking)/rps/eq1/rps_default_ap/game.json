Rock, paper, and scissors are equally viable first moves in terms of game theory. In a completely random scenario, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n\nMany first-time players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's often perceived as \"strong\" or \"default.\" If I wanted to exploit this tendency, I would choose paper. However, this is just a tendency, not a certainty.\n\nFor my first move, I'll go with paper as a strategic choice based on the common first-move tendency.

In rock-paper-scissors, some psychological research suggests that \"rock\" is often a popular first move for many players, perhaps due to its perceived strength or because it's mentioned first in the game's name.
