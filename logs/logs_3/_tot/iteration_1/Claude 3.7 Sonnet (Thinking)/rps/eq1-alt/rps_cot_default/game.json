Stay with \"paper\" - Some players might switch after a tie, so staying with paper could work if they switch to rock (which paper beats).\n\n2. Switch to \"scissors\" - This would beat \"paper\" if the opponent plays paper again. This is a common counter-strategy after a tie - people often repeat their move.\n\n3. Switch to \"rock\" - This would only work if the opponent switches to \"scissors\".\n\nGiven that we've only had one round, I don't have enough data to establish a pattern from my opponent.
