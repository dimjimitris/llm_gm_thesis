    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me think through this strategically by consulting with different perspectives.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Behavioral Strategist, Decision Analyst, AI Assistant (me)\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a one-shot game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with no prior history, each move has equal expected value. The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). Since this is the first round with a fresh player, we don't have any pattern information to exploit.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: While game theory suggests randomization, human players often have biases. Research shows rock is the most common first move among inexperienced players (approximately 35-40% of first moves), as it's psychologically associated with strength. Paper would be a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider the payoffs. Each move has equal expected value in theory, but if the behavioral insight is accurate, paper gives us a slight edge. The downside risk is minimal since we're just starting the game.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Those are all helpful perspectives. Since this is the first move against a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll follow the behavioral insight that rock is a common first move, and play paper as a counter-strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

In repeated games, we need to adapt based on the limited information we have. The opponent might be using a strategy similar to ours, or it could just be coincidence.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie, players often change their move, assuming the other will repeat. A common pattern is to switch to the move that would beat the previous move - in this case, the opponent might choose scissors to beat our previous paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one data point, we can't establish a definitive pattern. However, notice that the opponent chose paper first instead of the more common rock opening. This might indicate they're using strategic thinking rather than just instinct.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: If they expect us to switch after a tie (which is common psychology), and they think we might choose scissors to counter their potential paper repeat, they might play rock. We need to be one step ahead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Those are good points. The most straightforward counter to scissors (which the opponent might play to beat our previous paper) would be rock.

This could be random coincidence, or the opponent might be mirroring our moves. In repeated RPS games, players often try to identify patterns or develop counter-strategies.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's examine what we know:\nRound 1: We played paper, they played paper\nRound 2: We played rock, they played rock\nThis suggests three possibilities: (1) They're mirroring us exactly, (2) Pure coincidence, or (3) They're following a rotation pattern that happens to match our moves.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After two consecutive ties, most players feel psychological pressure to break the pattern. The natural completion of our sequence would be scissors (after paper and rock). The opponent might anticipate this and play rock to counter, or they might continue the apparent mirroring.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're mirroring, whatever we play will result in another tie. If they're following a rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they'll play scissors next. If they're trying to counter our expected scissors play, they'll choose rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I think paper is our best move.

It appears they broke the mirroring pattern in round 3. They might have anticipated our paper move and countered it.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's sequence so far has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which follows a common rotation pattern. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After winning a round, many players stick with their winning move, thinking it's successful. There's a good chance they might play scissors again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll counter with rock and switch to paper.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to balance between responding to potential patterns and avoiding becoming predictable ourselves. If they're using a rotation pattern, they'll play paper. If they're repeating their winning move, they'll play scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the analysis, rock seems like our best move for this round. It would beat scissors if they repeat their winning move, and it would lose to paper if they're following a rotation. Based on psychological tendency to repeat winning moves, the scissors repeat seems more likely.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

The only deviation was in round 3 when they played scissors against our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The high frequency of matching moves is statistically unusual. Either they're somehow predicting our moves or this is a remarkable coincidence. Their sequence has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie with rock, many players would switch to paper thinking it's a logical progression. If the opponent anticipates this, they might play scissors to counter. Or they might stick with rock given it worked as a tie before.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they seem to have repeated rock after scissors. This isn't a simple rotation. But it's worth noting we haven't played scissors yet, which might give us an element of surprise.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assume they're anticipating our moves and adjusting accordingly, we should make the move they're least likely to expect. Given we've played paper twice and rock twice, scissors might be unexpected.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with using scissors for this round. It breaks our own pattern of alternating between paper and rock, and if they're anticipating us to play paper after the rock tie, scissors would lose.

The probability of this happening by random chance is extremely low.

If they follow rotation and play rock, we'll lose, but this unusual pattern of ties suggests they might be matching our moves intentionally or unintentionally.

Since they've just played scissors and lost, and scissors would be expected next in a rotation, I believe they'll either play rock or paper. Between these options, scissors gives us the best expected outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've been playing a perfect rotation for many rounds: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play rock next, scissors would be our optimal choice (since scissors beats rock). Given their unwavering consistency through twelve straight losses, it's virtually certain they'll continue their pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing scissors for this round. The opponent has shown remarkable commitment to their rotation pattern despite losing repeatedly. If they follow the pattern and play rock, we win again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"
