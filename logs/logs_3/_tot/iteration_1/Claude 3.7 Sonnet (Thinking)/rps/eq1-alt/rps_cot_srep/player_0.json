    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at my opponent's pattern after ties:\n   - After tie in Round 6, they played Rock\n   - After tie in Round 12, they played Rock\n   - After tie in Round 14, they played Paper\n   - After tie in Round 16, they played Rock\n   - After tie in Round 18, they played Paper\n\n3. There seems to be an emerging pattern where they alternate between Rock and Paper after ties. If this pattern holds, they would play Paper after this tie.\n\n4. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 11 times (52%)\n   - Paper: 8 times (38%)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (10%)\n\n5. They've been playing Paper more frequently in recent rounds.\n\n6. Given their potential alternating post-tie pattern and recent Paper usage, they'll likely play Paper next.\n\n7. To counter their expected Paper play, I should use Rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

My opponent has broken their pattern:\n   - They just played Scissors for only the 3rd time in 22 rounds\n   - This is a significant change from their usual Rock-Paper choices\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after wins:\n   - They sometimes continue with winning moves\n   - They've rarely used Scissors, but just won with it\n\n4. Given that they just successfully surprised me with Scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with Scissors since it worked (people tend to repeat successful moves)\n   - Anticipate I'll counter with Rock and switch to Paper\n   - Return to their more common Rock strategy\n\n5. Since they've shown increasing adaptability and just won with a rarely used move, they're most likely to either stick with Scissors or anticipate my counter and play Paper.\n\n6. Paper would be my optimal move as it:\n   - Beats their historically most common move (Rock)\n   - Beats their currently successful move (Scissors)\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent's overall pattern:\n   - Rock: 11 times (48%)\n   - Paper: 9 times (39%)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (13%)\n   - They clearly prefer Rock and Paper\n\n3. Looking at their recent behavior:\n   - They've shown increased variability\n   - They've moved away from their predictable patterns\n   - They've been incorporating Scissors more recently\n\n4. After ties, they've historically favored playing Rock, though not consistently.\n\n5. Given their historical preference for Rock and their tendency to return to it after trying other moves, Rock is their most likely next move.\n\n6. To counter their expected Rock play, Scissors would be optimal.\n\n[move] Scissors"
