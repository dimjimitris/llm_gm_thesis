Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, humans rarely play randomly. The key insight is that this is a zero-sum game with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium - the optimal strategy is mixed (randomized). But since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider human behavioral patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh/new players often exhibit predictable patterns. Research shows beginners tend to: (1) favor rock as an opening move (about 35-40% of the time) due to its symbolic strength, (2) avoid scissors initially as it seems \"weakest,\" and (3) often follow simple patterns like rock-paper-scissors in sequence. The \"rock bias\" in first moves is well-documented.\n\n**Strategic Advisor:** Given that this is the first move against a fresh player, we should exploit the most common behavioral bias. If the opponent is likely to play rock (due to the rock bias), then we should play paper to counter it. This gives us the best probability of winning the first round.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, playing paper seems optimal for the opening move against a fresh player. The psychology research about rock bias in beginners gives us a statistical edge, and since this is just one round, we should maximize our probability of winning rather than trying to be unpredictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. While long-term strategy would require more randomization, for a single move against a fresh player, exploiting the rock bias with paper is the highest expected value play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to counter the common beginner tendency to open with rock) paper",

However, humans rarely play truly randomly. Against a \"fresh player,\" we need to consider common beginner patterns. The most important insight is that this is a zero-sum game where predicting opponent behavior is key.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit predictable patterns. Research shows that beginners tend to favor rock as their first move about 35-40% of the time - it's psychologically seen as the \"strongest\" option. Scissors is chosen least frequently (~25-30%) as it seems \"weakest.\" Paper falls in between. Additionally, fresh players often avoid repeating moves immediately and may follow simple patterns.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given the psychological bias toward rock for first moves by beginners, playing paper would give us the highest expected value for this round. If the opponent chooses rock (highest probability), we win. If they choose scissors, we lose. If they choose paper, it's a tie. The risk-reward calculation favors paper as the optimal first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, all experts point toward paper being the optimal choice against a fresh player's likely first move of rock.

Common tendencies include: 1) Starting with rock (most intuitive/aggressive), 2) Avoiding scissors initially (seems \"weakest\"), 3) Following cultural biases (rock = strength).

However, we should be prepared that this is just our first move in what might be multiple rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with paper as the opening move. Fresh players often start with rock due to its perceived strength and simplicity.

This makes you unpredictable and ensures you can't be exploited by opponents who try to find patterns in your play. However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" there might be exploitable tendencies.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players often have predictable patterns. Research shows that beginners tend to:\n1. Start with rock more frequently (around 35-40% of the time) - it's the most \"aggressive\" feeling choice\n2. Avoid scissors initially as it feels \"weakest\"  \n3. Follow common psychological biases like avoiding the same move twice in a row early on\n\nGiven this is the very first move against a fresh player, I'd recommend playing paper to counter the likely rock opening.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Both perspectives are valuable. The Game Theorist suggests pure randomization for long-term optimal play, while the Psychology Expert identifies that fresh players statistically favor rock on opening moves. Since this is specifically mentioned as a \"fresh player\" and it's our first interaction, I think exploiting the psychological tendency makes sense here. Let me go with paper to counter the expected rock.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a reasonable approach for the opening move. Just remember that if we continue playing multiple rounds, we should track the opponent's patterns and potentially revert to more randomized play if they adapt or if they don't follow the typical fresh player patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they tend to start with rock more frequently, or they might choose based on what feels \"strong\" to them.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** You're absolutely right about behavioral patterns. Research shows that inexperienced players have several tendencies: (1) They favor rock as their first move about 35% of the time, (2) They often avoid repeating the same move consecutively, and (3) They tend to play the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move.
