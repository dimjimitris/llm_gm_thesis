According to these rules:\n- paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- rock beats paper \n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis is different from the usual game. So when I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won because paper beats scissors according to these rules.\n\nNow for the next move, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They played scissors in the first round and lost. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to rock (which beats paper)\n3. Switch to paper (which would tie with paper)\n\nSince they're a \"fresh player\" they might not have a complex strategy yet. I should consider what move gives me the best expected outcome. If I assume they might switch to rock after losing with scissors, then I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock). But if they stick with scissors, then I should play paper again.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors this time, betting that they might switch to rock after their loss.",

Paper should lose to scissors. But the system is telling me I won, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something or there's an error. I'll trust the system feedback.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I should lose since rock beats scissors, but again the system says I won)\n\nWait, let me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo actually:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I should win. That matches what happened.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I should win. That also matches.\n\nSo the opponent has played scissors, then rock. If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next.

But scissors beats paper, so this seems wrong. Let me check the rules again.\n\nThe rules say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, this is backwards from normal rock-paper-scissors! In this version:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo in Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won because paper beats scissors in this game.\n\nLet me trace through all rounds:\nRound 1: Me=paper, Opponent=scissors \u2192 I win (paper beats scissors)\nRound 2: Me=scissors, Opponent=rock \u2192 I win (scissors beats rock)  \nRound 3: Me=rock, Opponent=paper \u2192 I win (rock beats paper)\nRound 4: Me=rock, Opponent=scissors \u2192 I lost (scissors beats rock)\n\nSo the opponent's sequence was: scissors, rock, paper, scissors\n\nThat's not a clear pattern. Let me think about what to play next. The opponent has played scissors twice now (rounds 1 and 4), rock once (round 2), and paper once (round 3). \n\nIf I'm trying to predict, there's no clear pattern yet. I should probably just make a strategic choice. Since scissors beats rock, and rock beats paper, and paper beats scissors, I need to guess what they'll play.\n\nGiven that they just played scissors in round 4, they might switch to something else. I'll go with paper to beat scissors in case they repeat, or I could go with rock to beat paper if they switch to paper.\n \nI'm strategically selecting paper, anticipating the opponent might replay scissors or switch to another move that paper can counter.",
