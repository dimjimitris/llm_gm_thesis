    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often default to rock as their first choice since it's commonly the first option people think of.\n\n3. If I play paper and they play rock, I get the maximum reward of +3 points.\n\n4. Even if I'm wrong, the risk is manageable - worst case is losing 1 point if they play scissors, or tying if they play paper.\n\n5. The potential high reward (+3) outweighs the risk, making paper the optimal strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] paper"

In round 2, the other player might:\n   - Repeat paper (some players stick with ties)\n   - Play scissors to counter my expected repeat of paper\n   - Switch to rock as an alternative\n\n3. If they expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors, then rock would beat their scissors and give me 1 point.\n\n4. If they stick with paper, my rock loses 3 points - but this seems less likely given the tie.\n\n5. If they play rock, we tie for 0 points.\n\n6. The most logical counter-play after a paper-paper tie would be scissors (to beat expected repeat paper), so rock is my best strategic response.\n\n[move] rock"
