According to the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBut the hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points.\" This seems inconsistent - if I made paper and opponent made scissors, then scissors should beat paper, not the other way around.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo paper beats scissors. I made paper, opponent made scissors. So I should win and get 1 point. That matches what the hint said. Good.\n\nNow for the next round. My opponent just played scissors. I need to think about what they might play next. There's no clear pattern from just one move, so I should think strategically about the payoff matrix:\n\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point  \n- If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie, 0 points\n\nThe highest reward is 3 points for paper beating rock. The highest penalty is -3 points for rock losing to paper. So paper is high reward but also puts me at risk if they play scissors. Rock is potentially high penalty but safe against paper.\n \nI'll choose rock to counter their previous scissors move, minimizing potential point loss while keeping a strategic advantage.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

But if they stick with scissors, I should play rock to beat it. If they go with paper, I should play rock.\n\nSince rock beats paper (3 points) and rock beats scissors (wait no, scissors beats rock), let me be more careful:\n- If opponent plays rock: I should play rock for tie or paper for -3 points to me\n- If opponent plays paper: I should play rock for +3 points to me  \n- If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock for -1 points to me (scissors beats rock)\n \nI see a strategic opportunity to maximize points by carefully selecting my moves. The key is to anticipate the opponent's pattern and choose moves that give me the highest point potential. With the recurring scissors move, I need to be strategic about when to play rock or paper to gain an advantage.\n\nPlaying paper could potentially catch another scissors move, earning me points while minimizing risk. This approach balances potential point gain with strategic positioning in the game.",
