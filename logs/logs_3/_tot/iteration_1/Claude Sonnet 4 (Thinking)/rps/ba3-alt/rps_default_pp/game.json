Scissors and paper both have moderate rewards (+1) and penalties (-1).\n\nFor this round, I could:\n1. Stick with rock - high risk, high reward\n2. Switch to paper - beats scissors if they repeat\n3. Switch to scissors - beats rock if they think I'll switch to rock\n\nGiven that they played scissors last time, if they think I might stick with rock or go back to rock, they might play scissors again. If they think I'll switch to paper to counter their scissors, they might play rock.\n\nI think I'll go with paper this time, as it would beat scissors if they repeat their previous move, and the risk/reward is more balanced.",
