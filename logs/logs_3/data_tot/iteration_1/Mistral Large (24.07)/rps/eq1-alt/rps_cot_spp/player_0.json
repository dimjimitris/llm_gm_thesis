    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opponent\u2019s potential moves:\n   - If the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a defined strategy yet.\n   - There is no prior information on the opponent's preferences, so I should start with a balanced approach.\n\n3. Balanced opening move:\n   - Choosing any of the moves initially is equally valid since there is no historical data to base a decision on.\n   - Random choice between paper, rock, and scissors can be a good starting point to gather information on the opponent's strategy.\n\nSince there is no preference indicated, I will start with rock, as it is a common and neutral starting move.\n\n[move] Rock, since it is a balanced and neutral starting move.\n"

In this case, I should choose paper to counter their potential strategy.\n\n5. **Make a Decision Based on Probability and Anticipation:**\n   - Since I won the last round with rock, the opponent might try to switch to a move that beats rock (paper). Therefore, choosing scissors is a strong move.\n   - I'll consider both possibilities and choose the move that offers the best chance of winning based on likely opponent strategies.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nGiven the analysis, choosing paper would counter the opponent if they switched to rock anticipating scissors. However, scissors is a strong choice if the opponent repeats paper.\n\nConsidering the balance and potential strategies, I will choose:\n\n[move] Scissors, anticipating the opponent might repeat their paper move or switch to rock.\n"
