Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

        "Sure, let's think through this step-by-step to formulate a strategy.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Identify the possible moves and their outcomes:\n     - Paper beats Scissors (wins +1 point, loses -1 point)\n     - Rock beats Paper (wins +1 point, loses -1 point)\n     - Scissors beats Rock (wins +1 point, loses -1 point)\n     - Same move results in a tie (no points).\n\n2. **Strategy Consideration**:\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, their move may be random or based on minimal strategic knowledge.\n   - A common strategy is to assume a 1/3 chance for each move (paper, rock, scissors) due to lack of prior knowledge.\n\n3. **Optimal Move Selection**:\n   - Without additional information, each move has an equal probability of success.\n   - Choosing any move would be equally valid, but for a fresh start, choosing a move that has a neutral outcome can be a safe choice.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will start by choosing \"rock\" as it is a common and balanced choice.\n\n[move] Rock (Balanced choice to start with against a fresh player with unknown strategy)\n",
        "[move] (Starting with a common choice that has equal chances against others) Rock\n",
        "**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the possible outcomes**:\n   - paper vs. rock: lose 1 point\n   - paper vs. scissors: win 1 point\n   - paper vs. paper: tie (0 points)\n   - rock vs. paper: win 1 point\n   - rock vs. scissors: lose 1 point\n   - rock vs. rock: tie (0 points)\n   - scissors vs. paper: lose 1 point\n   - scissors vs. rock: win 1 point\n   - scissors vs. scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n2. **Consider the opponent's potential strategy**: Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a developed strategy. They could choose any of the three moves with equal probability.\n\n3. **Determine the optimal move**: Given that each move has an equal chance of being chosen by the opponent, my first move should aim to minimize loss or maximize gain. In this case, all moves have an equal chance of winning or losing.\n\n4. **Make a move**: I will choose 'paper' for my first move as it has the same chances of winning or losing as any other initial move.\n\n**Final decision**:\n[move] paper (As a starting move, paper has an equal chance of winning or losing, and it's a common opening choice in Rock-Paper-Scissors.)\n",
        "To approach this Rock-Paper-Scissors game strategically, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors.\n   - Scissors beat Paper.\n   - Paper beats Rock.\n   - Tie: no points.\n\n2. **Initial Move**: Without any prior knowledge of the opponent's strategy, start with a balanced approach.\n\n3. **Adaptive Strategy**: Try to predict the opponent's next move based on their previous moves. If they choose Rock, they might switch to Paper next. If they choose Paper, they might switch to Scissors, and so on.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Aim to minimize losses. If uncertain, choose a move that could potentially tie rather than lose.\n\n5. **Randomization**: Occasionally make random moves to avoid being predictable.\n\nApplying these steps, for the first move against a fresh player (no history to base a decision on):\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper as an initial balanced move)\n",
        "Steps:\n\n1. Understand the game rules and the payoff matrix: paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper. A win gives 1 point, a loss gives -1 points, and a tie gives 0 points.\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or preferences.\n3. In the absence of information, I'll start with a random move to gain insight into the opponent's strategy.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] rock (As a starting move to gather information about the opponent's strategy)\n"
