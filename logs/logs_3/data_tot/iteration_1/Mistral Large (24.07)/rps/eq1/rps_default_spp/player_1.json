    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This prevents your opponent from easily predicting your next move. Let's start with rock, as it's a common move and can help gauge the opponent's approach.\n\n**Historical Analyst**: Since this is the first move, we don't have any historical data to evaluate. Let's go with the strategist's initial suggestion and observe the opponent's response.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] Rock\n\n---\n\n*Assuming you play Rock and the opponent plays Paper*\n\n**Game Strategist**: We lost the first round. The opponent chose paper, which beats rock. Let's try to counter their next move. Paper loses to scissors. Playing scissors might trick them into thinking we're adapting straightforwardly.\n\n**Historical Analyst**: Given the opponent played paper in the first round, there's a chance they might repeat or switch to rock to avoid a tie. Let's apply the counter strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] Scissors\n\n---\n\n*Assuming you play Scissors and the opponent plays Rock*\n\n**Game Strategist**: Excellent, we won that round. Now, the opponent may try to counter your scissors with rock again or switch to paper. Let's go with paper to be safe and see if they fall into a predictable pattern.\n\n**Historical Analyst**: Based on the pattern so far, the opponent seems to be switching moves. Playing paper now could disrupt any developing strategy they might have.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] Paper\n\n---\n\n*Assuming you play Paper and the opponent plays Scissors*\n\n**Game Strategist**: We lost this round. It seems the opponent is adapting quickly. Let's switch back to rock to catch them off guard, as they might expect another switch or a repeat.\n\n**Historical Analyst**: The pattern suggests the opponent might go with rock next, so playing rock or scissors is risky. Rock is more unpredictable at this stage, given our previous losses.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] Rock\n\n---\n\n*Assuming you play Rock and the opponent plays Paper again*\n\n**Game Strategist**: The opponent seems to favor paper. Let's stick with scissors to counter this tendency and see if they continue to be predictable.\n\n**Historical Analyst**: The opponent's preference for paper is evident. Sticking with scissors can exploit this pattern and boost our score.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: [move] Scissors\n\n---\n\nContinue this multi-round collaboration process, adjusting your moves based on the opponent's behavior and the insights from the Game Strategist and Historical Analyst.\n\n### Finish Collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Keep adapting based on the opponent's moves and patterns observed by the Historical Analyst, guided by the Game Strategist's tactical advice.\n"
