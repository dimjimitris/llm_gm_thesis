He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests the opponent may not have a predefined strategy or may choose moves randomly.\n\n3. **Optimal Move Selection:**\n   - Given the lack of information about the opponent's strategy, aiming to start with a balanced move can be advantageous.\n   - Choosing a move that has a 50% chance of winning or tying (assuming random play from the opponent) can be a good initial strategy.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   - Since there's no clear advantage to starting with any particular move and all moves are equally likely to win, lose, or tie against a random play, go with a move that is simple and straightforward.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] Rock (Starting with a common and straightforward move to gauge the opponent's response.)\n\nBy starting with \"Rock,\" I can observe the opponent's response and adjust my strategy in future rounds based on the outcome.

However, they might start with a common move like Rock.\n\n3. **Consider Probabilities:**\n   - Assuming a uniform distribution, each move has an equal probability of 1/3.\n   - Randomizing your move can be a starting strategy until more information is gathered about the opponent's tendencies.\n\n4. **Initial Move:**\n   - Since there is no historical data to base a decision on, a random move is a reasonable starting point.\n   - Given the common tendency of new players to choose Rock, choosing Paper gives a higher probability of gaining points if the opponent chooses Rock.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper to maximize potential gains against a new player who might commonly choose Rock.)\n",

In this case, the opponent might switch to Paper.\n\n3. **Potential Moves and Outcomes**:\n   - If I choose Rock:\n     - It ties if the opponent chooses Rock.\n     - It loses to Paper.\n   - If I choose Paper:\n     - It ties if the opponent chooses Paper.\n     - It loses to Scissors.\n   - If I choose Scissors:\n     - It beats Paper.\n     - It loses to Rock.\n\n4. **Strategize**:\n   - Anticipating the opponent might switch to Paper, choosing Scissors is a strategic move to potentially win this round.\n\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating the opponent might switch to Paper after the tie)\n",
