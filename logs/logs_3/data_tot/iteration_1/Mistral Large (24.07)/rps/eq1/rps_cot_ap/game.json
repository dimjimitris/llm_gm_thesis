Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

        "Sure, let's think through the steps to maximize points in this game of rock, paper, scissors.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Understand the game dynamics.\n   - Rock beats scissors.\n   - Paper beats rock.\n   - Scissors beat paper.\n   - Ties result in no points.\n\n2. Consider opponent's potential moves.\n   - A fresh player might throw any move with equal probability.\n\n3. Strategize based on available information.\n   - There's no immediate advantage in choosing any particular move without knowledge of the opponent's strategy.\n   - Opting for a balanced approach by randomizing moves can prevent predictability.\n\n4. Make a move.\n   - Since there\u2019s no prior information, I'll start with a balanced choice.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (Balanced choice to start) rock\n",
        "To maximize my points and minimize penalties, I need to strategize based on what my opponent is likely to do. Since this is a fresh player and I don't have any historical data, I'll start with a common and balanced approach.\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n2. Consider the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors.\n   - Paper beats rock.\n   - Scissors beats paper.\n3. Choose an initial move that is neutral and common. Since many players might start with \"rock,\" I'll counter with \"paper\" as a reasonable first strategy.\n\nFinal decision: paper\n\n[move] paper (Starting with a neutral and common strategy to counter a potential rock move.)\n",
