    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "To maximize points and minimize penalties in the next round, let's think through the steps:\n\n### Steps to Decide the Next Move\n\n1. **Review Previous Rounds:**\n   - In the last round, I lost by playing rock against the opponent's paper, scoring -1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Potential Next Move:**\n   - The opponent played paper last time. Possible strategies they might adopt:\n     - Switch to **scissors**, expecting me to play rock again.\n     - Switch to **rock**, expecting me to play scissors to counter their paper.\n     - Play **paper** again, thinking I might switch to rock or scissors.\n\n3. **Formulate a Strategy Based on Potential Moves:**\n   - If I play **rock** again:\n     - Win if the opponent plays scissors.\n     - Lose if the opponent plays paper.\n     - Tie if the opponent plays rock.\n   - If I play **scissors**:\n     - Win if the opponent plays paper.\n     - Lose if the opponent plays rock.\n     - Tie if the opponent plays scissors.\n   - If I play **paper**:\n     - Win if the opponent plays rock.\n     - Lose if the opponent plays scissors.\n     - Tie if the opponent plays paper.\n\n4. **Choose the Best Move:**\n   - Considering the opponent's potential strategies, playing **scissors** seems strategic:\n     - It could result in a win if the opponent plays paper.\n     - It ties if the opponent also plays scissors, which is neutral.\n     - The risk of the opponent playing rock is present, but given the past patterns, this move maximizes the chance of avoiding a loss while potentially gaining points.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n[move] (Choosing scissors to potentially counter the opponent's paper or tie with scissors, aiming to maximize points or avoid a loss) Scissors\n"
