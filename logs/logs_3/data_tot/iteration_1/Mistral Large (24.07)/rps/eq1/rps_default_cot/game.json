A tie gives no points, a win gives 1 point, and a loss gives -1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent**: The hint mentions that I am playing against a fresh player. This could mean they are new and might not have a set strategy, or they could be unpredictable.\n\n3. **Probability Consideration**: Since it's the first move and there's no historical data on the opponent's behavior, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of being chosen by the opponent.\n\n4. **Strategy Formulation**: Given no prior knowledge of the opponent's strategy, a reasonable approach is to start with a random move. This provides a baseline for future strategic adjustments based on the opponent's response.\n\n5. **Make a Move**: I'll choose 'rock' as my first move. It's a common starting move and will help set a baseline for future strategy adjustments.\n\nFinal decision:\n```\n[move] Rock (Starting with a common move to establish a baseline)\n```\n"
