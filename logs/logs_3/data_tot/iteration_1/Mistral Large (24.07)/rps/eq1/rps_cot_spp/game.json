Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

However, commonly, new players might choose rock as a default option.\n4. **Maximize Points / Minimize Penalties**: Given the lack of information, aim to make a move that minimizes potential losses.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- If the opponent is likely to choose rock as a default option, choosing paper could maximize the chance of winning.\n- Choosing rock or scissors could result in a tie or a loss depending on the opponent's choice.\n- Since there's no prior information about the opponent's preference, choosing paper is a strategic move that offers a balanced risk-reward scenario.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI will choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper seems like a good initial move against a fresh player, considering common starting strategies.

It's possible they may switch strategies or choose a different move this time.\n\n3. **Common Strategic Responses**:\n   - After losing with Rock, an opponent might switching to Paper (as it beats Rock, which lost last time).\n   - Or, they might switch to Scissors to try something different.\n\n4. **Optimal Move Selection**:\n   - If the opponent switches to Paper, choosing Scissors would beat Paper.\n   - If the opponent switches to Scissors, choosing Rock would beat Scissors.\n   - Choosing Rock could also be a safe choice if the opponent sticks with Rock or switches to Scissors.\n\n5. **Assess Risks and Rewards**:\n   - Rock is a strong move if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n   - Paper might be chosen again by the opponent, so Scissors can be a counter move.\n\n6. **Make the Move**:\n   - Given the slightly greater chance that the opponent might switch to Paper, I'll choose Scissors.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating a switch to Paper by the opponent)\n",
