Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

        "To strategize effectively, I'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the payoff matrix:\n   - rock beats scissors: +1 point for rock, -1 point for scissors.\n   - paper beats rock: +1 point for paper, -1 point for rock.\n   - scissors beats paper: +1 point for scissors, -1 point for paper.\n   - Tie: no points awarded.\n\n2. Since this is the first round and there's no historical data on the opponent's play style, I'll start with a neutral move.\n\n3. Choosing a neutral move:\n   - There's no clear advantage to any initial move, so I'll choose 'paper' as it is statistically neutral and commonly played.\n\n[move] Paper (Starting with a neutral and commonly played move to gain initial insight into the opponent's strategy)\n",
        "To maximize my points and minimize penalties, I need to strategize based on the possible outcomes of the game. Here are the steps to decide on my move:\n\n1. Understand the basic rules and outcomes:\n   - Rock beats Scissors.\n   - Paper beats Rock.\n   - Scissors beats Paper.\n   - Identical moves result in a tie.\n\n2. Consider that the opponent is a fresh player, so their strategy might be simple or random.\n\n3. Analyze potential moves:\n   - If I choose Rock, I win if the opponent chooses Scissors, lose if they choose Paper, and tie if they choose Rock.\n   - If I choose Paper, I win if the opponent chooses Rock, lose if they choose Scissors, and tie if they choose Paper.\n   - If I choose Scissors, I win if the opponent chooses Paper, lose if they choose Rock, and tie if they choose Scissors.\n\n4. Given the uncertainty about the opponent's move, it might be beneficial to start with a neutral choice that has a balanced chance of winning or losing, rather than a move that definitively loses to a specific choice.\n\n5. Since the outcome for any move is uncertain, starting with Paper is a reasonable choice as it can beat Rock, which could be a common initial move for a new player.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Paper (Starting with Paper as it can beat Rock, which a new player might commonly choose initially.)\n",
