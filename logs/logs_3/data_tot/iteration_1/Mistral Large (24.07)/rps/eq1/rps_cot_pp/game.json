Since the opponent is fresh, they might not have a established pattern or strategy yet.\n\n2. **Consider Psychological Factors**: New players might tend to choose 'rock' as their first move, as it's often perceived as a strong or default choice.\n\n3. **Optimal First Move**: Given the above consideration, choosing 'paper' could give me an advantage. If the opponent chooses 'rock', I win. If they choose 'scissors', I lose, but if they choose 'paper', it's a tie. So, there's a higher chance of not losing.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] I choose 'paper' as it has a higher probability of winning or drawing against a fresh player.\n"

This assumption can be based on common behavior observed in new players.\n\n3. **Choose 'Paper'**: Since 'paper' defeats 'rock', and 'paper' only loses to 'scissors', choosing 'paper' gives me a higher probability of winning or at least not losing if the opponent also chooses 'paper'.\n\nTherefore, my move will be:\n[move] (Since it is a common behavior for new players to start with 'rock', choosing 'paper' increases my chance of securing a win or at least a tie.) paper\n"

        "To strategically approach the game and maximize my points, here are the steps I will take:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**: The game involves three possible moves (rock, paper, scissors) with a specific outcome for each combination. Knowing the payoff matrix is crucial:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: \\(+1\\) points for the winner, \\(-1\\) for the loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: \\(+1\\) points for the winner, \\(-1\\) for the loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: \\(+1\\) points for the winner, \\(-1\\) for the loser.\n   - Ties result in no points awarded.\n\n2. **Initial Strategy**: Assume the opponent might start with a typical choice, such as 'rock', which many novice players tend to use. This assumption can be based on common behavior observed in new players.\n\n3. **Choose 'Paper'**: Since 'paper' defeats 'rock', and 'paper' only loses to 'scissors', choosing 'paper' gives me a higher probability of winning or at least not losing if the opponent also chooses 'paper'.\n\nTherefore, my move will be:\n[move] (Since it is a common behavior for new players to start with 'rock', choosing 'paper' increases my chance of securing a win or at least a tie.) paper\n",
        "[move] (Starting with paper to have a fair chance of winning against a random move) paper\n",
        "### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rules**: I need to understand the rules of the game and the payoff matrix. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper. Wins give 1 point, losses give -1 point, and ties give 0 points.\n2. **Consider the Opponent**: This is a fresh player, so there is no prior history to analyze.\n3. **Randomize Initial Move**: Given the lack of information about the opponent's strategy, a good starting point is to make a random move. This avoids being predictable.\n4. **Choose a Move**: Randomly select one option from rock, paper, or scissors.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- Since there's no historical data on the opponent's moves, any initial move is equally likely to win, lose, or tie.\n- Randomizing the first move helps to avoid patterns that an opponent could exploit later.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Rock (Choosing rock as my initial random move)\n\nLet's proceed with the game.\n",

It's neither too aggressive nor too passive.\n- This allows me to understand the opponent's initial choice and adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n\n[move] Rock (Starting with a common choice to understand the opponent's approach)\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n",
