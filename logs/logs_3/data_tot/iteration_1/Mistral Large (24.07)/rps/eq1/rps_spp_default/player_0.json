    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n**Statistician**: Without any data from previous moves, each move has a 1/3 probability of being chosen by the opponent. Therefore, choosing any move gives you an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n**Psychologist**: New players might start with a rock, as it's often perceived as the strongest move initially. However, this is a common bias and not a certainty.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the input from all personas, I'll choose paper to potentially counter a rock if the opponent falls into the common bias.\n\n```\n[move] I choose paper, aiming to counter the opponent's potential rock.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Round 2\n\n[Assume you receive feedback from the first round where the opponent chose rock and you won with paper.]\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent chose rock last time, which you successfully countered with paper.

They might choose scissors now.\n\n**Statistician**: With two consecutive wins using strategic countermoves, the opponent is likely to choose scissors to counter your previous scissors.\n\n**Psychologist**: The opponent might continue to adapt to your moves, so scissors is a likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the trend, I'll choose rock to counter the opponent's potential scissors.\n\n```\n[move] I choose rock, expecting the opponent will choose scissors.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Continue this process...\n\nFor each subsequent round, continue to analyze the opponent's moves, listen to the personas, and make strategic decisions based on the patterns and insights provided.\n\n### Summary\n\nBy collaborating with a Game Theorist, Statistician, and Psychologist, you can make strategic moves that maximize your points and minimize penalties, adapting to the opponent's moves and patterns effectively.\n\n```\n[move] I choose [your move based on analysis].\n```\n"
