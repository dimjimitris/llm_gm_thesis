Understanding the payoff matrix is crucial. Given that you are playing against a fresh player, it\u2019s often a good idea to start with a neutral move like rock. Rocks tend to be a balanced option and might confuse the opponent a bit.\n\nAdvisor: Remember, every move has its own risk and reward. Starting with rock might give you an edge if the opponent plays scissors, but it can also lead to a tie if they choose rock too. However, starting aggressively with scissors might lead to a quick win or loss. Balance is key in the first round.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.
