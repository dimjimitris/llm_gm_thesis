        "To strategize for this game of rock, paper, scissors, let's follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the fundamental rules\n- Rock beats Scissors (+1 point for Rock, -1 for Scissors)\n- Paper beats Rock (+1 point for Paper, -1 for Rock)\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1 point for Scissors, -1 for Paper)\n- Same move results in a tie (0 points for both players)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the hint for clues\n- The hint states: \"You are playing against a fresh player.\"\n- This suggests that the player is new or has no established pattern to discern from previous moves.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate a strategy based on the new player assumption\n- New players often have simple or straightforward strategies.\n- A common intuition might be to start with Rock, as it's often chosen by new players to appear strong.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the best countermove\n- If the new player is likely to choose Rock, the best countermove is Paper.\n\n### Step 5: Make the move\n- Based on the above reasoning, I will choose Paper.\n\n### Move\n[move] Paper (New players often choose Rock first, so Paper is a strategic choice against a fresh player.)\n\n### Final Decision: Paper\n",
