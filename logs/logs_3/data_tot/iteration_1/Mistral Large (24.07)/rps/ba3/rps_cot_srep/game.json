Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "Alright, let's strategize and make a move.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. This is the first round, and I'm playing against a fresh player. I have no information about their strategy or preferences yet.\n2. The safest bet is to choose a move that has a chance to win and minimize loss if I lose.\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, if I lose with rock or scissors, I lose 1 point. But if I lose with paper, I lose 3 points.\n4. Therefore, to minimize potential loss, I should choose either rock or scissors.\n5. For the first move, I'll choose rock as it's a common choice and might give me a psychological advantage.\n\n[move] Rock (Choosing rock as it's a common choice and minimizes potential loss)\n",

        "Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**: Recognize that rock, paper, and scissors have different point values and penalties.\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\n2. **Identify the Risk-Reward Ratios**:\n   - Choosing rock or scissors has a lower risk (lose 1 point) but also lower reward (gain 1 point).\n   - Choosing paper has a higher risk (lose 3 points) but also higher reward (gain 3 points).\n\n3. **Analyze the Opponent**: Since the opponent is a fresh player, there's no historical data to predict their move. Assume they might start with a common choice like rock.\n\n4. **Decide Based on First Impression**: Given the higher reward and assuming the opponent might choose rock, paper is a strategic first move.\n\nFinal Decision:\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing paper due to its high reward potential and the assumption that a fresh player might start with rock.)\n",

Consider that I have no prior knowledge about my opponent's strategy or past moves.\n\n3. To maximize points and minimize penalties, I should consider the potential gains and losses for each move:\n   - Choosing rock: can win 1 point, can lose 3 points.\n   - Choosing paper: can win 3 points, can lose 1 point.\n   - Choosing scissors: can win 1 point, can lose 1 point.\n\n4.

They could choose any of the three moves with equal probability.\n\n3. **Evaluate my options**:\n   - If I choose Rock: I could win 1 point, lose 3 points, or draw.\n   - If I choose Paper: I could win 1 point, lose 1 point, or draw.\n   - If I choose Scissors: I could win 1 point, lose 1 point, or draw.\n\n4. **Minimize risk**: To minimize potential penalties, I should avoid the move that could result in the highest loss, which is choosing Rock and potentially losing 3 points if the opponent chooses Paper.\n\n5. **Maximize potential gain**: Between Paper and Scissors, the potential gain is the same (1 point), but the potential loss is different. Losing with Paper results in -1 point, while losing with Scissors results in -1 point.
