    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I'll take to decide my move:\n\n1. **Understand the payoff matrix**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 for loser.\n   - Tie: No points awarded.\n\n2. **Consider the fresh player's potential strategy**: Since this is a fresh player, they might not have a established strategy. They could choose any move randomly.\n\n3. **Evaluate my options**:\n   - If I choose Rock, I could gain 1 point if the opponent chooses Scissors, but lose 3 points if they choose Paper.\n   - If I choose Paper, I could gain 3 points if the opponent chooses Rock, but lose 1 point if they choose Scissors.\n   - If I choose Scissors, I could gain 1 point if the opponent chooses Paper, but lose 1 point if they choose Rock.\n\n4. **Minimize potential loss**: Given that the opponent's move is unpredictable, I should prioritize minimizing my potential loss. The maximum loss with Rock or Scissors is 1 point, while with Paper, it's 3 points.\n\n5. **Maximize potential gain**: Between Rock and Scissors, the potential gain is the same (1 point). However, statistically, new players might be more inclined to choose Rock as their first move.\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] Scissors (Choosing Scissors to minimize potential loss and potentially gain a point if the opponent chooses Paper.)\n"
