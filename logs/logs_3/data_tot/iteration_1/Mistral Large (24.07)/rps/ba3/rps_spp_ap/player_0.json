    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

AI Assistant (you)\n2. Strategy Analyst\n3. Game Theory Expert\n\n### Round 1\n**AI Assistant (you):** \"Let's start by analyzing the situation. We are playing against a fresh player who might not have a set strategy. We can use a basic approach to gauge their response.\"\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** \"Given that the opponent is fresh, let's start with a balanced move. The first move can be 'rock' as it's the most straightforward and commonly chosen move.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** \"Given the payoff matrix, 'rock' is a neutral choice but effective for understanding the opponent's next moves. It\u2019s a good starting point considering the unpredictability of the opponent.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** \"[move] Rock (Starting with a balanced move to gauge the opponent's strategy)\"\n\n[Hold for opponent's move description]\n\n### Round 2 (based on opponent's move)\nSuppose the opponent played 'scissors'.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** \"The opponent played 'scissors'. This means you won the round and got 1 point. The opponent might change their strategy after losing to 'rock'. Let's go for 'paper' next as it counters the 'rock' you played and also 'rock' that the opponent might play next.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** \"Considering the opponent might try 'rock' to counter your previous move, playing 'paper' is a strong tactical choice to maximize points.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** \"[move] Paper (Anticipating the opponent might switch to 'rock')\"\n\n[Hold for opponent's move description]\n\n### Round 3 (continuing the strategy)\nSuppose the opponent played 'rock'.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** \"The opponent played 'rock', and you played 'paper', netting you 3 points. The opponent is likely to switch to 'scissors' next to counter your 'paper'.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** \"Anticipating the switch to 'scissors', you should play 'rock' to counter their move effectively, thus continuing the tactical advantage.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** \"[move] Rock (Anticipating the opponent might switch to 'scissors')\"\n\n[Hold for opponent's move description]\n\n### Concluding Strategy\n**Strategy Analyst:** \"Keep monitoring the opponent's patterns and adapting your moves accordingly. This dynamic strategy maximizes your points.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** \"Stay a step ahead by predicting the opponent's likely responses based on previous rounds. Use the payoff matrix effectively to maximize your points.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** \"Thanks for the strategic advice. Let's continue with anticipatory moves and adapt as needed.\"\n\n---\n\n**Final decision** for continuous rounds: Adapt moves based on the opponent's pattern and the payoff matrix to maximize points.\n\n---\n\nThis structured collaboration ensures a strategic and adaptive approach to the game, maximizing points and minimizing penalties based on evolving opponent moves.\n"
