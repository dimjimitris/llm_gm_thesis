Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "Let's approach this step-by-step to maximize our points and minimize penalties.\n\n### Steps to Winning Strategy:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Tie: 0 points for both players\n\n2. **Initial Strategy Analysis:**\n   - Since we are playing against a fresh player, assume the opponent might choose moves randomly or without a clear strategy.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - If the opponent chooses randomly, there is an equal chance for each move.\n   - To maximize points, favor moves with higher rewards (Paper).\n   - To minimize penalties, avoid moves with higher penalties (Rock when opponent chooses Paper).\n\n4. **First Move:**\n   - Choosing Paper gives the highest reward if the opponent chooses Rock.\n   - It also is neutral if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n   - It avoids the situation where an opponent's Paper choice would give a -3 penalty.\n\n### Final Decision and Move:\n\n[move] Paper. This move maximizes potential reward and minimizes risk in this round.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the initial analysis, choosing Paper seems the best strategic move to start with against a fresh player.\n",
        "Alright, let's strategize step-by-step for the first move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Tie: No points awarded.\n\n2. **Initial Consideration**:\n   - The opponent is a fresh player, so there's no historical data to consider.\n   - Without any prior knowledge, each move (Rock, Paper, Scissors) has an equal chance of being chosen by the opponent.\n\n3. **Analyze Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing Rock: Risks losing to Paper (-3 points), gains if opponent chooses Scissors (+1 point).\n   - Choosing Paper: Risks losing to Scissors (-1 point), gains if opponent chooses Rock (+3 points).\n   - Choosing Scissors: Risks losing to Rock (-1 point), gains if opponent chooses Paper (+1 point).\n\n4. **Decision Making**:\n   - Given the higher penalty for choosing Rock and losing to Paper, it might be safer to avoid Rock initially.\n   - Choosing Paper gives a higher reward (+3 points) if the opponent chooses Rock, with a lower penalty if losing (-1 point).\n   - Choosing Scissors has lower gains and penalties compared to Paper.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - Considering the reward-risk balance, choosing Paper provides a good balance with a potential for high reward and a manageable penalty.\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper as it has a high reward potential with a manageable risk) Your move here\n",
