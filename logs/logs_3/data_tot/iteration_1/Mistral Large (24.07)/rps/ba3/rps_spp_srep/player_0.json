    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move has a different reward and penalty associated with it. Paper gives the highest reward but also the highest penalty. Therefore, a balanced approach is required. You might want to start with a 'rock' move, which is generally a neutral starting point and could provide insights into the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Psychologist**: New players often start with 'rock' due to its perceived strength. Therefore, 'paper' might be a high-reward move initially if the opponent is inexperienced.\n\n**Game Theorist**: In game theory, choosing randomly or mixing your strategies could prevent your opponent from predicting your moves. However, for the first move, choosing 'paper' might be optimal given the high potential reward.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Given the insights, I will start with 'paper' to potentially maximize the reward against a likely 'rock' move from the opponent.\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing paper for the first move as it has the potential to give the highest reward if the opponent chooses rock)\n\n---\n\nPlease make your move accordingly and await the outcome before proceeding to the next round of collaboration.\n"

'Scissors' beats 'paper', so anticipating this, we could switch to 'rock'. However, 'rock' could also be a predictable countermove.\n\n**Psychologist**: After a tie, players often switch to a different move. If they stick with 'paper', 'scissors' would be a winning move, but if they switch to 'rock' or 'scissors', 'paper' remains a high-risk, high-reward option.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Mixed strategies are key. If the opponent is savvy, they might anticipate 'rock' after 'paper'. Thus, a surprising move of 'scissors' could catch them off guard, especially if they switch to 'rock'.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Considering the insights, switching to 'scissors' seems like a strategic move to potentially gain points if the opponent switches from 'paper' to 'rock'.\n\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating opponent's switch from 'paper' to 'rock')\n"
