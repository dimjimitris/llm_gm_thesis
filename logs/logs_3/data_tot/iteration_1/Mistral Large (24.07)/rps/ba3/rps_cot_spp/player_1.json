    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Rock versus Paper is a riskier move because of the higher point differential. Let's start with a safe move; either rock or paper could be a good initial choice.\n\n**Risk Assessor:** Given that the opponent is a fresh player, they might make a standard opening move like rock. It's common for beginners. Playing paper could be a good counter because it\u2019s more likely to yield 3 points. However, consider the risk if they play scissors, which would result in -1 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Thanks for the insights. Considering the potential high reward and the likelihood of the opponent choosing rock, I will start with paper.\n\n[move] Playing paper to maximize potential gain versus a common opening move like rock. Paper wins over rock, giving me 3 points.\n\n---\n\n### Result (Hypothetical):\n**Opponent:** Rock\n**You:** Paper\n\n**Points:** You gain 3 points, opponent loses 3 points.\n\n---\n\n**Game Strategist:** Great, you won the first round. Now, since the opponent chose rock initially, they might switch to paper anticipating you would go for scissors. Let\u2019s be cautious and consider paper again since paper vs paper is a tie, and paper vs rock guarantees you 3 points again.\n\n**Risk Assessor:** Be aware, if the opponent chooses scissors in response to your last paper move, you\u2019ll lose 1 point. Playing rock this round might be safer, even though it may result in a tie if they choose rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Noted. Considering the strategic information, the opponent likely expects scissors. Let\u2019s go with rock for a safer outcome and potentially securing a win with scissors.\n\n[move] Playing rock. If the opponent chooses paper again, it\u2019s a tie; but if they go for scissors, this rounds out to a win for us.\n\n---\n\n### Result (Hypothetical):\n**Opponent:** Scissors\n**You:** Rock\n\n**Points:** You gain 1 point, opponent loses 1 point.\n\n---\n\n**Game Strategist:** Excellent! You've made a move and managed a win. The opponent might try to counter your rock with paper next. Let's switch to scissors to exploit this potential counter move.\n\n**Risk Assessor:** If they go for scissors again, likely trying to guess my choice, we\u2019ll tie. If they expect a shift to paper, we\u2019ll win. Let's stay on the safe side and go with paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Understood. Given the dynamic and the critical point state, let\u2019s play it safe and switch to a balance move - scissors.\n\n[move] Playing scissors. This balances our risk while maintaining the tension. If the opponent plays paper, we win!\n\n---\n\n### Result (Hypothetical):\n**Opponent:** Paper\n**You:** Scissors\n\n**Points:** You gain 1 point, opponent loses 1 point.\n\n---\n\n### Continue Collaboration as Needed...\n\nWith each round, the AI Assistant continues to collaborate with the Game Strategist and Risk Assessor, making moves that optimize points and minimize risks based on the opponent's probable actions and the game dynamics.\n"
