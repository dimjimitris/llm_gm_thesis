It offers a moderate gain against Paper and mitigates the risk of a loss to Scissors.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves or maintain their strategy.\n- Choosing Scissors offers a moderate gain (+1 point) if the opponent repeats Paper and mitigates the risk of a significant loss.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- [move] (Anticipating the opponent to switch to Scissors or repeat Paper) Scissors\n"
