    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I will consider:\n\n1. **Review Previous Rounds**:\n   - In the last round, I played Rock, and my opponent played Paper. I won the round and scored 3 points.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Strategy**:\n   - My opponent played Paper in the last round.\n   - They might expect me to repeat Rock or switch to Scissors to counter their Paper.\n\n3. **Consider the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent.\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points for me, -3 points for the opponent.\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent.\n   - Tie: 0 points for both players.\n\n4. **Strategize Based on Opponent's Likely Moves**:\n   - If the opponent expects me to play Rock again, they might switch to Scissors to beat Rock.\n   - If the opponent repeats Paper, playing Rock would give me 3 points.\n   - If the opponent anticipates Scissors, they might switch to Rock, in which case playing Paper would be beneficial.\n\n5. **Evaluate Risk and Reward**:\n   - Playing Rock: High reward (3 points) if the opponent plays Paper, but risky if they play Scissors.\n   - Playing Scissors: Moderate reward (1 point) if the opponent plays Rock, but risky if they play Paper.\n   - Playing Paper: Risky as it has a high penalty (-3 points) if the opponent plays Rock, but would beat Scissors.\n\n6. **Decision**:\n   - Given the opponent's potential strategy, playing Paper this round has a moderate reward if the opponent plays Rock and a high reward if they switch to Scissors.\n   - If they repeat Paper, it results in a tie, which is also acceptable.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Paper (Strategically playing Paper to potentially gain points if the opponent plays Rock or Scissors)\n"
