    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's break down the steps to maximize our points in this game of paper, rock, scissors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Mechanics**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 point for the winner, -1 for the loser).\n   - Paper beats Rock (+3 points for the winner, -3 for the loser).\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 point for the winner, -1 for the loser).\n   - Same move results in a tie (no points).\n\n2. **Initial Strategy Consideration**:\n   - Start by considering probabilities and potential outcomes.\n   - Since the other player is fresh, there might be an initial tendency to favor one move over the others.\n\n3. **Optimal Move Analysis**:\n   - Choosing a move that either secures a win or minimizes losses.\n   - Given the points system, winning with paper yields the highest reward (3 points), but it's also high risk (-3 points).\n   - Choosing rock or scissors offers less risk but also less reward.\n\n4. **Initial Move Decision**:\n   - Let\u2019s start with a balanced risk-reward move.\n   - Choosing 'rock' provides a good balance as it can win against scissors (+1) and tie against rock (0).\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Rock - Starting with a balanced risk-reward move to test the opponent's strategy.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, we make an informed decision based on the initial understanding of the game and the opponent's potential behavior. The next rounds will help in adjusting the strategy based on the opponent's moves.\n"

            "text": "Sure, let's break down the steps to maximize points in the next round of Paper, Rock, Scissors.\n\n### Steps to Maximize Points:\n\n1. **Review Past Moves**:\n   - In the previous round, both players chose 'rock', resulting in a tie (0 points).\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent\u2019s Strategy**:\n   - The opponent's last move was 'rock'. They might switch to 'paper' to counter a potential 'rock' from me or choose 'scissors' to avoid repeating 'rock'.\n\n3. **Consider Potential Moves**:\n   - If the opponent chooses 'paper', choosing 'scissors' would win +1 point.\n   - If the opponent chooses 'scissors', choosing 'rock' would win +1 point.\n   - If the opponent repeats 'rock', choosing 'paper' would win +3 points.\n\n4. **Risk-Reward Analysis**:\n   - Choosing 'paper' has the highest potential reward (+3 points) but carries a high risk (-3 points if the opponent chooses 'rock').\n   - Choosing 'scissors' offers a moderate reward (+1 point if they choose 'paper') but risks a loss (-1 point if they choose 'rock').\n   - Choosing 'rock' is safe against 'scissors' but risky against 'paper'.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - Given the opponent's potential moves, choosing 'scissors' is a strategic choice. It offers a moderate reward against 'paper' and mitigates the risk of a large loss if the opponent switches to 'rock'.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Scissors - Aiming to capitalize on the opponent's potential switch to 'paper' while maintaining a balanced risk-reward strategy.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, we make a strategic decision based on the opponent's past move and potential next move, aiming to maximize points while minimizing risk.\n"
