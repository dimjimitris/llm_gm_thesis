    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's think through this game systematically. Here are the steps to determine my move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 for the winner, -1 for the loser.\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 for the winner, -3 for the loser.\n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 for the winner, -1 for the loser.\n   - Tie: No points awarded.\n\n2. **Consider the Fresh Player Factor**:\n   - Since the player is fresh, they may not have a developed strategy.\n   - Fresh players might choose randomly or based on common intuition.\n\n3. **Assess Optimal Moves**:\n   - Paper has a moderate risk and reward (+1/-1 against scissors, -3 against rock).\n   - Rock has a high risk but also high reward (+3/-1 against paper and scissors respectively).\n   - Scissors has a low risk and reward (+1/-1 against rock, -1 against paper).\n\n4. **Evaluate Potential Opponent Strategy**:\n   - A fresh player might be less likely to choose rock due to its higher penalty of losing (-3).\n   - They might choose paper or scissors more frequently due to the lower penalties.\n\n5. **Make an Educated Guess**:\n   - To maximize points and minimize risk, playing rock could be beneficial. It has a chance to win +3 points, and the possible penalty (-1) is less than the potential gain.\n\n[move] Rock (Choosing rock as it offers a higher reward with a manageable risk against a fresh player who might avoid the high penalty associated with choosing rock themselves).\n\nFinal Decision: Move - Rock.\n"
