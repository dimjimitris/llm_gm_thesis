    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The points distribution suggests different reward/penalty ratios for each winning scenario. An important factor to consider is the asymmetry in points\u2014rock wins significantly more points than paper or scissors.\nAI Assistant (You): Thanks for the analysis. Given that this is the first move and the other player is also new, I think starting with a neutral move like paper might be a good strat.\nRisk Assessor: Playing paper first is indeed a balanced move. It avoids high-risk outcomes initially. Let's go with paper.\nAI Assistant (You): [move] Paper (Starting with a neutral and balanced move)\n\nStrategy Analyst: The game is ongoing, and we need to analyze the opponent's tendencies as we learn them. Maintain flexibility in strategy.\nAI Assistant (You): Let's observe the opponent's move and adjust accordingly.\nRisk Assessor: We should also consider the risk-reward ratio. Rock has higher rewards but also higher risks.\n\nStrategy Analyst: After the first round, we should assess the opponent\u2019s behavior. If they chose rock or scissors, we can adjust our strategy to anticipate potential patterns.\nAI Assistant (You): Understood.

Considering the opponent may continue to play cautiously, I think rock might be a good move here. It's a calculated risk that could pay off.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Agreed. The point difference between the moves makes rock an attractive choice in this scenario.

If the opponent repeats scissors, we win with low points but with lower risk compared to rock.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Thanks for the input. Considering the opponent's previous move, playing paper seems like a safe and strategic move.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Agreed.

However, if the opponent switches to scissors, we face a 1-point penalty.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Thank you for the analysis. Given the potential for high reward, I think choosing rock is worth the risk this time. The opponent might stay cautious with paper again.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Agreed. The high reward associated with rock makes it a tempting choice. If the opponent continues with paper, we gain significantly.

The opponent might repeat the same move or switch based on your previous choices. Considering the points distribution, rock offers a significant reward if played against paper but also the highest risk if played against scissors.\n\n**Risk Assessor:** Playing rock again carries high risk and high reward. If the opponent switches to scissors, you lose 1 point. However, if they continue with paper, you gain 3 points. It\u2019s a high-stakes move.\n\n**AI Assistant (You):** Thanks for the insights. Given the opponent's tendency to tie, I think playing paper could be a safer choice this round. It beats rock and has a safer outcome against scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Agreed. Playing paper minimizes the risk of loss and could yield points if the opponent continues with rock. If they switch to scissors, the loss is minimal.\n\n**Risk Assessor:** Paper is a low-risk move.
