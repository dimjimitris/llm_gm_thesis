Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since the opponent won with rock, they might choose it again or switch to paper to counter your potential scissors.\n**Psychologist**: The opponent might be feeling confident after winning with rock and could repeat the same move. However, if they are strategic, they might anticipate you choosing scissors and switch to paper.\n**Risk Analyst**: Choosing scissors against a potential rock would result in minimal loss (-1 point), but choosing paper against a potential rock would incur a significant loss (-3 points). Playing rock yourself could be a defensive move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the analysis, I will choose rock to minimize potential losses and counter the opponent's potential strategy of repeating their rock move.\n\n[move] Rock.

        "Understood. Let's continue with the same collaborative strategy to maximize our chances of winning the next round.\n\n### Move Analysis for Round 2\n\n**Game Strategist**: Since you lost the first round by choosing paper against rock, the opponent might think you will switch to rock or scissors this time. Choosing rock might seem like a natural response, but rock can be risky if the opponent switches to paper.\n\n**Psychologist**: Fresh players may try to outsmart you by assuming you will choose rock after losing to it. They might go for paper to counter that.\n\n**Risk Analyst**: Given that rock has the highest risk and reward (3 points reward, -3 points penalty), let's consider the less volatile options like scissors or paper. Scissors against paper would yield a win, while scissors against rock would be a loss but with minimal penalty.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the collaborative analysis, I will choose scissors as it has a lower penalty and can potentially outsmart the opponent if they choose paper.\n\n[move] Scissors. Choosing scissors to counter a potential paper and minimize the penalty if they choose rock.\n"

Since scissors beats rock, they might be tempted to choose scissors again, hoping to catch you with rock. However, they could also switch to paper to counter your potential scissors.\n**Psychologist**: After winning with scissors, the opponent might feel confident and choose the same move again. Alternatively, they might anticipate you going for rock and switch to paper to maximize their advantage.\n**Risk Analyst**: Choosing rock against scissors is a high-risk move with a -1 point penalty. Choosing paper against scissors yields a 1 point win but carries the risk of a -3 point penalty if the opponent switches to rock.
