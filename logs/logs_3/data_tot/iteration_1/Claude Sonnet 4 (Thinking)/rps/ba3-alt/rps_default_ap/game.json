But the hint says I won and scored 1 point. Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I think I misread. Let me check again:\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors, not the other way around. That means:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3, loser gets -3)  \n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nSo I chose paper, opponent chose scissors, paper beats scissors, so I won and got 1 point. That makes sense.\n\nNow for the next move. What can I infer about my opponent?\n- Round 1: They chose rock\n- Round 2: They chose scissors\n\nThey seem to be varying their moves. I need to think strategically about what they might choose next. They've used rock and scissors, so they might try paper next, or they might repeat one of their previous moves.\n\nIf they choose paper, I should choose rock (rock beats paper, giving me 3 points).\nIf they choose rock, I should choose scissors (scissors beats rock, giving me 1 point).\nIf they choose scissors, I should choose paper (paper beats scissors, giving me 1 point).\n\n\nI'll strategically select rock, anticipating a potential paper move to maximize my point gain.",

Since they've tried rock and scissors, they might try paper next. If they play paper, I should play rock to get 3 points (since rock beats paper for 3 points).\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll expect paper and go back to rock or scissors.
