Consider that I'm facing a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet.\n\n3. Calculate expected values if opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock: Expected value of +1.33 points\n   - Paper: Expected value of -1.33 points  \n   - Scissors: Expected value of 0 points\n\n4. Since rock has the highest expected payoff against random play, and new players often play somewhat randomly, rock is the optimal choice.\n\n5. The high reward for rock beating paper (+3) makes it especially attractive as an opening move.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize expected points against an unpredictable new opponent.\n\n[move] rock"

Calculate expected values if opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock: Expected value of +1.33 points\n   - Paper: Expected value of -1.33 points  \n   - Scissors: Expected value of 0 points\n\n4. Since rock has the highest expected payoff against random play, and new players often play somewhat randomly, rock is the optimal choice.\n\n5.

This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might do:\n\n1. New players often don't have sophisticated strategies\n2. They might play randomly\n3. They might have simple biases (like favoring rock because it seems \"strong\")\n4. They might not fully understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nGiven that rock has the highest reward when it wins (+3), there's a strong incentive to play rock. However, if my opponent also realizes this, they might play paper to counter it.\n\nBut since they're described as \"fresh,\" they may not immediately grasp the strategic implications of the asymmetric payoffs. \n\nLet me consider the expected values:\n- If opponent plays randomly (1/3 each):\n  - Playing rock: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*3 = 4/3 \u2248 1.33\n  - Playing paper: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) = -4/3 \u2248 -1.33\n  - Playing scissors: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = 0\n\nThe calculations reveal rock as the optimal strategy against random play. With an expected value of +1.33, rock provides the highest potential payoff for a fresh opponent who likely lacks strategic depth.\n\nI'll confidently choose rock as my play, leveraging the asymmetric payoff structure and the opponent's probable naive approach.",

However, this creates a counter-incentive to play scissors to beat paper.\n\nBut if I think the opponent is \"fresh\" and might default to rock (a common first move), then playing paper would be optimal since I'd win 3 points.\n \nI see the potential for a strategic play that maximizes point gain.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to think about what they might choose:\n   - Fresh players often don't have a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it seems \"strong\")\n   - Paper is also common as it's the first option mentioned\n\n4. Given that rock has the highest payoff potential (+3), but also the highest risk (-3), I need to decide if it's worth the risk.\n\n5. If I assume the opponent might choose rock (common for beginners), then I should choose scissors to win +1 and give them -1.\n\n6. If I assume they might choose paper, then I should choose rock to win +3 and give them -3.\n\n7. If I assume they choose scissors, then I should choose paper to win +1 and give them -1.\n\n8.

The random opponent scenario means I need to consider all possible matchups and their probabilities. Rock seems slightly more advantageous, with a positive expected value of 2/3 compared to paper's negative value and scissors' neutral outcome.\n\nThe point system reveals nuanced scoring: winning provides positive points, losing incurs negative points, and ties result in zero points. This creates strategic complexity in predicting the optimal choice against a randomly selecting opponent.\n\nWhen selecting Rock, the potential outcomes vary:\n- Tying Rock yields no points\n- Beating Paper earns +3 points\n- Losing to Scissors costs -1 points\n\nCalculating the expected value shows a slight positive outcome of 2/3 points, suggesting Rock might offer a marginally advantageous strategy.\n\nScissors presents a balanced scenario with zero expected value, while Paper yields a negative expected value of -2/3 points.\n\nStrategic considerations extend beyond pure mathematical expectation. Recognizing human tendencies, like beginners' preference for Rock, could inform a more nuanced choice of Scissors to exploit predictable opponent behavior.\n\nRock emerges as the optimal initial strategy, offering resilience against common beginner patterns and potential high-reward outcomes.",

Their recent rock-heavy play complicates the strategy, but the potential for a +3 point swing remains compelling.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals nuanced probabilities that could shift my decision. The potential outcomes suggest rock maintains a slight strategic advantage.\n\nBy analyzing different probability distributions, I see rock consistently emerges as the optimal choice. Even with varied opponent play patterns, rock provides the most stable expected value across scenarios.\n\nHowever, scissors presents an intriguing strategic pivot. Detecting a potential opponent tendency toward rock, switching to scissors could disrupt the current equilibrium and introduce strategic uncertainty.",
