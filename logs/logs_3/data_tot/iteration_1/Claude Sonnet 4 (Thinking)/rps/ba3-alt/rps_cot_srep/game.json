Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while other matchups give +1/-1 points.\n\n2. Consider that this is against a fresh player with no known patterns or tendencies.\n\n3. Note that many players tend to open with rock in rock-paper-scissors games, as it feels like an aggressive, strong opening move.\n\n4. If the opponent plays rock, paper would give me the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Paper also only risks -1 point if the opponent plays scissors, making it a reasonable risk/reward choice for an opening move.\n\n6.

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while other matchups give +1/-1 points.\n\n2. Consider that this is against a fresh player with no known patterns or tendencies.\n\n3. Note that many players tend to open with rock in rock-paper-scissors games, as it feels like an aggressive, strong opening move.\n\n4. If the opponent plays rock, paper would give me the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Paper also only risks -1 point if the opponent plays scissors, making it a reasonable risk/reward choice for an opening move.\n\n6. This gives me the best chance to capitalize on a common opening tendency while limiting my downside risk.\n\n[move] paper",

Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 when beating paper) but also the highest potential loss (-3 when losing to paper)\n2. Paper can win big against rock (+3) but loses normally to scissors (-1)\n3. Scissors wins normally against paper (+1) but loses normally to rock (-1)\n\nSince this is against a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns. In classical rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each) to be unpredictable.\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs in this version, I need to think more carefully:\n\n- Playing rock: Expected value depends on opponent's strategy\n\n\n- Playing paper: Potential for a big win against rock, but risky against scissors\n- Playing scissors: Balanced risk and reward\n\nConsidering psychological tendencies, many players instinctively choose rock as their first move. This insight suggests playing paper could be strategically advantageous, potentially securing a +3 point bonus. I'll opt for paper to capitalize on this common opening strategy.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If they choose rock (likely for a new player), paper would give me +3 points\n   \n5. Even against random play, paper has the best expected value due to the asymmetric payoffs\n\n6. Paper seems like the optimal choice to maximize points while managing risk\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper - I'm betting the fresh player will go with rock as their first instinct, and paper beats rock for the maximum 3 points.",

Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n2. Rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper\n3. Paper and scissors have symmetric payoffs (+1/-1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I need to think about what they might choose. Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy, so they might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Choose rock because it's often the first thing people think of\n- Choose something they think is \"strong\" \n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff potential (+3), but also the highest risk (-3), I need to be strategic.\n\nIf I assume the opponent might choose rock (common first choice), then I should choose paper to get +3 points.\n\nIf I assume random play, then:\n- Playing rock: Expected value = (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 3/3 + 0 - 1/3 = 2/3\n- Playing paper: Expected value = (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = -3/3 + 0 + 1/3 = -2/3\n\n\n- Playing scissors: Expected value = (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nI'll carefully recalculate the expected values for each move. Rock's expected value is actually -2/3, which confirms my initial calculation. This suggests rock might not be the optimal choice.\n\nThe nuanced probabilities reveal that scissors provides a neutral expected value, while rock carries more risk. This means I might want to lean towards scissors or paper depending on my read of the opponent's likely strategy.\n\nPaper emerges as the strongest option with a +2/3 expected value against a random player. This suggests paper could be the most strategic choice when facing an unpredictable opponent.\n\nThe subtle differences in expected values highlight the complexity of rock-paper-scissors strategy, where small probability shifts can significantly impact optimal play.\n\nGiven the opponent's potential rock bias as a fresh player, paper becomes an even more compelling selection, offering a clear advantage by scoring +3 points against rock.",

I had this backwards in my head. Let me correct my understanding:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3) \n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo I won correctly with paper beating scissors.\n\nNow for the next round:\n1. The opponent played scissors in round 1\n2. They might:\n   - Stick with scissors \n   - Switch to rock (thinking I might play paper again)\n   - Switch to paper (random change)\n\n3. If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (rock doesn't beat scissors though... wait let me check again)\n\nActually let me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo the correct relationships are:\n- Paper beats scissors \n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is the opposite of traditional rock-paper-scissors!\n\nSo if opponent might play scissors again, I should play paper again (paper beats scissors).\nIf they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper), they'd beat me with rock beating paper for -3 points to me.\nIf they switch to paper, we'd tie.\n\nGiven that they played scissors first (which could be a common opening), they might either:\n1. Stick with it\n2. Try to counter my paper with rock\n\nThe high penalty for rock beating paper (-3) makes me want to avoid that. \n\nI'll strategically choose scissors to minimize potential point loss. If they repeat scissors, we'll tie. Switching to rock gives me a small point gain, while paper risks a point loss. This balanced approach seems prudent given the limited information.",
