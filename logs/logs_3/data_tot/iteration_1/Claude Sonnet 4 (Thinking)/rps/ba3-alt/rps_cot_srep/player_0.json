    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while other matchups give +1/-1 points.\n\n2. Consider that this is against a fresh player with no known patterns or tendencies.\n\n3. Note that many players tend to open with rock in rock-paper-scissors games, as it feels like an aggressive, strong opening move.\n\n4. If the opponent plays rock, paper would give me the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Paper also only risks -1 point if the opponent plays scissors, making it a reasonable risk/reward choice for an opening move.\n\n6.

They completely avoided it for 14 rounds.\n\n2. Updated pattern: scissors (10/15 = 67%), paper (4/15 = 27%), rock (1/15 = 7%).\n\n3. My current total score: +1 + 0 + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + (-3) = -1 points.\n\n4. That rock play was devastating, costing me 3 points and dropping my total into negative territory.\n\n5. The opponent may have finally discovered rock as an effective counter to my frequent paper plays.\n\n6. If opponent continues with their new rock discovery (likely after such success), scissors beats rock for +1 point.\n\n7. Given the opponent's breakthrough moment with rock and its effectiveness against my strategy, scissors offers the best chance to counter their potential continued use of this newly discovered move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Critical observation: The opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 15-16) after completely avoiding it for 14 rounds.\n\n3. My current total score: +1 + 0 + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 + 0 + 0 + (-3) + 1 = 0 points (back to even).\n\n4. The opponent's rock discovery was highly successful (+3 points against my paper), which likely reinforced this new strategy.\n\n5. Playing rock consecutively suggests the opponent may have found a new preferred strategy after seeing its effectiveness.\n\n6. If opponent continues with rock (likely given recent success), scissors beats rock for +1 point.\n\n7. Given the opponent's recent rock pattern and the positive reinforcement they received, scissors offers the best chance to counter their continued rock usage.\n\n[move] scissors"
