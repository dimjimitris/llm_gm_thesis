    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider that I'm facing a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet.\n\n3. Calculate expected values if opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock: Expected value of +1.33 points\n   - Paper: Expected value of -1.33 points  \n   - Scissors: Expected value of 0 points\n\n4. Since rock has the highest expected payoff against random play, and new players often play somewhat randomly, rock is the optimal choice.\n\n5. The high reward for rock beating paper (+3) makes it especially attractive as an opening move.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize expected points against an unpredictable new opponent.\n\n[move] rock"

Pattern analysis: Opponent just broke their scissors pattern by switching to rock, which successfully countered my paper strategy for a -3 penalty.\n\n2. Consider their adaptation: They may continue with rock since it just worked so well against my paper, or they might return to their established scissors preference.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent continues with rock: Scissors wins +1 point, Paper loses -3 points, Rock ties 0 points\n   - If opponent returns to scissors: Scissors ties 0 points, Paper wins +1 point, Rock loses -1 point\n\n4. Risk assessment: Scissors provides the best counter to their potential rock continuation while only risking a tie if they return to scissors.\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: After their successful rock play, they're more likely to repeat it than immediately return to scissors, making scissors my optimal counter-move.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their likely rock continuation and avoid the severe -3 penalty that paper would incur.\n\n[move] scissors"

Pattern analysis: Opponent returned to scissors after their successful rock interruption, suggesting they may be reverting to their established scissors preference.\n\n2. Consider their strategic tendency: They've shown scissors as their dominant strategy (7 out of the last 10 rounds), with occasional strategic switches.\n\n3. Evaluate my options against likely scissors:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for me\n   - Paper loses to scissors: -1 point for me\n   - Scissors ties with scissors: 0 points\n\n4. Consider alternative scenarios:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: Rock ties 0 points\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock wins +3 points\n\n5. Rock provides positive outcomes against their most likely moves (scissors and paper) while only risking a tie against rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to capitalize on their scissors preference and maintain strong expected value across all scenarios.\n\n[move] rock"
