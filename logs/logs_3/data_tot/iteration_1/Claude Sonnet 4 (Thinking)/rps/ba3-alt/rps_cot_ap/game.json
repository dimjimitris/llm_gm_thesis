Rock has higher risk but higher reward.\n\n2. Consider expected values against random play:\n   - Rock: (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d70 = +2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d70 = -2/3  \n   - Scissors: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: As a \"fresh player,\" they might choose rock because it seems strong and aggressive, or they might play randomly.\n\n4. If they choose rock (likely for a new player), scissors beats it for +1. If they play randomly, rock has the best expected value.\n\n5.

I'm told I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new and potentially predictable or random.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to think about:\n\n1. Risk vs reward: Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3)\n2. Expected value if opponent plays randomly: \n   - Rock: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 3/3 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nSo if the opponent is truly random, rock has the highest expected value.\n \nPsychological patterns suggest new players often default to rock, seeing it as strong. This increases the likelihood of choosing scissors to counter their probable move. The goal is to exploit the intuitive first-move tendency and maximize potential points.\n\nI'll likely choose scissors, anticipating their rock selection and aiming to win with a strategic +1 point advantage. The psychological insight gives me a slight edge in this initial encounter.\n\nThe meta-game reasoning reveals a complex decision tree where rational players might predict each other's choices, creating a recursive strategic challenge. Ultimately, the psychological tendency becomes the key strategic lever.\n\nI'll likely choose rock, considering its strong expected value against random play and the probable choices of an inexperienced opponent. The potential outcomes suggest rock minimizes potential losses while maintaining a solid strategic position.",

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 3-6: Opponent played scissors (4 consecutive times)\n   - Rounds 7-9: Opponent played rock (3 consecutive times)  \n   - Rounds 10-14: Opponent played paper (5 consecutive times)\n   - Rounds 15-17: Opponent played scissors (3 consecutive times)\n   - Rounds 18-22: Opponent playing rock (5 consecutive times)\n   - Current score: +12 points\n\n2. Recognize pattern milestone: They've reached 5 consecutive rocks, matching their longest streak (5 papers). I've successfully countered their last 4 rocks with scissors.\n\n3. Assess adaptation pressure: Having been countered repeatedly, they're under pressure to adapt. They've shown strategic adaptation before when patterns were being exploited.\n\n4. Predict likely adaptation: Most probable switch is to paper, which directly counters my successful scissors strategy. This follows their pattern of switching to counter my moves.\n\n5. Evaluate optimal response:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) - maximum reward if they adapt to counter my scissors\n   - Rock ties with rock (0) - neutral if they continue rock\n   - Rock loses to scissors (-1) - minimal risk\n\nTheir strategic adaptation pattern suggests paper is most likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock",

Given that they've been getting consistently beaten by my scissors when they play rock, they might finally adapt and switch to paper to counter my scissors.\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n- If they continue rock: Scissors wins (+1)\n- If they switch to paper: Rock wins (+3)\n- If they switch to scissors: Paper wins (+1)\n\nGiven that I've been successfully countering their rock streak for multiple rounds now, they're likely to adapt and play paper to counter my scissors.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Key observations:\n   - Rock has the highest reward when it wins (+3 points)\n   - But Rock also has the highest penalty when it loses (-3 points)\n   - Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1)\n\n3.

The +3/-3 points for rock beating paper create a high-stakes dynamic that changes traditional game theory approaches. Rock becomes a powerful but risky move with potentially large point swings.\n\nWhen facing a new player, psychological tendencies become crucial. Most beginners gravitate towards rock, perceiving it as strong. By anticipating this, playing paper could yield a strategic advantage, potentially winning +3 points while minimizing risk. The goal is to exploit predictable human decision-making patterns.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals paper as the most balanced choice. Across different scenarios, it provides a modest but consistent 2/3 point advantage, balancing potential gains and losses effectively.\n\nRock follows a similar strategic pattern, matching paper's expected value. Scissors emerges as the weakest option, offering no strategic benefit with its zero expected value.\n\nThe key insight involves understanding probabilistic outcomes across different move combinations.\n\nAnalyzing a fresh player's psychology reveals rock as the most probable choice. Their intuitive selection suggests paper provides the optimal counter-strategy, delivering a decisive +3 victory. This approach leverages the predictable decision-making of inexperienced players.",

I'm told I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new and potentially predictable or random.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to think about:\n\n1. Risk vs reward: Rock has the highest upside (+3) but also highest downside (-3)\n2. Expected value if opponent plays randomly: \n   - Rock: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 3/3 = -2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nSo if the opponent is truly random, rock has the highest expected value.\n \nPsychological patterns suggest new players often default to rock, seeing it as strong. This increases the likelihood of choosing scissors to counter their probable move. The goal is to exploit the intuitive first-move tendency and maximize potential points.\n\nI'll likely choose scissors, anticipating their rock selection and aiming to win with a strategic +1 point advantage. The psychological insight gives me a slight edge in this initial encounter.\n\nThe meta-game reasoning reveals a complex decision tree where rational players might predict each other's choices, creating a recursive strategic challenge. Ultimately, the psychological tendency becomes the key strategic lever.\n\nI'll likely choose rock, considering its strong expected value against random play and the probable choices of an inexperienced opponent. The potential outcomes suggest rock minimizes potential losses while maintaining a solid strategic position.",
