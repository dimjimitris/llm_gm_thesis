Rock gives the highest reward when it wins (+3 points)\n2. Rock also gives the highest penalty when it loses (-3 points)\n3. Paper and Scissors have symmetric payoffs (+1/-1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might do:\n- Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy\n- They might choose randomly\n- They might have some bias toward certain moves (rock is often popular as a first choice)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If I assume random play from opponent: Each move has equal expected value of 0\n2. If I assume opponent favors rock: I should play paper to get +3\n3. If I assume opponent favors paper: I should play scissors to get +1\n4. If I assume opponent favors scissors: I should play rock to get +3\n\nGiven that this is the first round and the opponent is \"fresh,\" I think there's a reasonable chance they might go with rock (it's a common first instinct). Playing paper would give me the highest possible reward (+3) if they choose rock.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that rock has the highest variance - if I'm wrong and they play scissors, I lose 1 point instead of 3.\n\n\nI'll strategically choose paper, anticipating a potential rock move from my inexperienced opponent.

Don't include the [move] tag in my reasoning, only in the actual move message\n6. No nested parentheses or markdown formatting\n7. Format: [move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nSo I can have reasoning/explanation outside the move message, and then have the properly formatted move message.\n\nLet me think about my strategy first. This is rock-paper-scissors with modified scoring:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points\n\nSo rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also the highest risk (-3). Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nAgainst a fresh player, I should consider what they might play. Many beginners do tend to choose rock first. If they choose rock and I choose rock, it's a tie (0 points). If they choose rock and I choose scissors, I lose 1 point. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I lose 3 points.\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins +3, paper loses -3)  \n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n\nSo if opponent plays rock:\n- If I play rock: tie (0 points each)\n- If I play paper: I lose 3 points (rock beats paper)\n- If I play scissors: I win 1 point (scissors beats rock)\n \nAnalyzing opponent scenarios reveals nuanced scoring implications. Against paper, rock provides the highest potential gain of 3 points. Scissors offers a modest 1-point win against paper. Choosing paper results in a neutral tie. The strategic complexity increases with each potential move, balancing risk and reward carefully.\n\nUltimately, rock emerges as the most promising initial approach, maximizing potential point accumulation through its high-value outcome against specific opponent choices.",

Paper and scissors have more balanced +1/-1 outcomes. \n\nPlayers might choose randomly or have subtle biases. Many tend to start with rock, so I'll consider that possibility carefully. The game's uneven stakes make rock a high-risk, high-reward choice.\n\nCalculating expected values reveals rock has a slight advantage when assuming random selection, with an expected value of 2/3 compared to paper's -2/3. This suggests rock might be the most strategic initial move.\n\nWhile mathematical analysis points to rock, psychological patterns could shift the optimal strategy.

Rock (opponent won vs my paper, -3 for me)\n17. Paper (opponent won vs my scissors, -1 for me)\n\nSo my opponent's sequence has been:\nRock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n\nLet me look at the recent pattern more carefully:\n- Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n\nIt's quite unpredictable. I've been losing a lot of points trying to predict their moves. Let me think about this differently.\n\nI keep trying to outsmart them and predict their moves, but I'm losing points consistently. Maybe I should focus on a more defensive strategy.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats Paper (+3 vs -3)\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1 vs -1)  \n\n\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1 vs -1)\n\nI'm noticing the high-risk nature of rock plays. The strategy needs to balance potential gains with potential losses. Paper and scissors seem more consistent, offering moderate rewards while minimizing catastrophic defeats.\n\nMy opponent's pattern suggests randomness, making prediction futile. A balanced approach that limits maximum loss while maintaining scoring opportunities might be more effective.\n\nRock appears frequently, but playing paper hasn't worked consistently. I need a nuanced strategy that considers all possible outcomes and their corresponding point values.\n\nThe scoring dynamics reveal complex interactions: some moves carry massive point swings while others remain more conservative. Understanding these subtle rule variations could provide a strategic edge.\n\nMy current analysis suggests carefully mapping each potential matchup, tracking potential point gains and losses across different scenarios. The goal is identifying optimal play patterns that minimize risk while maximizing potential scoring opportunities.\n\nWhen playing Scissors, I observe:\n- Against Rock: I lose -1 point\n- Against Paper: I gain +1 point\n- Against Scissors: Result is a neutral 0 points\n\nThe scoring dynamics reveal nuanced strategic implications for each potential move, with point values varying significantly based on opponent's choice.\n\nI see the payoff dynamics more clearly now. Each move has strategic nuances with different win, loss, and tie scenarios. Scissors emerges as an intriguing option with moderate risk and potential upside. It prevents catastrophic -3 losses while offering occasional +1 gains. Given the opponent's unpredictable pattern and my recent significant losses, Scissors seems like a calculated defensive strategy that maintains some offensive potential. With their last move being Paper, there's a strategic consideration about potential move repetition.\n\nIf they continue Paper, I'll face a -1 outcome. But switching to Rock would let me win +1, and a Scissors choice would result in a tie. This approach balances defensive positioning with opportunistic counterplay.",
