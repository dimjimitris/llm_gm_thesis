    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They might not be following typical \"fresh player\" patterns\n2. They could be thinking one level ahead - expecting us to expect rock\n3. Or they could be playing randomly\n\nSince they just played paper, we need to consider what they might do next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have actual data. The opponent chose paper in round 1. A few strategic considerations:\n1. If they stick with paper: We should play rock for the big +3 reward\n2. If they switch to rock (common after losing): We should avoid paper (which would lose -3)\n3. If they switch to scissors: Paper would win +1\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest reward (+3) if they stick with paper, and many players repeat moves after losing, rock seems attractive.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent played paper and lost, getting +1 while I got -1. Psychologically, do players tend to repeat losing moves or change them?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often switch after losing, but paper players sometimes stick with paper because it's perceived as \"safe\" or \"neutral.\" However, there's also a tendency to escalate to rock after a loss. The key insight is that if they do switch to rock, we definitely don't want to play paper (-3 penalty).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend rock for round 2. Here's the risk-reward:\n- If opponent repeats paper: We win +3 (excellent)\n- If opponent switches to rock: We tie 0 (neutral)\n- If opponent switches to scissors: We lose -1 (acceptable loss)\n\nRock gives us the best upside with manageable downside.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Agreed.

The opponent played:\n- Round 1: Paper (beat my scissors)  \n- Round 2: Scissors (beat my rock)\n\nThey're winning consistently and seem to be anticipating our moves. This suggests either:\n1. They're experienced and reading our strategy\n2. They're following a pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n3.

The opponent has won both rounds, scoring +1 each time while we've lost -1 each time. If they're following the pattern paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, then we should play paper next to beat rock and finally score a point (+1).\n\nBut there's another consideration: if they're adapting to our moves, they might expect us to think they'll play rock next, so they could play scissors again or paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're currently at -2 total points.

But they also know that when they played paper in round 5, our rock destroyed them for -3. \n\nThey're in a tricky spot: paper just worked, but they know we might expect paper and counter with rock for the big +3.\n\nThis creates a mind game: \n- If they think we'll play rock (expecting their paper): They might play scissors\n- If they think we won't risk the rock: They might play paper again\n- If they want to be unpredictable: They might play rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just succeeded with paper and might be tempted to repeat it, should we go for the big +3 with rock?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's definitely a psychological pull for them to repeat the move that just worked. Players often ride winning streaks, even short ones. The question is whether they'll be afraid of our rock counter.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think we should play rock. Here's the reasoning:\n- If they repeat paper (likely after success): We get +3\n- If they play scissors (fearing our rock): We lose -1 (manageable)  \n- If they play rock: We tie 0\n\nThe +3 potential against likely paper repetition outweighs the risks.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Agreed.

If they continue the paper-scissors alternation, they should play paper next (round 9). This alternating strategy is actually quite smart - it avoids rock entirely (which has been inconsistent for them) and focuses on the two moves that give +1/-1 payoffs instead of the risky +3/-3.\n\nIf they play paper next, we should definitely play scissors for the +1 win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The alternating pattern is very clear now. Should we capitalize on this predictable pattern with scissors?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes! They've locked into a rhythm that's working moderately well for them (avoiding the big -3 losses).

Stick with the \"pattern-breaker\" move for a few rounds (momentum)\n2. Return to what worked before after testing the waters\n\nSince scissors just tied (not a loss), they might be more likely to play it again than if it had lost.

They can't seem to stick with either strategy consistently.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent displays the strangest decision-making pattern I've ever analyzed. They have a move (scissors) that works reasonably well, and a move (paper) that has failed them 6 times for -3 each time. Yet they keep cycling between them.\n\nFor round 20, if they follow this unstable pattern:\n- They might return to paper (testing it again after scissors success)\n- They might stick with scissors (since it just worked)\n- They might try rock (completing the cycle)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their inability to learn from paper failures but occasional use of working scissors, what's our best move?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their pattern suggests they might test paper again soon (they seem addicted to it despite the losses), but they also might ride the scissors momentum briefly.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend scissors for round 20:\n- If they play paper (testing again): We win +1\n- If they play scissors (sticking with success): We tie 0  \n- If they play rock (new experiment): We win +1\n\nScissors gives us positive outcomes in 2/3 scenarios and avoids the risk of their scissors beating our rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors seems like the safest choice that still gives us winning opportunities.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to beat likely paper test or potential rock while tying against scissors continuation) scissors"

The opponent just played scissors for the second consecutive time (rounds 19-20), both resulting in ties when we also played scissors.\n\nTheir recent behavior shows they're settling into scissors after it provided some relief from their paper disasters. Two ties in a row with scissors might reinforce that it's a \"safe\" move that doesn't lose them points.\n\nHowever, they've shown a disturbing tendency to periodically return to paper despite its repeated failures.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their pattern:\n- Multiple scissors in a row (recent success/neutral)\n- Periodic returns to paper (always disastrous -3 losses)\n- Very little rock experimentation\n\nFor round 21, they'll likely either:\n1. Continue with scissors (since it's been working safely)  \n2. Test paper again (their inexplicable addiction)\n3. Try something completely different like rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They seem more comfortable with scissors now after those ties. Should we counter with rock?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, they appear to be finding confidence in scissors as their \"stable\" move. After two ties, they might view it as reliable and continue with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend rock for round 21:\n- If they play scissors (likely): We win +1\n- If they play paper (periodic testing): We win +3  \n- If they play rock (unlikely): We tie 0\n\nRock gives us positive outcomes in the two most likely scenarios, with huge upside if they return to their paper obsession.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock covers both their likely scissors continuation and their possible paper relapse.

The opponent just broke their 5-game scissors winning streak by playing rock for the first time in many rounds. This is a significant strategic pivot.\n\nAfter finding tremendous success with scissors (3 wins, 2 ties over 5 rounds), they abandoned it to try rock. This could indicate:\n1. They're evolving their strategy and trying to stay unpredictable\n2. They realized we might be preparing to counter their scissors streak\n3. They're testing rock as a new \"safe\" move\n4. This could be another impulsive decision like their paper relapses\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This strategic shift is fascinating. They went from:\n- 5 consecutive scissors (highly successful)\n- 1 rock (tied with our rock)\n\nThe question for round 25 is: will they stick with rock (testing it further) or return to their successful scissors strategy?\n\nFor round 25:\n- If they continue with rock: We should play scissors (+1)\n- If they return to scissors: We should play rock (+1)  \n- If they test paper: We should play scissors (+1)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** After breaking such a successful scissors streak, what's the psychological tendency?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who break winning streaks often do one of two things:\n1.
