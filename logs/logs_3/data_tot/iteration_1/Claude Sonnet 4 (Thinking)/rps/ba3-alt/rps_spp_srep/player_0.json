    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to identify the right personas to help me win this rock-paper-scissors variant game.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that rock provides the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This creates interesting strategic implications. If players realize rock's high value, they might be more likely to play paper to counter it, which makes scissors more attractive.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** For a \"fresh player\" (assuming this means inexperienced), there are common behavioral patterns:\n1. Many beginners default to rock as their first move - it feels more aggressive/strong\n2. Some go with scissors because it's the last option mentioned\n3. Paper is often seen as the \"weakest\" conceptually\n4. Fresh players rarely think about the asymmetric payoffs immediately\n\nGiven the high reward for beating paper with rock, but also considering that fresh players might choose rock frequently, this creates a complex decision.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, it seems like there are two main considerations:\n1. If the opponent chooses rock (common for beginners), I should choose paper for the +3 points\n2. But if many players figure out rock's value and choose paper to counter expected rocks, then scissors becomes valuable\n\nFor the first move against a fresh player, what's your recommendation?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Against a truly fresh player who doesn't understand the payoff asymmetry, I'd recommend paper. Here's why:\n- Fresh players often default to rock (psychological tendency)\n- Paper vs rock gives us +3 points (the maximum possible)\n- Even if they choose scissors, we only lose -1 (manageable risk)\n- The risk/reward ratio favors paper against naive players\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with paper for the first move. Fresh players have a slight bias toward rock, and the +3 payoff for paper beating rock is too valuable to ignore. It's a calculated risk with high upside.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - reasoning that a fresh player is likely to choose rock due to psychological tendencies, and paper beating rock gives the maximum possible points (+3).\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Let me collaborate with my personas again for round 2.\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting result! The opponent chose scissors instead of the expected rock. This gives us information:\n1. They might not be as \"fresh\" as we thought, or\n2. They're thinking about the payoff matrix and chose scissors to counter an expected rock choice from us\n3. Or it could just be random\n\nNow they know we played paper in round 1. What might they be thinking for round 2?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** A few possibilities for their next move:\n1. If they're learning, they might switch to rock to beat our paper (since we just played paper)\n2. They might stick with scissors if they think we'll play paper again\n3. They could try paper themselves, thinking we might switch to rock\n4. There's also the possibility they're just playing randomly\n\nThe key question is: are they adapting to our previous move or playing their own strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they chose scissors (which beats rock for +1), they might be thinking about the value of beating rock. If they expect us to play rock this round (maybe thinking we'll switch from paper), they might stick with scissors. \n\nBut if they're counter-adapting to our paper, they'd choose rock. The high payoff of rock beating paper (+3) makes it very tempting for someone who just lost to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the main scenarios are:\n1. They play rock (adapting to beat our paper) - we should play paper again for +3\n2. They play scissors again (expecting us to switch to rock) - we should play rock for +3\n3. They play paper (trying to counter expected rock from us) - we should play scissors for +1\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward them choosing rock. Players who just lost often try to directly counter their opponent's last move. Since we played paper, rock directly beats paper and gives them the maximum points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. The psychological tendency to counter-adapt, combined with rock's high payoff against paper, makes rock their most likely choice. I recommend paper again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - expecting the opponent to choose rock as a direct counter to our previous paper move, seeking the high +3 payoff.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Very revealing! The opponent played scissors twice in a row. This suggests several possibilities:\n1. They're committed to a pure scissors strategy\n2. They're expecting us to eventually switch to rock (since scissors beats rock)\n3. They're not adapting to our moves at all\n4. They might be stuck in a psychological pattern\n\nThe fact that they didn't adapt after losing twice is significant data.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This behavior suggests either:\n1. A very inexperienced player who doesn't understand adaptation\n2. Someone testing if we'll stick to paper or eventually switch\n3. A player who's fixated on the idea that we'll play rock eventually\n\nThe lack of adaptation after two losses is quite telling. Most players would try something different by now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they've played scissors twice and we've won both times with paper, what should we expect for round 3?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue with scissors, paper wins again (+1). But there's also the possibility they finally adapt. However, their pattern suggests they might stick with scissors for a third time. The question is: do we exploit this pattern or do we anticipate they'll finally change?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think there's a high probability they stick with scissors again. Some players get locked into patterns, especially if they believe their opponent will \"eventually\" switch. They might think \"surely they won't play paper three times in a row.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The risk-reward analysis supports playing paper again:\n- If they play scissors again: we win +1 (continuing our winning streak)\n- If they switch to rock: we win +3 (even better!)\n- If they switch to paper: we tie (0 points, but no loss)\n\nPaper dominates against their likely moves.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - the opponent has shown a clear pattern of playing scissors, and paper beats scissors. Even if they adapt and play rock, we get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

They are learning and capable of adaptation\n2. They might have figured out our paper strategy\n3. The tie suggests they're trying to neutralize our advantage\n\nNow the question is: what's their next move? Do they think we'll stick with paper, or do they expect us to adapt too?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This adaptation shows they're not completely naive. After losing twice with scissors, they switched to paper - possibly thinking:\n1. \"If they keep playing paper, I'll tie instead of losing\"\n2. \"Maybe they'll switch to rock now, so paper beats rock for +3\"\n3. They might be testing to see if we're locked into paper or if we adapt too\n\nThe fact that they adapted suggests they'll continue to think strategically.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have an adapting opponent now. What are the likely scenarios for round 4?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key scenarios:\n1. They stick with paper (thinking we'll continue with paper) - we should play scissors for +1\n2. They switch to rock (expecting us to switch to rock, or trying to beat expected paper) - we should play paper for +3\n3. They switch to scissors (going back to original strategy or expecting us to play rock) - we should play rock for +3\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they just successfully countered our pattern, they might:\n1. Stick with paper if they think we're predictable\n2. Switch to rock if they expect us to finally change our strategy\nI lean toward them playing rock - they've seen that adapting worked (got a tie instead of a loss), so they might push further and go for the high-value rock play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I also lean toward rock. They've shown they can adapt, and rock gives them the best chance at the maximum +3 points if we stick with paper. They might think \"surely they won't play paper a fourth time.\"\n\nIf they play rock, we should play paper for +3. If they stick with paper, we should play scissors for +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The decision seems to be between paper (betting they'll play rock) and scissors (betting they'll stick with paper).

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Very interesting pattern emerging! Their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper. They seem to be playing in pairs - two scissors, now two papers. This could indicate:\n1. They're trying to establish paper as their new strategy\n2. They're testing our commitment to paper\n3. They might be planning their next adaptation\n4. Or they could be stuck in a new pattern\n\nThe double-tie suggests they're either very committed to paper or they're setting up for their next move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern of playing moves in pairs is actually quite common in psychological game theory. After switching from scissors to paper successfully (getting a tie instead of a loss), they might:\n1. Feel confident that paper is working\n2. Be planning to switch again after establishing the pattern\n3. Expect us to finally break from paper after two ties\n\nMany players think in sequences and might be planning: \"I'll play paper twice to establish it, then switch to something else.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have scissors-scissors-paper-paper. If they're thinking in pairs, what might come next?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue the pair pattern, they might switch to rock for the next two moves. Rock would make sense because:\n1. It's the third move type (completing the cycle)\n2. Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 points\n3. They might expect us to finally abandon paper after two ties\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with the rock prediction. Players often cycle through strategies, and after \"testing\" paper twice, rock is a logical next step. Plus, the high payoff of rock beating paper (+3) is very appealing after two neutral ties.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock, we should definitely play paper for +3. If they stick with paper for a third time, we should play scissors for +1. But based on the pattern, rock seems most likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The risk-reward strongly favors paper:\n- If they play rock (most likely): +3 points\n- If they play paper again: 0 points (tie)\n- If they switch to scissors: -1 points\n\nThe potential for +3 points outweighs the small risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - expecting the opponent to switch to rock as part of their apparent pattern of playing moves in pairs (scissors-scissors, paper-paper, likely rock next).\n\n[move] Paper"

Stick with rock (completing the pair and expecting us to stick with paper)\n2. Switch because they think we'll finally adapt away from paper\n3.

So it wasn't consistent pairs after all. Let me analyze:\n\nThey went from winning with rock (+3) to playing scissors, which suggests:\n1. They expected us to switch to scissors (to counter rock)\n2. They were trying to counter our expected adaptation\n3. They might be cycling through moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors (restart)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating behavior!

Instead they switched to scissors, possibly thinking:\n1. \"They'll definitely play scissors now to beat my rock\"\n2. \"I'll counter their scissors with rock\" - but they played scissors, not rock\n3. Or they're just cycling through the moves\n\nThe fact that they didn't stick with the winning rock shows more sophisticated thinking than just \"repeat what worked.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So their sequence suggests they might be cycling or trying to counter-adapt. What should we expect for round 7?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** A few possibilities:\n1. If they're cycling: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ? (maybe paper next?)\n2. If they're adapting: they just lost with scissors, so maybe they'll try rock or paper\n3. If they think we'll stick with paper (since it's been working): they might play rock again for +3\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that they just lost again after their big win, they might be frustrated and want to get back to rock (which gave them success). The psychology of recent loss often drives players back to their last winning strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I lean toward rock. Here's why:\n1. Rock was their recent big success (+3)\n2. They've now tried scissors twice after the rock win and lost both times\n3. They might think we're back to predictable paper\n4. The high payoff of rock vs paper (+3) is very tempting\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play rock again, paper gives us +3.

Look at their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock. They're now alternating between moves that beat paper (rock for +3) and other moves.\n\nThey just got another +3 win with rock. We're down to -3 total points and they're probably +3 or more. They know we love paper, and rock beats paper with maximum points. We MUST adapt now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They've caught on to our predictability! Playing paper for 7 straight rounds has made us completely readable. They're now likely thinking:\n1. \"This player always plays paper\"\n2. \"I can get +3 points anytime I play rock\"\n3. They might even be setting up patterns to maximize their rock plays\n\nWe've become too predictable and they're exploiting it. The psychological dynamic has shifted - they have the upper hand.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right. We need to break the pattern. If we play paper again, they'll likely play rock again for another +3. What should we switch to?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key analysis for round 8:\n- If they expect paper again (very likely), they'll play rock for +3\n- If we play scissors, we beat their expected rock for +1\n- If we play rock ourselves, we tie their expected rock for 0\n- We need to punish their rock expectation\n\nI strongly recommend scissors. It's the counter to rock, and they're probably planning rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Scissors makes perfect sense psychologically too. After being exploited repeatedly, we need to show we can adapt. Scissors sends the message that we're no longer predictable, and if they're planning another rock play (which seems very likely), we'll finally win against them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, scissors is the strategic move. It directly counters their most profitable play against us (rock), and even if they play paper, we only lose -1 (much better than the -3 we'd lose with paper vs rock).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - breaking our predictable paper pattern to counter their likely rock play, which they've been using to exploit us for +3 points.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper.\n\nThis suggests they're not just following patterns - they're actively counter-adapting to our adaptations! They may have realized we'd eventually switch away from paper and chose paper to beat our likely scissors choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is high-level psychological gameplay! They've shown they can:\n1. Exploit our predictability (rock when we played paper)\n2. Anticipate our adaptation (paper when we switched to scissors)\n3. They're thinking one level deeper than us\n\nWe're dealing with a sophisticated opponent who's reading our thought process, not just our moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they're counter-adapting. For round 9, what might they be thinking?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They might think:\n1. \"I just beat their scissors with paper, so they might go back to paper\"\n2. \"Or they might try rock next to beat paper\"\n3. \"Or they might stick with scissors thinking I'll play rock\"\n\nWe need to think about what they think we'll think they'll do!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After being outmaneuvered twice (rock beating our paper, then paper beating our scissors), we might look desperate or confused to them. They might expect us to:\n1. Go back to our \"comfort zone\" of paper\n2. Try rock to beat their recent paper\n3. Or double-down on scissors\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their sophistication, I think they might expect us to play rock (to beat their paper). If they expect rock from us, they should play paper again. But if they think we think they'll play rock (because it worked before), they might play paper to beat our expected scissors.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe we should simplify and play rock - it beats their recent paper and gives us +3 if they repeat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with rock. Sometimes when games get too complex psychologically, the direct counter works. They just played paper, rock beats paper for +3, and it shows we can adapt in multiple directions.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - directly countering their recent paper play for the high +3 payoff, and showing we can adapt beyond just paper/scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Let's look at their complete sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.\n\nThey've beaten us 4 out of the last 5 rounds by consistently staying one step ahead of our thinking. They're not following simple patterns - they're actively counter-adapting to our psychological state and likely moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We're being completely outplayed psychologically. They've demonstrated they can:\n1. Exploit our predictability (multiple rock plays when we used paper)\n2. Anticipate our first adaptation (paper when we switched to scissors)  \n3. Counter our second adaptation (scissors when we tried rock)\n\nWe're in a psychological spiral where they're reading us like a book. We need to break this pattern of being reactive.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So for round 10, they're probably expecting us to either go back to paper (our \"comfort zone\") or try another adaptation. What's our best move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is incredibly difficult because they've shown they can predict our logical moves. Let me think:\n- If they expect paper (likely), they'll play rock for +3\n- If they expect scissors (counter to expected rock), they'll play rock \n- If they expect rock (repeat our last move), they'll play paper\n\nThey seem to excel at predicting our most \"logical\" choice and countering it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given how well they read us, maybe we should go with the move that seems least logical from their perspective. They've seen us cling to paper, then try scissors, then try rock. \n\nWhat if we go back to scissors? It might seem illogical since scissors just worked FOR them against our rock, but that's exactly why they might not expect it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's interesting reverse psychology. If they think we'll avoid scissors (since it just beat us), scissors might actually be unexpected. Plus, if they're expecting paper from us and plan to play rock, scissors beats rock for +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors does have merit - it's the counter to rock, and if they're expecting us to retreat to paper, they'll likely play rock again for the easy +3.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - using reverse psychology against a sophisticated opponent who may expect us to avoid the move that just beat us, while positioning to counter their likely rock play if they expect our return to paper.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's analyze their full sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nNotice they started with scissors-scissors, and now they're ending with scissors-scissors. This could be:\n1. Bookending strategy (returning to their opening)\n2. Testing if we'll expect a third scissors\n3. Setting up for a major switch\n\nThe fact that we tied means they didn't gain advantage this round - they might be ready to switch strategies.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This tie might be significant psychologically. After dominating us for several rounds, they just got a neutral result. They might be thinking:\n1. \"Time to switch since scissors isn't working now\"\n2. \"They'll expect me to continue with scissors, so I'll counter that\"\n3. \"Let me go back to rock since that's been most profitable against them (+3 twice)\"\n\nTheir recent success with rock might pull them back to it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're right about rock being their most successful move. They got +3 twice with rock against our paper. For round 11, what are the scenarios?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key scenarios:\n1. They play scissors again (third in a row) - we should play rock for +3\n2. They switch to rock (expecting us to play rock to counter expected scissors) - we should play paper for +3  \n3. They switch to paper (expecting us to play scissors to counter expected rock) - we should play scissors for +1\n\nGiven their pattern-breaking ability and the success they've had with rock, I lean toward them playing rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with rock. After the neutral tie, they might want to get back to their most profitable move. Rock has given them two +3 victories against us. They might think we'll play scissors (to counter their recent scissors plays) and rock beats scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock, paper gives us +3 and helps us recover from our -5 point deficit. The risk-reward favors paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - expecting the opponent to return to rock (their most profitable move against us) after the neutral tie, seeking to capitalize on their psychological tendency to return to successful strategies.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let's analyze their sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors.\n\nThey just played three scissors in a row (rounds 9-11). This is interesting because:\n1. They started with scissors-scissors (rounds 1-2)\n2. Now they're doing scissors-scissors-scissors (rounds 9-11)\n3. They might be cycling back to earlier patterns\n\nThe question is: will they continue with a fourth scissors, or switch after three?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three scissors in a row, they might be thinking:\n1. \"Surely they won't expect a fourth scissors\"\n2. \"Time to switch since I just lost with scissors\"\n3. \"Let me go back to rock since that's been my most successful move\"\n\nPlayers often feel uncomfortable playing the same move too many times in a row, especially after a loss. The psychological pressure to switch increases with each repetition.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they're likely to switch from scissors for round 12. What are the most probable alternatives?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their history:\n1. Rock has been their most profitable move (+3 twice against our paper)\n2. Paper worked well when they were counter-adapting to us\n3. But they might avoid paper since we just played it successfully\n\nI think rock is most likely. They've shown they return to successful strategies, and rock has given them the biggest wins.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I strongly agree with rock. After losing with scissors, they'll want to switch to something more powerful. Rock:\n- Beat us twice for +3 points each\n- Feels psychologically \"stronger\" after losing\n- They might expect us to play scissors (to counter their recent scissors trend)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play rock, we should play paper for +3. This would be a great recovery move for us. Even if they play something else:\n- vs paper: tie (0 points)\n- vs scissors: lose -1 point\n\nThe potential +3 gain outweighs the risks.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - expecting the opponent to switch from their three-scissors streak back to rock (their most successful move), allowing us to capitalize with the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"
