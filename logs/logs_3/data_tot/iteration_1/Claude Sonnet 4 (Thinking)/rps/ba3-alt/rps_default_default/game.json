Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy, so they might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Choose rock because it's often the first thing people think of\n3. Choose paper because it's the \"first\" option mentioned\n4. Choose scissors because it's memorable\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), if I can predict when my opponent will choose paper, playing rock would be very advantageous. However, if they choose scissors, I'd lose 1 point.\n\nFor a first move against a fresh player, I think rock is a reasonable choice because:\n1. Many beginners default to rock\n2. If they choose paper, I lose big (-3), but if they choose scissors, I only lose small (-1)\n3. If they choose rock (tie), no points\n4. If they somehow choose scissors, I win small (+1)\n\nActually, let me reconsider this. If they choose paper and I choose rock, I lose 3 points. That's a big penalty. \n\nLet me think about this differently. What's the safest strategy? \n\nIf I choose paper:\n- vs rock: I win +3\n- vs scissors: I lose -1  \n- vs paper: tie 0\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- vs paper: I lose -3\n- vs scissors: I win +1\n- vs rock: tie 0\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- vs rock: I lose -1\n\n\n- vs paper: I win +1\n- vs scissors: tie 0\n\nI'm leaning towards scissors as a strategic first move. It offers a balanced approach with minimal risk, potentially countering a beginner's likely rock choice while avoiding significant point losses.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I need to think about what they might do:\n1. They might choose randomly\n2. They might have some bias toward certain moves\n3. They might not fully understand the payoff structure\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff when it wins (+3 vs +1 for the others), but I'm playing against someone new who might not realize this asymmetry, I think there are a few reasonable strategies:\n\n1. Play rock to try for the big +3 payoff\n2. Play scissors to counter rock (in case they go for the high-value move)\n3. Play paper to counter scissors\n\nSince this is the first move and I have no information about their tendencies, and rock offers the highest reward, I think I'll go with rock. The risk is higher (-3 if they play scissors) but the reward is also higher (+3 if they play paper).\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. If they're a fresh player, they might:\n- Choose rock because it seems \"strong\"\n- Choose scissors because it's listed last\n- Choose paper because it's listed first\n\n\n- Choose randomly\n\nI'm leaning toward rock, anticipating they might choose rock or paper. The potential +3 payoff for beating paper is tempting, and I'm willing to accept the risk of losing -3 if they choose scissors.",
