    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant game, I need to identify the right personas to help me develop a winning strategy.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theorist; Psychology Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theorist:** Let me analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3/-3 \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest reward potential (+3) but also the highest risk (-3). This creates an interesting strategic dynamic. If opponents expect you to play Rock for the high reward, they might counter with Paper more often.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors typically:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move - about 35-40% of players)\n2. Play somewhat randomly initially\n3. Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\nGiven they don't know the payoff structure, they won't initially bias toward Paper to counter our potential Rock plays.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have two key considerations: Rock offers the highest reward (+3) but creates the highest risk (-3). Against a fresh player who likely defaults to Rock initially, what should our opening move be?\n\n**Game Theorist:** If the opponent plays Rock (which Psychology Expert suggests is likely), then:\n- Our Paper beats their Rock: +3 points for us\n- Our Rock ties with their Rock: 0 points\n- Our Scissors loses to their Rock: -1 points\n\nPaper seems like the optimal choice against a Rock-heavy opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Fresh players tend toward Rock, and even if they don't, Paper is a solid choice because:\n1. It counters the most likely opponent move (Rock)\n2. It gives us the maximum possible points (+3) in that scenario\n3. Even if wrong, our worst case is -1 (if they play Scissors)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Excellent analysis. Paper gives us the best expected value against a fresh player's likely behavior patterns, with maximum upside against their probable Rock choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - to capitalize on the high probability that a fresh player will choose Rock, giving us the maximum +3 point reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Resume collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theorist:** Very interesting! Both players chose Paper. This suggests the opponent isn't as \"fresh\" as we initially thought, or they quickly adapted to the payoff structure. They likely reasoned similarly to us - that Paper counters the expected Rock play and offers high reward potential.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This changes our read on the opponent significantly. They're either:\n1. More sophisticated than a typical \"fresh\" player\n2. Got lucky with the same reasoning we used\n3. Might now be thinking \"since we both played Paper, what will they do next?\"\n\nThe key psychological question: will they stick with Paper (thinking it worked as a tie), switch to counter our expected Paper (Rock), or try something else?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they played Paper strategically, how should this change our approach for round 2?\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they think we'll stick with Paper again, they might play Rock to get the +3 points. But if they think we'll anticipate that and switch to Scissors to counter their Rock, they might play Paper again or switch to Scissors themselves.\n\nHowever, there's a simpler consideration: if they're strategic, they probably realize that Rock offers the highest reward (+3) and might be tempted to use it now that they've shown they can think beyond basic rock-paper-scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward them switching to Rock. Here's why:\n1. The tie shows they can think strategically\n2. Rock's +3 reward is very tempting once you understand the payoffs\n3. They might think we'll repeat Paper or switch unpredictably\n4. Many players escalate to the \"power move\" (Rock) after showing they understand the game\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're likely to play Rock seeking that +3 reward, we should play Paper again to counter it and claim those +3 points ourselves.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Exactly. Paper beats Rock for +3, and even if we're wrong:\n- If they play Scissors, we lose 1 point (manageable)  \n- If they play Paper again, it's another tie (neutral)\n\nThe risk-reward favors Paper again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - the opponent likely learned about Rock's high reward potential and may try to use it, making Paper our best counter-strategy.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me reread the rules:\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3) \n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo the cycle is Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock (standard), but with asymmetric payoffs. Rock is the \"power move\" that beats Paper for maximum points, but loses to Scissors for minimal penalty.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This completely changes our opponent analysis! They played Rock and won +3 points - they either:\n1. Got lucky \n2. Actually understood that Rock beats Paper (unlike us!)\n3. Went for the high-reward move\n\nOur prediction was right (they'd play Rock) but our understanding of what counters Rock was wrong.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So I've been misunderstanding the basic game mechanics! Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors, Scissors beats Rock. Given that the opponent just successfully used Rock for +3 points, what should we expect now?\n\n**Game Theorist:** The opponent is now +3 points ahead and has seen that Rock can be very effective. They might:\n1. Stick with Rock (it just worked perfectly)\n2. Expect us to counter with Scissors, so they switch to Paper\n3. Think we're confused (which we were!) and try Rock again\n\nBut here's the key insight: Scissors beats Rock for only +1/-1, while Rock beats Paper for +3/-3. The asymmetric payoffs make Rock very attractive but also very risky.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning big with Rock, many players either:\n1. Get confident and repeat the winning move\n2. Anticipate the obvious counter (Scissors) and switch to Paper\n\nGiven they seem strategic (played Rock effectively), I lean toward option 2 - they expect us to counter with Scissors, so they'll play Paper to counter our expected Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they play Paper expecting our Scissors, we should play Scissors anyway since:\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1 for us)\n- Even if they stick with Rock, we only lose 1 point (better than the -3 we just took)\n- It's the \"obvious\" counter to their successful Rock play\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Scissors is our safest play with decent upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - to counter their likely Paper (if they're anticipating our counter to Rock) or to properly counter Rock if they repeat it, with minimal downside risk.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie)  \n- Round 2: They Rock, We Paper (they win +3)\n- Round 3: Both Scissors (tie)\n\nThey're currently ahead +3 to our -3 (6-point spread). The opponent is clearly strategic and seems to be thinking similarly to us, but they capitalized when we made our error in round 2.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent's behavior suggests they're playing a mixed strategy or trying to be unpredictable. Two ties and one decisive win shows they're not just randomly throwing moves. They might be thinking:\n1. \"I'm ahead, I can afford to play it safe\"\n2. \"They're behind and desperate, they might go for Rock (the high-reward move)\"\n3. \"What would I do if I were down 6 points?\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If I were behind 6 points, I'd be tempted to use Rock for its +3 potential to quickly close the gap. Will they expect this and counter with Scissors?\n\n**Game Theorist:** That's a key insight. Being behind creates pressure to use Rock for catch-up points. But if they anticipate this, they'll play Scissors to counter our expected Rock. However, there's another layer: if they think we'll expect them to counter with Scissors, we might play Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\nBut let's consider their mindset being ahead: they might want to maintain their lead safely rather than risk the -3 penalty from Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players who are ahead often become more conservative. They might avoid Rock (high risk/reward) and lean toward Paper or Scissors. But they also know we need to catch up, so they're probably expecting us to take risks.\n\nIf they expect us to play Rock (for catch-up), they'll play Scissors.\nIf they expect us to think they'll counter with Scissors, they might play Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is getting complex. Let me think simply: what gives us the best expected value regardless of their specific choice?\n\n**Game Theorist:** Looking at our payoffs against each possibility:\n- If they play Rock: our Scissors wins +1, our Paper loses -3, our Rock ties 0\n- If they play Paper: our Scissors wins +1, our Paper ties 0, our Rock wins +3  \n- If they play Scissors: our Scissors ties 0, our Paper loses -1, our Rock wins +1\n\nScissors gives us the most consistent positive or neutral outcomes across all scenarios!\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - it offers the most balanced risk/reward profile, winning against both Rock and Paper while only tying against itself.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent has now played Rock twice (rounds 2 and 4), suggesting they're comfortable using the high-reward move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Very telling pattern! The opponent played Rock in rounds 2 and 4 - they're clearly drawn to that +3 reward potential. But they also showed restraint in round 3 with Scissors when we both played it.\n\nNow they've seen us successfully counter Rock with Scissors. They might:\n1. Avoid Rock since we just countered it\n2. Expect us to play Scissors again (since it just worked) and counter with Paper\n3. Still be tempted by Rock's +3 potential despite the risk\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've used Rock twice now and lost to our Scissors once. If they're strategic, they might shift away from Rock temporarily. What's our best move?\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they avoid Rock and expect us to play Scissors again (since it just worked), they'll likely play Paper to counter our expected Scissors. This creates an opportunity:\n\nIf they play Paper (expecting our Scissors), we should play Scissors anyway because:\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1 for us)\n- It's the logical follow-up to our successful Rock counter\n- Even if they surprise us with Rock again, we only lose 1 point\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also a psychological factor: players often develop patterns. They played Rock-Scissors-Rock. If they're following some internal logic, they might continue this pattern or break it deliberately. But the safer assumption is they'll try to counter our successful Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they counter our expected Scissors with Paper, we should play Scissors to beat their Paper. And if they stick with Rock despite the risk, we're prepared to counter it again.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Exactly. Scissors is our strongest move here - it counters both their most likely plays (Paper and Rock) while only risking a tie against Scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - to beat their likely Paper (if they're countering our expected repeat) or to counter Rock again if they're still drawn to the high reward.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They successfully predicted we'd stick with Scissors and countered with Paper. This opponent is very strategic!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Look at their sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper. They're mixing moves intelligently and seem to be reading our patterns well. After seeing us successfully counter Rock with Scissors in round 4, they correctly anticipated we'd repeat Scissors and countered with Paper.\n\nThey're now comfortably ahead by 7 points. From their perspective, they might:\n1. Play more conservatively to protect their lead\n2. Continue trying to read our patterns \n3. Expect us to get desperate and go for Rock (the +3 move)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Being 7 points behind, I'm definitely feeling pressure to use Rock for its +3 potential. But will they expect this?\n\n**Game Theorist:** That's exactly the trap! They probably expect us to go for Rock now that we're significantly behind. If they expect Rock, they'll play Scissors to counter it.\n\nBut there's another angle: they just used Paper successfully. Will they stick with what worked, or switch expecting us to counter their Paper with Scissors?\n\nLooking at their pattern: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper... if there's any cycling, the next might be Scissors or Rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** With a 7-point lead, they can afford to take some risks. They might actually go for Rock themselves, thinking:\n1. We're behind and desperate\n2. We might play Paper (to counter expected Rock) \n3. They could score +3 and put the game away\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have two main scenarios:\n- They expect our desperate Rock and play Scissors to counter\n- They go for Rock themselves to extend their lead\n\nIf they play Scissors (expecting our Rock), we should play Rock anyway - we lose only 1 point.\nIf they play Rock (going aggressive), we should play Scissors to counter for +1.\n\nWait... that suggests Rock is our best move either way!\n\n**Game Theorist:** Exactly! Rock gives us:\n- Only -1 if they counter with Scissors  \n- +3 if they also play Rock (tie becomes impossible since Rock vs Rock is tie = 0 points, I made an error)\n- +3 if they play Paper\n\nActually, let me recalculate: Rock vs Rock = tie = 0 points. So if they play Rock, we tie. If they play Paper, we win +3. If they play Scissors, we lose -1.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - we need the +3 potential to catch up, and even if they counter with Scissors, we only lose 1 point.

The question is: will they expect us to stick with Paper or switch?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're both clearly trying to outthink each other. After tying on Paper, what's their likely next move?\n\n**Game Theorist:** After the Paper tie, they might think:\n1. \"We're both playing Paper - will they stick with it?\" \n2. \"They're still behind - they might switch to Rock for the +3\"\n3. \"I should play Scissors to counter their likely Rock\"\n\nBut there's another angle: they might expect us to think they'll counter with Scissors, so they could play Paper again to beat our potential Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's a psychological phenomenon called \"frequency illusion\" - after repeated ties, players sometimes stick with what \"feels safe.\" But strategic players break patterns deliberately. Given they're ahead, they might take the calculated risk of playing Scissors to counter our desperate Rock attempt.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they play Scissors (expecting our Rock), we should play Rock anyway since we only lose 1 point but it shows we're not completely predictable. Or we could play Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Actually, if they play Scissors expecting our Rock, we should play Paper to beat their Scissors for +1. This chips away at their lead safely. Even if they surprise us with Rock, we only lose 3 points - and we need to take some risks being this far behind.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - to beat their likely Scissors (if they're countering our expected desperate Rock play) and safely gain a point toward closing the gap.\n\n[move] Paper"

And it keeps working because they time it well.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent is excellent at reading us. They correctly predicted our Paper in round 8 and punished us with Rock for the maximum +3. They're now so far ahead they can afford to take risks, but they're also showing they prefer Rock when they sense opportunity.\n\nWith a 13-point lead, they might:\n1. Play conservatively to protect their massive lead\n2. Continue with Rock since it's been so successful  \n3. Expect us to get extremely desperate and try to counter accordingly\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At 13 points behind, I'm definitely desperate. I need to start winning rounds consistently, and Rock offers the only +3 opportunity. But they'll expect this desperation...\n\n**Game Theorist:** Here's the brutal math: Even if we win every remaining round with +1 moves, we'd need 13 more rounds just to tie. We MUST hit some +3 Rock victories or this is hopeless.\n\nBut they've used Rock 4 times now - they know its power and timing. They might expect our desperation Rock and counter with Scissors.\n\nHowever, there's a contrarian thought: maybe they'll stick with what's working (Rock) thinking we'll try to counter with Scissors, in which case both playing Rock gives us a tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** When players are this far ahead, they sometimes get overconfident or stick with winning patterns. They might try Rock again. But they're also smart enough to potentially expect our desperate Rock attempt.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think we have to take the Rock risk. Even if they counter with Scissors and we lose 1 point, we can't win this game playing it safe. We need those +3 opportunities.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. We're at the point where we must gamble. Rock gives us the only realistic path back into this game.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - we're too far behind to play safely.

This is clearly their preferred strategy, and it's working.\n\nWe've tied 5 out of 9 rounds, which shows we're thinking similarly, but they've capitalized on the decisive rounds better.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent has a clear Rock preference and excellent timing. They just played Rock twice in a row (rounds 8 and 9). With such a massive lead, they might:\n\n1. Continue with Rock since it's been their winning strategy\n2. Expect us to finally counter their Rock pattern with Scissors\n3. Switch to Paper to counter our expected Scissors\n\nThe key insight: they're so far ahead they can afford to stick with what works (Rock) rather than overthink it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've used Rock 5 times and it's given them this huge lead. Being 13 points behind, I need to either successfully counter their likely Rock with Scissors, or hope they switch and I can get lucky with Rock myself.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Here's the strategic analysis:\n- If they play Rock again (56% of their moves so far), our Scissors wins +1\n- If they switch to Paper (expecting our Scissors), our Scissors wins +1  \n- If they play Scissors (expecting our Rock), our Scissors ties 0\n\nScissors has the best expected value! It beats their most likely move (Rock) and also beats Paper if they're trying to counter our expected counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After back-to-back Rocks, many players either continue the pattern or break it deliberately.

They're heavily Rock-biased, and we just tied with them on Rock again. That's 6 ties total out of 11 rounds - we're thinking very similarly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We've now tied on Rock three times (rounds 6, 9, 11). They clearly love Rock as much as we're being forced to use it. But here's the key insight: they just went back to Rock after successfully using Paper to counter our Scissors in round 10.\n\nThis suggests they view Rock as their \"home base\" strategy. After tactical moves, they return to Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Still 15 points behind with no progress. We absolutely need those +3 Rock victories. The question is: will they stick with Rock again, or do they expect us to keep trying Rock and counter with Scissors?\n\n**Game Theorist:** Looking at their recent sequence: Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock. There's a pattern of Rock preference interrupted by tactical counters. If they think we'll continue with Rock (since we're desperate for +3), they might finally use Scissors to counter us.\n\nBut there's another possibility: they might stick with Rock thinking we'll try to counter with Scissors, leading to another tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three Rock ties, there might be psychological momentum toward Rock for both players. But they're smart - they might break this pattern by expecting our continued Rock desperation and playing Scissors.\n\nHowever, if they play Scissors and we play Rock, we only lose 1 point. Given our massive deficit, this is a risk we can afford.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We have to keep trying Rock. It's our only path to +3 victories.

But 12 points is still a massive gap.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a crucial psychological moment! They just lost 3 points to our Rock, which might shake their confidence or make them more defensive. They might be thinking:\n\n1. \"They finally got their Rock win - will they try it again?\"\n2. \"I need to counter their likely Rock repeat with Scissors\"\n3. \"Maybe I should go back to my successful Rock strategy\"\n\nThe key insight: after giving up 3 points, they might become more cautious or try to immediately counter our \"lucky\" Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just lost 3 points to our Rock. Will they expect us to get greedy and try Rock again, leading them to counter with Scissors?\n\n**Game Theorist:** That's the most likely scenario. After losing to Rock, most players immediately think \"counter with Scissors next time.\" If they play Scissors expecting our Rock repeat, what should we do?\n\n- If they play Scissors (expecting our Rock): our Paper wins +1, our Rock loses -1, our Scissors ties 0\n- If they stick with Paper: our Scissors wins +1, our Rock wins +3, our Paper ties 0  \n- If they go to Rock: our Scissors wins +1, our Paper loses -3, our Rock ties 0\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing to Rock, there's often a knee-jerk reaction to counter it.

What does this tell us about their next move?\n\n**Game Theorist:** Their pattern suggests they'll stick with Paper/Rock exchanges. After the Paper tie, they might:\n1. Try Rock (tied for their most-used move)\n2. Stick with Paper since we just tied  \n3. Finally break pattern with Scissors (but history suggests unlikely)\n\nIf they play Paper or Rock, our Scissors beats both for +1. Even if they finally use Scissors, we only tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their psychological profile shows extreme Scissors avoidance - they'd rather lose with \"comfortable\" moves than win with Scissors. This creates an opportunity: Scissors beats both their preferred options.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors seems optimal here. It beats their likely Paper or Rock choices, and even if they break their strong pattern to use Scissors, we only tie. We need to keep gaining points.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Their behavioral pattern creates a favorable situation for Scissors. We beat their two most likely moves and don't lose even in the worst case.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - to beat their likely Paper or Rock choices, exploiting their continued Scissors avoidance pattern. This gives us the best expected value.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Even after we've now beaten their Rock twice with different moves (our Rock beat their Paper in rounds 12 & 15, our Scissors just beat their Rock), they continue avoiding Scissors.\n\nThey seem to prefer familiar Rock/Paper battles even when losing, rather than embrace Scissors strategy.

Finally use Scissors (extremely unlikely based on 5.9% historical usage)\n\nIf they play Paper expecting our Scissors, we should play Scissors anyway - it beats Paper for +1 and continues our momentum.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their pattern suggests they'll either counter tactically with Paper or return to their Rock comfort zone.

We've beaten their Rock with Scissors THREE consecutive times (rounds 17, 18, 19) and they KEEP PLAYING ROCK! \n\nThis is beyond pattern preference - this is pathological inability to adapt.
