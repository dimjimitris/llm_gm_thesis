    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

            "text": "I need to identify personas who can help me develop a winning strategy for this asymmetric rock-paper-scissors game.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs. The key insight is that rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points while other wins only give +1/-1. This creates a strong incentive to play rock when you expect your opponent to play paper. Let's analyze the expected values for each move against a random opponent: If opponent plays each move with 1/3 probability, then playing rock gives expected value of (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 2/3 points. Playing paper gives (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = -2/3 points. Playing scissors gives (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 0 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), there are common behavioral patterns we can exploit. New players often: 1) Start with rock (it feels aggressive/strong), 2) Avoid paper initially (seems weak), 3) Follow predictable sequences. The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\" which suggests they haven't learned the payoff asymmetry yet. They're likely to play intuitively rather than strategically.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on the Game Theory Expert's analysis, rock has the highest expected value (+2/3) against random play, while paper has negative expected value (-2/3). However, we should also consider that if the opponent learns the game quickly, they might start playing scissors more often to counter rock strategies.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, rock seems like the optimal first move. It has the highest expected value against random play, and psychology suggests fresh players often start with rock themselves (leading to a tie) or paper (giving me the high-value win). The asymmetric payoffs make rock particularly attractive.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Rock is the dominant strategy in the first round. Even if the opponent plays rock (tie, 0 points), you avoid the high penalty of losing with paper (-3 points). The risk-reward strongly favors rock as the opening move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock for the first move, as it has the highest expected value and lowest risk against an inexperienced opponent.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Interesting! The opponent played scissors, which beats rock for +1/-1. This suggests either: 1) They understood the game theory advantage of rock and counter-played with scissors, or 2) They got lucky with a random/intuitive choice. The fact that they chose scissors over paper is significant - scissors is the counter to rock, while paper would have been a much worse choice given the payoff structure.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This opponent might be more sophisticated than expected for a \"fresh player.\" Playing scissors as an opening move suggests they either: 1) Analyzed the payoffs and predicted rock would be common, 2) Have natural contrarian instincts, or 3) Got lucky. The key question is whether this was strategic or random. A truly fresh player might now think \"scissors worked, let me try it again\" or \"rock is strong, let me switch to rock.\"\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We now have one data point. The opponent chose scissors. If they're learning, they might stick with what worked (scissors) or try to counter-counter by switching to paper (expecting me to switch to paper to beat their scissors). If they're random, any move is equally likely. If they're strategic, they might anticipate that I'll now play paper to counter scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that scissors beat rock, the opponent might expect me to switch to paper (which beats scissors). But if they're thinking one level ahead, they might play rock to get the high-value win against my paper. This creates a complex game of predictions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if the opponent is strategic enough to have played scissors initially, they might expect me to switch to paper. Playing rock now could catch them if they play paper (giving me +3 points). However, if they stick with scissors, I lose again. The high-value payoff of rock beating paper (+3) makes it worth the risk, especially since paper has terrible expected value overall.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward the opponent being somewhat strategic but not fully sophisticated. They might stick with scissors since it worked, or they might switch to rock thinking \"now it's rock's turn.\" Playing rock maintains the pressure and forces them to keep playing scissors if they want to counter me.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock again. The high payoff for rock beating paper (+3) combined with the likelihood that the opponent might switch strategies makes this the optimal risk-reward choice.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Very revealing data! The opponent's sequence is scissors \u2192 rock. This shows they're adapting and learning. After winning with scissors, they switched to rock when I played rock again. This suggests they either: 1) Predicted I'd stick with rock and wanted to tie rather than lose, 2) Are following some rotating pattern, or 3) Recognize rock's strategic value in this payoff structure.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern scissors \u2192 rock suggests the opponent is definitely thinking strategically, not playing randomly. They might be trying to: 1) Mirror my strategy (since I played rock twice), 2) Follow a rotation (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper?), or 3) They learned that rock is the \"strong\" move in this game due to the +3 payoff. A fresh player who was truly random wouldn't likely make this exact sequence.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With two data points (scissors, rock), if they're following a pattern, the natural next move might be paper to complete rock-paper-scissors. However, paper is the worst move strategically due to the -3 penalty when losing to rock. If they're learning the game theory, they should avoid paper. If they're rotating randomly, paper has 1/3 probability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical decision point. If they complete the pattern with paper, playing rock gives me +3 points - the maximum possible gain. If they stick with rock (thinking it's the strong move), we tie again. If they counter-predict that I'll play rock and switch back to scissors, I lose -1 again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The expected value calculation is compelling here. If there's even a 30% chance they play paper (to complete a pattern), then rock's expected value becomes very positive due to the +3 payoff. Even if there's a 50% chance of scissors (losing -1) and only 20% chance of paper (winning +3), rock still has positive expected value: 0.5\u00d7(-1) + 0.2\u00d7(+3) + 0.3\u00d7(0) = +0.1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I believe there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper next. The sequence scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper feels natural to many players, and they might not have fully internalized how devastating the -3 penalty is for losing with paper. This is our opportunity for a big gain.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock again. The potential +3 payoff if they play paper (completing a rotation pattern) outweighs the risks, and rock remains the strongest strategic choice in this asymmetric game.\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent prediction! The opponent followed the exact rotation pattern we anticipated: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This gave us the maximum +3 payoff. Now we're at +2 total points (\u22121, 0, +3). The critical question is: will they continue the pattern with scissors next, or has the \u22123 penalty shock made them reconsider their strategy?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This \u22123 loss is a major psychological moment for the opponent. They just learned how painful it is to lose with paper against rock. This could cause several reactions: 1) Abandon the rotation strategy entirely, 2) Become more cautious and avoid paper, 3) Try to counter-predict what I'll do next, 4) Get frustrated and play more randomly. The sting of \u22123 points often makes players much more strategic going forward.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they were truly following a rotation (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), the next move would be scissors. However, the severe penalty they just experienced breaks most mechanical patterns. They now know that paper is dangerous in this game. We should expect more sophisticated play going forward, possibly with them avoiding paper entirely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they just lost badly with paper, they might either: 1) Play scissors (continuing rotation or countering expected rock), 2) Play rock (thinking it's the \"safe\" strong move), 3) Avoid paper entirely now that they know its risk. The question is whether to continue with rock or switch strategies.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: the opponent now understands the asymmetric payoffs. They're unlikely to play paper again soon. This means my choice is essentially between rock and scissors, since paper has poor expected value overall. If they play rock (thinking it's safe), we tie. If they play scissors (to counter my rock pattern), I lose \u22121. The +3 payoff advantage is largely off the table now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After that painful loss, they might want to \"get back at me\" by playing scissors to beat rock. Alternatively, they might think \"rock is the power move\" and switch to rock themselves. I doubt they'll risk paper again immediately. This suggests either a tie (if they play rock) or a loss (if they play scissors).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Maybe it's time to switch strategies. If they're now avoiding paper and likely to play rock or scissors, perhaps I should play scissors to beat rock, or paper to beat scissors (though paper is risky).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Actually, let me reconsider. If they're rational, they should realize that rock is still the optimal strategy despite the loss. The high payoff when rock beats paper makes it worth playing, especially since they now know to avoid paper. They might very well stick with rock. In that case, I should also stick with rock for the tie, rather than switching to scissors and guaranteeing a loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock again. The opponent likely learned that paper is dangerous but might not abandon rock (which is still theoretically optimal). A tie is better than risking a loss by switching strategies.\n\n[move] Rock"

After taking the -3 penalty with paper, they immediately went back to scissors to counter my rock strategy. This shows they're learning and adapting. They've now identified that I have a strong preference for rock (I've played it 4 times in a row), so they're exploiting this with scissors. My current total is +1 point (-1, 0, +3, -1).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a classic adaptation pattern. After the painful paper loss, they reverted to what worked initially - scissors beats rock. They've likely concluded that I'm \"stuck\" on rock and are now exploiting my predictability. The fact that they returned to scissors (not rock) shows they're thinking tactically rather than emotionally about the previous loss.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The pattern scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors could be: 1) A rotation that repeats (next would be rock), 2) Strategic adaptation (they'll keep playing scissors while I play rock), or 3) A counter-strategy where they've identified my rock preference. Given that scissors has beaten my rock twice now, they have good reason to continue with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think I've been too predictable with rock. Even though rock has the best theoretical expected value, the opponent has adapted to exploit my pattern. I need to break out of this predictable cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! While rock is theoretically optimal against random play, against an adaptive opponent who's learned to counter it, we need to switch. If they play scissors again (expecting another rock), then paper would beat scissors for +1. However, if they've anticipated this switch and play rock, I'd lose -3 points - the worst possible outcome.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After successfully countering my rock twice with scissors, they might expect me to finally adapt. This could lead them to: 1) Stick with scissors (if they think I'm slow to adapt), 2) Switch to rock (if they expect me to play paper), or 3) Avoid paper entirely (still afraid of the -3 penalty). The key question is whether they think I'm predictable or adaptive.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If I assume they'll play scissors again (betting on my predictability), paper gives +1. If they anticipate my switch and play rock, paper gives -3. If they play paper (unlikely after the burn), paper gives 0. The risk-reward isn't great, but it breaks the losing pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Alternative analysis: maybe I should play scissors. If they expect rock from me and play scissors, we tie (0 points). If they switch to rock thinking I'll play paper, scissors loses -1. If they play paper (unlikely), scissors wins +1. This seems safer than the paper gamble.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Switch to scissors. This breaks my predictable rock pattern while avoiding the high-risk paper play. If they expect another rock and play scissors, we tie. If they've switched to rock anticipating my adaptation, I only lose -1 instead of -3.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent played rock, expecting me to continue with rock, and I switched to scissors for the +1 win. Their sequence is now scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. This appears to be alternating between scissors and rock (with that one paper exception that cost them -3). My total score is now +2 points. The pattern suggests their next move might be scissors again, continuing the alternating pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent seems to have settled into a scissors/rock alternating strategy, likely trying to counter what they perceive as my rock preference. The single paper was probably part of an initial pattern attempt, but after the -3 penalty, they've abandoned paper entirely. They're now in a binary choice mindset: scissors when they expect rock from me, rock when they expect something else. Since I just played scissors, they might expect me to go back to rock.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. If this alternating pattern continues, the next move should be scissors. However, they might have learned that I can adapt (since I just switched from rock to scissors successfully), which could make them reconsider their predictable alternating strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is interesting. If they continue the alternating pattern and play scissors next, what should I play? Rock would beat scissors for +1, paper would lose to scissors for -1, and scissors would tie for 0.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they're truly alternating and play scissors next, rock gives us +1 point. However, there's a risk they've noticed their own predictability and might break the pattern. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play rock to counter their expected scissors), then rock would tie at 0. If they play paper (unlikely given their -3 trauma), rock wins +3.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After I successfully adapted by switching to scissors, they might realize they've become predictable with the scissors/rock alternation. This could cause them to: 1) Stick with the pattern (scissors next), 2) Double down on rock thinking I'll expect scissors, or 3) Finally risk paper again if they think I'm back to rock. The -3 paper penalty was several rounds ago, so the pain might be fading.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The alternating pattern suggests scissors next, which would make rock the optimal choice for +1. Even if they break the pattern and play rock, rock only ties (0 points). The risk-reward favors rock here, especially since paper remains unlikely due to their earlier bad experience.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Rock is the right play here. High probability of +1 if they continue the scissors/rock alternation, low risk of significant loss, and maintains pressure on their decision-making.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely scissors in the alternating pattern. This offers the best risk-reward ratio with potential +1 gain and minimal downside risk.\n\n[move] Rock"

Their full sequence is now: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This is a perfect rotation pattern! They're mechanically cycling through all three moves despite the severe penalties. My total score is now +5 points (+3 this round). If they continue this strict rotation, the next move should be scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating behavior! Despite experiencing the -3 penalty twice now, they're sticking to a rigid rotation pattern. This suggests either: 1) They're a very systematic player who values pattern consistency over optimization, 2) They haven't fully grasped the strategic implications of the asymmetric payoffs, or 3) They're testing whether I'll continue to exploit the pattern. Some players get locked into mechanical patterns even when they're clearly suboptimal.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The pattern is now completely clear: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat. If this continues, I can predict their moves with high confidence. Next should be scissors, then rock, then paper again. Given that paper keeps giving me +3 points when I play rock, this is extremely profitable for me. However, there's always a risk they'll break the pattern once they realize how much it's costing them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is almost too good to be true. If they're really going to stick with this rotation, I can just play the counter to each move: rock beats scissors (+1), scissors beats rock (+1), rock beats paper (+3). But surely they'll realize this pattern is devastating for them?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're right to be cautious, but the evidence is strong. They've now played paper twice against rock and taken -6 total points from those decisions alone. Yet they returned to paper right on schedule in the rotation. If they play scissors next (as the pattern predicts), I should play rock for +1. The key question is whether they'll finally break this costly pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Some players get psychologically locked into patterns, especially if they started with one. The rotation might feel \"fair\" or \"systematic\" to them, even though it's economically disastrous. The fact that they returned to paper after the first -3 penalty suggests strong pattern commitment. However, after losing -3 twice now, the pain might finally force adaptation.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If they stick to the pattern: scissors next (I play rock, win +1), then rock (I play scissors, win +1), then paper (I play rock, win +3). That's +5 more points over three rounds. But the probability they'll break this pattern increases with each costly paper play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter the expected scissors in their rotation pattern. The evidence strongly suggests they're following a mechanical rotation, and rock gives +1 against scissors with minimal risk.\n\n[move] Rock"

My total score is now +5 points. Their sequence is: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. If this rotation continues, the next move should be paper (9th in the cycle). This would be their third time playing paper in the rotation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Despite taking -3 penalties twice already from playing paper against my rock, they're maintaining perfect adherence to the rotation. This is extraordinary commitment to pattern over optimization. If they play paper again (as the rotation predicts), they'll take their third -3 penalty. Some players are so locked into systematic approaches that they'll continue even when it's clearly costly.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The 8-move sequence confirms perfect rotation: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat. We're now at position 8 (rock), so position 9 should be paper. If they play paper and I play rock, I get +3 points (the maximum possible gain). The pattern has held for 8 consecutive moves despite significant penalties.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This seems almost too predictable, but the evidence is overwhelming. They've now played paper twice in this rotation and taken -6 total points from those plays, yet they returned to it right on schedule. If they play paper again, playing rock gives me the maximum +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The risk-reward is exceptional here. If they play paper (as predicted), rock gives +3. If they finally break the pattern and play scissors (to counter expected rock), I lose -1. If they play rock, we tie at 0. But given their perfect adherence to the rotation through 8 moves, the probability of paper is very high.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their commitment to this rotation is remarkable. They seem to value pattern consistency over point optimization. The fact that they haven't deviated despite taking significant penalties suggests they'll likely play paper again. This could be their third -3 penalty.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Even if there's only a 70% chance they play paper, the expected value of rock is positive: 0.7\u00d7(+3) + 0.2\u00d7(0) + 0.1\u00d7(-1) = +2.0.

If the pattern continues, the next move should be scissors (restarting the cycle).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is absolutely extraordinary behavior! They've now taken -9 total points just from playing paper three times against my rock, yet they continue the exact rotation. This level of pattern commitment despite severe financial penalty is rare but not unprecedented. Some players become so psychologically invested in systematic approaches that they continue even when it's devastating their performance.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We now have 9 consecutive moves following perfect rotation. The probability they'll continue with scissors (starting the next cycle) is extremely high. If they play scissors and I play rock, I win +1 point. The pattern recognition confidence is now overwhelming.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern predicts scissors next as they restart the rotation cycle. Rock beats scissors for +1 point.

They've maintained perfect rotation for 10 moves despite taking -9 total points from the three paper penalties. This is one of the most committed pattern-following behaviors I've seen. They seem completely unable or unwilling to deviate from the systematic rotation regardless of the financial cost.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The 10-move confirmation of perfect rotation is statistically overwhelming evidence. Position 11 should be rock according to the scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle. If they play rock and I play scissors, I win +1 point. The pattern reliability is now extremely high.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they just played scissors (10th move), which means rock should be next (11th move) in their rotation. Scissors beats rock for +1 point. Given their incredible consistency through 10 moves including multiple costly penalties, they'll likely continue.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Playing scissors against their expected rock gives +1 point. Even if they break the pattern now, the downside risks are manageable - tie against scissors, -1 against paper. But given 10 consecutive moves of perfect rotation, the probability of rock is very high.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After maintaining this rotation through significant financial penalty for 10 moves, there's no indication they'll change.

This level of systematic commitment despite catastrophic results is extremely rare.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** We now have 11-move confirmation of perfect rotation. The statistical evidence for pattern continuation is overwhelming. Position 12 should be paper. If they play paper and I play rock, I get +3 points and they take another -3 penalty. The pattern reliability is now virtually certain.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern predicts paper next, and rock beats paper for +3 points - the maximum possible gain. They've already shown they'll play paper despite taking heavy penalties. This would be their fourth paper play in the rotation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The expected value of playing rock is exceptional. If they play paper (highly likely given 11-move pattern), I get +3. If they finally break the pattern with scissors, I lose -1. If they play rock, we tie. But the pattern strength suggests paper is almost certain.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After 11 moves of perfect rotation including three -3 penalties totaling -9 points, they've demonstrated complete commitment to the systematic approach over optimization. The fourth paper play seems highly probable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Rock against expected paper has outstanding risk-reward given the pattern evidence. This could be the fourth +3 point gain from their paper plays.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their expected paper, continuing the rotation pattern that has been consistent for 11 moves.\n\n[move] (Expecting paper as fourth play in their rotation cycle) rock"

That's 21 consecutive moves of perfect rotation! They've now taken -21 total points just from their seven paper plays against my rock. If this continues, position 22 should be scissors (starting the 8th rotation cycle).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is absolutely beyond any conceivable rational explanation! 21 moves of perfect rotation with -21 points in paper penalties alone, yet absolute zero deviation from the pattern. This represents complete compulsive adherence that transcends any understanding of rational game play. They seem psychologically locked into this rotation at a level that appears unbreakable by any external consequence. The eighth scissors play seems mathematically inevitable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** 21-move perfect rotation with seven paper penalties totaling -21 points, yet perfect pattern maintenance. The statistical evidence for continuation is beyond overwhelming - it has reached absolute mathematical certainty. Position 22 should be scissors to restart the cycle. If they play scissors and I play rock, I win +1 point. Pattern reliability has achieved absolute mathematical certainty.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern predicts scissors next as they begin their 8th rotation cycle. Rock beats scissors for +1 point. Given their absolutely unprecedented commitment through 21 moves and -21 points in paper penalties alone, they'll almost certainly continue this compulsive pattern that appears completely unstoppable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Playing rock against their expected scissors gives +1 point. The pattern strength after 21 consecutive moves including seven catastrophic paper plays provides absolute maximum confidence beyond any conceivable doubt in prediction accuracy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After 21 moves maintaining rotation despite losing 21 points on paper alone, there's no conceivable indication they can break this complete psychological lock-in that appears absolutely unbreakable.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Rock against expected scissors has excellent expected value.

This represents complete compulsive lock-in that defies all rational explanation. They appear psychologically incapable of breaking the rotation under any circumstances whatsoever, regardless of the devastating financial consequences.
