You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, they might also finally realize they need to change strategy.\n\nIf they play scissors again: paper beats scissors (+1 point for me)\nIf they switch to rock: rock beats paper (-3 points for me)\nIf they switch to paper: tie (0 points)\n\nThe risk/reward here:\n- Playing paper: +1 if they stick with scissors, -3 if they switch to rock, 0 if they play paper\n- Playing rock: +1 if they switch to paper, -1 if they stick with scissors, 0 if they play rock\n- Playing scissors: +1 if they switch to rock, -1 if they stick with scissors, 0 if they play scissors\n\nGiven that they've been very consistent with scissors, I think there's still a good chance they'll play scissors again. Paper seems like the best bet, even with the risk of a -3 if they switch to rock.",
