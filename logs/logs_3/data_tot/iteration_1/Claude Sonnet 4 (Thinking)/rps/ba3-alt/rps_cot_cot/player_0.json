    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet.\n\n3. Against a random opponent (equal probability of each move), the expected values are:\n   - Rock: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = +2/3 points\n   - Paper: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = -2/3 points  \n   - Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 0 points\n\n4. Rock has the highest expected value against random play.\n\n5. Fresh players often don't have sophisticated counter-strategies to exploit the high-value rock move.\n\n6.

Opponent's defensive pattern analysis:\n   - They perfectly counter paper with rock (3/3 times)\n   - They've tied scissors twice in a row (defensive play)\n   - They seem to prioritize preventing my wins over maximizing their own\n\n3. Breaking the tie pattern:\n   - Two consecutive scissors ties suggest they might expect me to play scissors again\n   - If they expect scissors and want to beat it, they'd play rock\n   - I need high-value wins to recover from -6 deficit\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point) if they continue expecting my scissors\n   - Rock vs paper gives -3, but paper is less likely after two scissors ties\n   - Need to take calculated risks to recover points\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - At -6 points, I need wins, not just avoiding losses\n   - Rock offers the best potential recovery if they play scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely scissors expectation and break the tie cycle.\n\n[move] rock"

Current situation analysis:\n   - Just WON round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +1 point\n   - Total score: -18 points\n   - First win in many rounds - finally broke their counter-pattern!\n\n2. Opponent's response to being beaten:\n   - They played rock (probably expecting my paper switch after rock losses)\n   - My scissors beat their rock - they might adjust their strategy\n   - They may want to counter my successful scissors play\n\n3. Predicting their counter-response:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since I just won with it)\n   - To beat scissors, they would need to play paper\n   - They haven't played paper since round 5 (17 rounds ago)\n\n4. High-value opportunity:\n   - If they play paper (to counter expected scissors): rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - This would be my biggest possible score recovery from -18\n   - They may finally break their defensive patterns after losing\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs paper: +3 points (maximum reward if they counter my scissors)\n   - Rock vs scissors: -1 point (if they revert to counter-pattern)\n   - Rock vs rock: 0 points (neutral)\n   - At -18 deficit, high-reward opportunities are essential\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to exploit their likely paper counter to my successful scissors strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

Current situation analysis:\n   - Just had round 23: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 tie, 0 points\n   - Total score: -18 points\n   - This is the second consecutive rock tie (rounds 18, 23)\n\n2. Opponent's recent strategy shift:\n   - They've moved away from pure counter-strategy to more mixed play\n   - Two recent rock ties suggest they're playing more defensively\n   - They may be continuing with rock-focused strategy\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Paper counter: Still 100% reliable (7/7 times they counter my paper with rock)\n   - But they just played rock twice, suggesting possible strategy change\n   - They might not expect paper since they're playing rock themselves\n\n4. High-reward opportunity:\n   - If they continue rock trend: paper beats rock (+3 points)\n   - This would be significant recovery from -18 deficit\n   - Their recent rock plays suggest they may continue this pattern\n\n5. Critical risk assessment:\n   - Paper vs rock: +3 points (if they continue rock strategy)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 point (less likely given recent rock focus)\n   - At -18 points, I must take calculated risks for maximum recovery\n   - Their strategy shift away from pure countering creates opportunity\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to exploit their apparent shift to rock-focused strategy and achieve maximum score recovery.\n\n[move] paper"
