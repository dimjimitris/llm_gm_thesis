They might be trying to counter what they think I'll play next, or they could have some pattern. Since they just played rock and we tied, they might switch to something else. \n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper beats rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nThe highest reward is paper beating rock at +3 points. If I think they might play rock again, paper would be great. But they might anticipate that I'll try paper again (since I started with it) and play scissors to counter.\n\nThey've shown scissors and rock so far. If they're cycling through moves, paper might be next. If I play scissors, I'd beat their paper and get +1.\n\nLet me think about this differently - what's my best expected value play? If they're playing randomly:\n- If I play rock: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs rock) = Expected value = (1-3+0)/3 = -2/3\n- If I play paper: 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of +3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs paper) = Expected value = (-1+3+0)/3 = +2/3\n- If I play scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs scissors) = Expected value = (1-1+0)/3 = 0\n\nSo if opponent is playing randomly, paper has the highest expected value due to the high payoff when it wins.\n \nI'll strategically choose scissors to potentially catch their next move and disrupt their pattern.",

          "reasoning_text": "The opponent has been following a perfect cycle: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper... and so on. They've been completely predictable throughout all the rounds we've played.\n\nFollowing this pattern, their next move should be paper. I should play scissors to beat paper and score 1 point.\n\nThe pattern has been:\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3) \n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n- Paper (I beat with scissors, +1)\n- Scissors (I beat with rock, +1)\n- Rock (I beat with paper, +3)\n\nSo the next should be paper, and I should play scissors.",
