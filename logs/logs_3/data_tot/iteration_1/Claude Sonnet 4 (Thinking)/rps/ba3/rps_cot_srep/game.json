Analyze the payoff structure: Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, though it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they may not have developed patterns yet. Many new players tend to default to rock on their first move.\n\n3. Calculate expected value: If I assume equal probability for all opponent moves, paper has the best expected value (+2/3 points vs -2/3 for rock and 0 for scissors).\n\n4. Consider risk vs reward: Paper offers the highest potential gain, and if my opponent follows common beginner patterns, rock is likely.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to maximize my potential points, especially given that new players often start with rock.\n\n[move] paper"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Playing rock carries the highest penalty risk (-3) if opponent happens to play paper\n\nMy reasoning: Since paper offers the highest potential reward and the opponent is described as \"fresh,\" they may not be aware of the scoring asymmetry and could easily choose rock.

Expected value analysis assuming random opponent:\n   - Paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 1 + 0 - 0.33 = 0.67\n   - Rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*1 = 0 - 1 + 0.33 = -0.67\n   - Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = -0.33 + 0.33 + 0 = 0\n\nI'll choose paper as it has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nWhen facing a new player, they typically default to rock, which means paper would give me a significant advantage of +3 points. This strategic insight further confirms paper as the optimal choice.",

Go back to their most frequent recent move: rock\n\nGiven that they just lost twice with scissors, they're more likely to switch. Rock has been their most common move in this adaptive phase, so there's a good chance they'll return to rock.\n\nIf they play rock, paper beats rock for +3 points (maximum reward).\nIf they stick with scissors, I lose with paper (-1).\nIf they play paper, I lose with paper (tie = 0, wait no, same move = tie = 0 points).\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. They've been somewhat predictable in sticking with moves that work and switching away from moves that don't work recently. Scissors just lost twice, so they're likely to switch.\n\nRock seems most probable given its frequency in their recent play.",
