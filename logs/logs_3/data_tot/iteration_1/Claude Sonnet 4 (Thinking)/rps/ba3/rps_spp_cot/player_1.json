    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They might think I'll expect them to stick with paper, but their 62% paper rate suggests they consistently return to it despite strategic considerations.\n\n5. Recent behavior: Even after learning to counter my scissors with rock, they went right back to paper. This shows their paper bias is very strong.\n\n6.

Pattern observation: We just had two consecutive ties - paper-paper, then scissors-scissors. This creates psychological pressure to break the tie cycle.\n\n4. Psychology after double ties: Fresh players often try the \"unused\" option to break frustrating tie patterns. They might think \"we keep tying on paper and scissors, let me try rock.\"\n\n5.

Critical observation: We just had THREE consecutive ties - paper-paper, scissors-scissors, paper-paper. This level of frustration is unprecedented.\n\n4. Psychology of extreme frustration: After three ties in a row, both players are likely desperate to break the pattern. The natural impulse is to try the move that hasn't appeared in this recent sequence.\n\n5. Rock analysis: They've barely used rock (13% overall), making it the \"fresh\" option. After cycling through paper and scissors in ties, rock becomes the psychological \"break glass\" choice.\n\n6.
