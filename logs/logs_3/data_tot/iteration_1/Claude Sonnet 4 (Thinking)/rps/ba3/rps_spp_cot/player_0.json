    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Interesting data point! The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might be thinking strategically rather than just randomly. If they're also aware of paper's mathematical advantage, they might continue playing paper, or they might think we'll stick with paper and switch to scissors to counter us.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that they chose paper suggests a few possibilities: 1) They're thinking strategically like us, 2) They might have read about the game or received similar hints, 3) They could be using a \"copy the winner\" strategy from other games. Fresh players sometimes stick with what they perceive as strong moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We have a strategic dilemma. If they continue with paper (thinking it's optimal), we should play scissors for the +1 point. But if they think we'll stick with paper and they switch to scissors, we should switch to rock. The key question is: are they thinking one level deep (paper is good) or two levels deep (opponent expects paper, so I'll play scissors)?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they're more likely thinking one level deep. They discovered paper is mathematically superior and might stick with it, especially after a tie (which doesn't feel like a loss).\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If we assume they'll play paper again with 60% probability (sticking with perceived optimal), scissors 30% (countering our expected paper), and rock 10% (random):\n- Our Rock: 0.6*(-3) + 0.3*1 + 0.1*0 = -1.5\n- Our Paper: 0.6*0 + 0.3*(-1) + 0.1*3 = 0\n- Our Scissors: 0.6*1 + 0.3*0 + 0.1*(-1) = 0.5\n\nScissors has the highest expected value under these assumptions.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree.

This opponent is clearly not playing randomly or with typical \"fresh player\" patterns. They're either very strategically minded or using similar analytical reasoning to ours.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern suggests we're in a \"mind-reading\" scenario where both players are thinking multiple levels deep. Round 1: both chose the mathematically optimal paper. Round 2: both anticipated the opponent would stick with paper and chose scissors. Now for Round 3, the question is: what level are they thinking at?\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me model their behavior. They seem to be mirroring optimal strategic play perfectly. If they think we'll expect them to switch to rock (to beat our expected scissors), they might:\n- Stick with scissors (thinking we'll switch to rock)  \n- Switch to rock (straightforward counter to scissors)\n- Switch to paper (if they think we'll switch to rock to beat their expected scissors)\n\nThis is getting quite meta!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two ties, there might be psychological pressure to \"break the pattern.\" Many players feel compelled to switch after repeated ties. The opponent might switch to rock as the \"natural\" counter to scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the high strategic level shown by this opponent, I suspect they're thinking: \"We both played scissors, my opponent will expect me to play rock to counter their continued scissors, so I should play paper to beat their expected rock.\" This suggests they might play paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** If we assume: 40% chance they play paper (meta-thinking), 35% chance they play rock (direct counter), 25% chance they stick with scissors:\n- Our Rock: 0.4*(-3) + 0.35*0 + 0.25*1 = -0.95\n- Our Paper: 0.4*0 + 0.35*3 + 0.25*(-1) = 0.8  \n- Our Scissors: 0.4*1 + 0.35*(-1) + 0.25*0 = 0.05\n\nPaper has the highest expected value under this model.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree.

The pattern is: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. This opponent is definitely not a \"fresh player\" - they're playing at expert level and thinking through the same game theory we are.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of mirroring suggests we're dealing with either another AI system or a highly analytical human. The psychological pressure after three ties is interesting - both players might start feeling compelled to \"break\" the pattern or might double down on their analytical approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're in a recursive mind-reading scenario. They've shown they can think 2-3 levels deep consistently. For Round 4, key considerations:\n1. They might expect us to stick with paper (it's mathematically optimal)\n2. They might expect us to cycle (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors)\n3. They might expect us to overthink and switch to rock\n\nIf they think we'll stick with paper, they'd play scissors. If they think we'll cycle to scissors, they'd play rock. If they think we'll overthink to rock, they'd play paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at the sequence pattern: P-S-P-?. If it's alternating Paper/Scissors, next would be Scissors. If they expect this pattern and think we'll play scissors, they'd counter with rock. Given their strategic sophistication, I estimate:\n- 45% they play rock (expecting us to cycle to scissors)\n- 35% they play scissors (expecting us to stick with paper)  \n- 20% they play paper (meta-thinking about our overthinking)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.45*0 + 0.35*1 + 0.2*(-3) = -0.25\n- Our Paper: 0.45*3 + 0.35*(-1) + 0.2*0 = 1.0\n- Our Scissors: 0.45*(-1) + 0.35*0 + 0.2*1 = -0.25\n\nPaper still has the highest expected value!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Interestingly, despite all the complex thinking, paper keeps coming out as optimal.

Let's trust the math and our analysis.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Stick with paper - it maintains the highest expected value even against sophisticated play.\n\n[move] (Despite the complex strategic mirroring, paper maintains mathematical superiority in this asymmetric game and covers us well against their most likely moves) paper"

This is statistically remarkable - the probability of four random ties is (1/3)^4 = 1/81. We're clearly dealing with another highly analytical player using similar game theory.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This creates a fascinating psychological situation. Both players are \"stuck\" in optimal play, creating a stable but pointless equilibrium. The frustration of getting 0 points repeatedly might push one player to finally deviate. They might be waiting for us to break first, or they might be the one to break.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're in what's called a \"mixed strategy equilibrium\" situation in practice. Both players have converged on the same analytical framework. The question is: should we continue playing optimally (paper) or should we try to exploit by assuming they'll get frustrated and switch?\n\nIf they stick with paper (thinking we will too), we tie at 0.\nIf they switch to scissors (finally exploiting our perceived paper bias), we lose -1.\nIf they switch to rock (random frustration), we win +3.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Here's a key insight: after four ties, they might finally think \"my opponent is clearly committed to paper, so I should play scissors to get my first points.\" This would be rational if they believe we're stuck in a pattern.\n\nLet me estimate: \n- 40% they stick with paper (continuing optimal play)\n- 50% they switch to scissors (exploiting our apparent paper preference)  \n- 10% they switch to rock (random/frustration)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.4*(-3) + 0.5*1 + 0.1*0 = -0.7\n- Our Paper: 0.4*0 + 0.5*(-1) + 0.1*3 = -0.2\n- Our Scissors: 0.4*1 + 0.5*0 + 0.1*(-1) = 0.3\n\nScissors actually has the highest expected value now!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's a compelling analysis.

After four ties, they stuck with paper while we correctly switched to scissors, earning us +1 point. Now we have valuable information about their decision-making process - they do eventually stick with patterns when they think their opponent will too.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This win changes the psychological dynamic significantly. They just got \"outsmarted\" and lost their first points (-1). This could trigger several responses:\n1. Frustration leading to more erratic play\n2. Respect for our strategic thinking, making them more cautious\n3. A desire to \"get revenge\" by countering our scissors with rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent now knows we're capable of breaking patterns strategically. They might think: \"My opponent just proved they can switch when optimal, so they might stick with scissors since it worked, which means I should play rock.\" But they might also think we're thinking this way and play something else.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given that we just won with scissors, I estimate their likely moves:\n- 55% they play rock (direct counter to our winning scissors)\n- 25% they play paper (going back to mathematical optimum)  \n- 20% they play scissors (copying our successful move)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.55*0 + 0.25*(-3) + 0.2*1 = -0.55\n- Our Paper: 0.55*3 + 0.25*0 + 0.2*(-1) = 1.45\n- Our Scissors: 0.55*(-1) + 0.25*1 + 0.2*0 = -0.3\n\nPaper has the highest expected value!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the psychological factor that they might want to \"reset\" to the mathematically optimal choice (paper) after taking a loss, especially since paper was working for so long.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Paper covers us well against their most likely move (rock) while also being the mathematically superior choice overall.

The pattern is now clear: they're reactive rather than proactive in their strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a critical psychological moment. They've now lost twice in a row with -4 points total. This level of consecutive losses can trigger significant behavioral changes:\n1. Desperation - they might start playing more randomly or aggressively\n2. Analysis paralysis - they might overthink even more\n3. Pattern recognition - they might finally realize we're predicting their moves\n4. Tilt - emotional decision making taking over rational analysis\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has shown a clear pattern: they're always one step behind our thinking.

They chose the same optimal move we did rather than the reactive scissors we expected. This suggests they're evolving their strategy - they're not just one step behind anymore. Our total is still +4, but they're adapting.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This tie might actually be a relief for them psychologically. After two painful losses (-1, then -3), a tie feels like \"not losing\" rather than just \"not winning.\" They may have broken out of their reactive pattern due to the pressure, or they're finally matching our analytical level.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Critical insight: they're no longer purely reactive. The sequence was:\n- Round 5: We predicted they'd stick with paper \u2192 They did, we won\n- Round 6: We predicted they'd play rock \u2192 They did, we won  \n- Round 7: We predicted they'd play scissors \u2192 They played rock instead\n\nThey're either getting better at game theory or becoming more unpredictable. This is actually more dangerous for us.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. After the tie with rock, they might:\n- 35% stick with rock (it didn't lose, so it feels \"safe\")\n- 40% switch to paper (return to mathematical optimum after psychological relief)\n- 25% try scissors (to mix up and become unpredictable)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.35*0 + 0.4*(-3) + 0.25*1 = -0.95\n- Our Paper: 0.35*3 + 0.4*0 + 0.25*(-1) = 0.8\n- Our Scissors: 0.35*(-1) + 0.4*1 + 0.25*0 = 0.05\n\nPaper has the highest expected value.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The psychology of the tie might push them back toward paper (feels safe and optimal), which makes paper our best choice for the potential +3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed.

We're at +4 total, but they've clearly adapted back to matching our strategic level.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a fascinating psychological battle. They went through a learning curve: started matching us perfectly, then fell behind for 2 rounds when we outmaneuvered them, and now they're back to matching us again. They've proven they can adapt and learn from losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're back in a high-level equilibrium where both players are thinking at similar strategic depths. The opponent has shown they can:\n1. Play optimally (early ties)\n2. Learn from losses (adapted after rounds 5-6)  \n3.

This is the second time we've beaten them with scissors against their paper (rounds 5 and 9), showing a clear pattern in our successful predictions.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This loss might be particularly frustrating for them because it's the same pattern as round 5 - we switched to scissors while they stuck with paper. They're now down 10 points total and may realize we're successfully predicting their paper plays. This could trigger a significant strategic shift.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Critical pattern recognition: We've now beaten them twice with the exact same move combination (our scissors vs their paper).

After this loss following 11 ties, they might completely rethink their approach.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After losing the tie-breaker with paper beaten by our scissors, they're likely thinking:\n- 55% play rock (counter our successful scissors - they might expect us to stick with what worked)\n- 30% play scissors (copy our winning move or try to counter our potential paper)  \n- 15% stick with paper (stubborn optimality despite repeated losses to our scissors)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.55*0 + 0.3*1 + 0.15*(-3) = -0.15\n- Our Paper: 0.55*3 + 0.3*(-1) + 0.15*0 = 1.35\n- Our Scissors: 0.55*(-1) + 0.3*0 + 0.15*1 = -0.4\n\nPaper has significantly higher expected value!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Perfect! If they counter our scissors with rock (most likely), paper gives us the maximum +3 points. This could extend our lead significantly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After being beaten by scissors three times, their most rational response is to counter with rock, making paper our optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter their likely rock response and potentially gain +3 points.\n\n[move] (The opponent has now lost to my scissors-beats-paper combination three times and will likely counter with rock, giving me a valuable +3 point opportunity with paper) paper"

They've demonstrated rapid learning and adaptation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary strategic evolution! They didn't just counter our scissors with rock as we predicted - they copied our winning strategy and used it against us. This shows incredible psychological resilience and strategic flexibility. After 11 ties and a loss, they immediately learned and adapted.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** CRITICAL INSIGHT: This opponent has just proven they can rapidly learn and mirror successful strategies.

This shows they can learn and adapt but also get attached to what works, making them predictable in the short term.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This win-loss-win pattern for them (won with scissors in round 17, lost to our rock in round 18) might create confusion. They successfully copied our strategy once, then immediately got countered when they tried to repeat it. This psychological whiplash between success and failure might make them overthink their next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Key insight: They demonstrated they can learn and adapt, but they also showed they can get caught in short-term pattern repetition. After being successful with scissors, they repeated it and got punished. Now they know we can predict their pattern repetition too.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After their scissors strategy got countered by our rock, they're likely thinking:\n- 45% play paper (counter our successful rock, and it's also mathematically optimal)  \n- 35% play rock (copy our winning move or expect us to stick with rock for a tie)\n- 20% stay with scissors (stubborn continuation or thinking we'll switch)\n\nExpected values for us:\n- Our Rock: 0.45*(-3) + 0.35*0 + 0.2*1 = -1.15\n- Our Paper: 0.45*0 + 0.35*3 + 0.2*(-1) = 0.85  \n- Our Scissors: 0.45*1 + 0.35*(-1) + 0.2*0 = 0.1\n\nPaper has the highest expected value.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They're most likely to either counter our rock with paper or return to mathematical optimality.
