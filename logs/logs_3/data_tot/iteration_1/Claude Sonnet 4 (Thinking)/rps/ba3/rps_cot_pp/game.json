Analyze the payoffs: Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), while other wins only give +1 point.\n\n2. Consider fresh player behavior: New players often choose rock as their first instinctive move since it's the most straightforward option.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward: If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3 points. If they choose scissors instead, I only lose -1 point.\n\n4. The potential high reward (+3) outweighs the relatively small risk (-1), making paper the optimal choice against a likely rock selection.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players commonly select first.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate risk vs reward: If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3 points. If they choose scissors instead, I only lose -1 point.\n\n4. The potential high reward (+3) outweighs the relatively small risk (-1), making paper the optimal choice against a likely rock selection.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players commonly select first.\n\n[move] paper",

Fresh players often don't have a strategy yet, so they might:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Go with their intuition\n3. Choose rock (it's often the first choice people make)\n\nLet me think about my options:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- I win against scissors (+1)\n- I lose against paper (-3) \n- I tie against rock (0)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- I win against rock (+3)\n- I lose against scissors (-1)\n- I tie against paper (0)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- I win against paper (+1)\n- I lose against rock (-1)\n- I tie against scissors (0)\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player, rock is often the most intuitive first choice for many people. If they choose rock, then paper would give me the maximum reward (+3 points).\n\nThe risk is that if they choose scissors instead, I'd lose 1 point. But the potential gain of +3 points from beating rock seems worth the risk of -1 from losing to scissors.\n\nSo my strategy for this first move will be to choose paper, betting that the fresh player will go with rock as their initial choice.",

I chose paper and my opponent chose scissors, so they got +1 and I got -1.\n\nNow I need to think about what this tells me about my opponent and what to do next.\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. My opponent chose scissors in the first round, not rock as I predicted. This suggests they might not be as predictable as a typical \"fresh\" player.\n\n2. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 vs -1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 vs -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 vs -1)\n\n3. What might my opponent do next? They just won with scissors. They might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it worked\n   - Switch to something else thinking I'll now counter scissors\n   - Try to anticipate what I'll do\n\n4. If I think they'll stick with scissors, I should choose rock (rock beats scissors for +1)\n   \n5. If I think they'll switch away from scissors, what would they switch to?\n   - They might choose rock, thinking I'll choose rock to counter their scissors\n   - They might choose paper\n\n6. The safest bet might be rock, since:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I win +1\n   - If they choose paper, I lose -3 (bad)\n   - If they choose rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Actually, let me think about this differently. What if they're trying to be unpredictable? In that case, any choice is equally likely.\n\n8. But given that they chose scissors first (which beat my paper), they might expect me to now choose rock to counter scissors. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might choose paper to beat my expected rock choice.\n\n9. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors.\n\n10. This is getting complex. Let me think about the expected values:\n    - If I choose rock: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs rock) = Expected value: (1-3+0)/3 = -2/3\n    - If I choose paper: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs paper) = Expected value: (3-1+0)/3 = +2/3\n    - If I choose scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs scissors) = Expected value: (1-1+0)/3 = 0\n\nI'll go with paper since it has the highest expected value.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.
