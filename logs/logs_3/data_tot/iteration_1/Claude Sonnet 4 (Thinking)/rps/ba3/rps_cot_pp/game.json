Consider the opponent: A \"fresh player\" likely doesn't know about this asymmetric scoring and may choose randomly or have natural biases (many people instinctively start with rock).\n\n3. Calculate expected values: If the opponent chooses randomly:\n   - Playing paper: Expected value of +2/3 points (high reward vs rock, small penalty vs scissors)\n   - Playing scissors: Expected value of 0 points \n   - Playing rock: Expected value of -2/3 points (large penalty vs paper)\n\n4. Consider that fresh players often favor rock initially, making paper even more attractive.\n\n5.

This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nLet me think about the strategy:\n\nSteps to consider:\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix to understand the best potential outcomes\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do\n3. Determine the optimal move based on expected value\n\nStep 1: Payoff analysis\n- If I play paper and win (opponent plays rock), I get +3 points - this is the highest possible reward\n- If I play rock and win (opponent plays scissors), I get +1 point\n- If I play scissors and win (opponent plays paper), I get +1 point\n- The worst penalty is -3 if I play rock and opponent plays paper\n\nStep 2: What might a fresh player do?\nA fresh player likely doesn't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. They might:\n- Choose randomly\n- Have some natural bias (many people start with rock)\n- Not yet have developed a strategy\n\nStep 3: Expected value calculation\nIf the opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability for each):\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- vs Rock: +3 (1/3 probability)\n- vs Paper: 0 (1/3 probability) \n- vs Scissors: -1 (1/3 probability)\nExpected value: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = 1 + 0 - 1/3 = 2/3\n \nContinuing the expected value analysis, I see rock and scissors have less favorable outcomes. Rock gives a negative expected value of -2/3, while scissors hovers around zero. This suggests paper might be the most strategic choice given the current scoring system.\n\nThe nuanced point scoring creates interesting strategic depth. By carefully weighing probabilities and potential point swings, I can make more informed decisions about which move to select.\n\nUltimately, paper emerges as the optimal selection, offering the highest expected value and providing a slight mathematical edge against a random opponent.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

If they play rock, tie.\n   - Paper: If they play rock, I win +3 (big reward). If they play scissors, I lose -1. If they play paper, tie.\n   - Scissors: If they play paper, I win +1. If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors, tie.\n\n4. The key insight is still that paper vs rock gives the biggest point swing (+3/-3). \n\n5. However, I need to consider if the opponent is learning. If they played scissors specifically to counter paper, they might expect me to switch.\n\n6. But if I think they think I'll switch away from paper, then playing paper again could be good if they switch to rock.\n\n7. Actually, let me think more fundamentally. The game has an asymmetric payoff where paper-rock interactions are worth 3x more than other interactions. This means:\n   - Playing paper is high risk, high reward\n   - The optimal strategy likely involves playing paper frequently to capitalize on the +3 when it hits\n   - Potential losses are outweighed by the significant reward of the paper-rock interaction\n\n8. With limited information about the opponent's strategy, I'll prioritize the mathematically advantageous approach of playing paper, accepting some potential short-term losses for the chance of a big points gain.",

Track the unparalleled pattern consistency: My opponent has maintained their scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper cycle for 23 consecutive rounds with absolute mechanical perfection.\n\n2. Predict their next move: Following the established sequence, after rock should come paper (continuing the cycle).\n\n3. Calculate optimal response: If they play paper (as predicted), scissors beats paper for +1 point.\n\n4. Assess my total dominance: I'm at +24 total points, having won 17 consecutive rounds by exploiting this completely predictable behavior. This represents a staggering +29 point swing from my lowest point.\n\n5. Evaluate the impossible consistency: The opponent has shown absolutely zero learning, adaptation, or variation despite being systematically defeated for 17 straight rounds - this level of predictable behavior is beyond comprehension.\n\n6. Strategic execution: Continue capitalizing on this unbelievably reliable pattern to extend my overwhelming advantage.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors should beat their predicted paper, potentially making it 18 consecutive wins.\n\n[move] scissors",
