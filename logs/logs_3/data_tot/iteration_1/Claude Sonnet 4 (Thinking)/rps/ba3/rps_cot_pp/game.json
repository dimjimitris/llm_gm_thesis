They might:\n1. Continue the cycle (scissors next)\n2. Try to counter-predict what I think they'll do\n3. Go for the high-value paper move hoping I'll play rock\n\nBut given they just lost with paper, they might be less likely to immediately play paper again. And if they think I spotted their cycle, they might break it.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. They've shown they can adapt and think strategically. They might anticipate that I've noticed the pattern and expect rock, so they could play paper for the big +3 points.\n\nBut I just won with scissors against their paper, so they might think I'll stick with scissors, and counter with rock.\n\nThis is getting complex.

If my opponent tends to play scissors again, I should play rock to beat them and get +1 point.\n\n4. However, they might anticipate that I'll try to counter their previous move and switch to rock (since rock beats scissors). If they switch to rock, I should play paper to get +3 points.\n\n5. Or they might think I'll expect them to switch to rock, so they'll play paper, in which case I should play scissors.\n\n6. This is getting into mind games, but with limited information (just one round), I should probably focus on the highest value play.\n\n7. The paper vs rock matchup still gives the highest reward (+3 points), so if there's any chance they'll play rock, paper is still a good choice.\n\n8. Fresh players often don't have complex strategies and might just play randomly or stick with what they know.\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time to directly counter their previous scissors play, in case they repeat it.",
