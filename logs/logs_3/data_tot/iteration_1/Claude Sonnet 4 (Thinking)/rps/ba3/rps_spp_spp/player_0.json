    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Interesting! The opponent also played paper, which tells us they understand the asymmetric payoffs. This isn't a naive player - they're strategic. Now we have a second-level game. They know I know the scoring system. What would they expect me to do now? Since we both played paper, they might think:\n1. I'll stick with paper (strong move)\n2. I'll switch to scissors (expecting them to play paper again)\n3. I'll randomize my strategy\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The tie might create different psychological reactions. Some players double down on what they perceive as a \"good\" move and play paper again. Others might think \"they'll expect me to play paper again, so I should switch.\" There's also the psychology of wanting to \"win\" after a tie - they might go for scissors to beat my expected paper, or rock to try something different.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given that we're both strategic players now, what's the optimal counter-strategy? If they're likely to:\n1. Play paper again (thinking it's still strong) - I should play scissors (+1)\n2. Play scissors (expecting me to play paper again) - I should play rock (+1)  \n3. Play rock (trying something different) - I should play paper (+3)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is where game theory gets interesting. Since we both showed strategic thinking, they might be thinking one level deeper. But there's still value in paper because if they switch to rock (thinking I'll switch away from paper), I get the big +3 payoff. However, scissors might be the safer play - it beats paper (their previous choice) and only loses to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I lean toward scissors. After a tie, many players either repeat their move or expect their opponent to repeat. Playing scissors covers both scenarios well - beats paper repeat, and only loses to rock with minimal penalty.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - it's likely they'll repeat paper or expect me to repeat paper, and scissors handles both scenarios favorably.\n\n[move] (Switching to scissors to counter their likely paper repeat or my expected paper repeat) scissors"

In round 1, they recognized the high-value paper move. In round 2, they correctly predicted I'd switch to scissors (either to beat their expected paper repeat, or because I'd think they'd expect me to repeat paper). Playing rock to beat my scissors was clever - they're thinking 2-3 levels deep.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This opponent is sophisticated. They're not just reacting - they're anticipating my meta-strategy. Now they might expect me to think \"they played rock to counter my scissors, so they might expect me to play paper now for the big +3 payoff.\" But that could be exactly what they want me to think. They might play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's analyze their possible next moves:\n1. If they think I'll play paper (for +3 against expected rock repeat) - they'll play scissors\n2. If they think I'll play rock (to counter their rock) - they'll play paper  \n3. If they think I'll play scissors (to counter expected paper) - they'll play rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is getting into infinite recursion territory. But let's consider: they've been successful with their counter-predictions so far. They might expect me to go for the high-value paper play now, thinking I'll assume they'll repeat rock. If so, scissors would be their counter. However, there's also the possibility they'll try to establish a pattern-breaking strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Given their success, they might be feeling confident in their read of my strategy. The temptation for me to play paper (for that +3 against rock) is obvious, and they likely see that. I think they'll anticipate paper and play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock - they're likely expecting me to go for the high-value paper play and will counter with scissors.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to anticipate my paper play and counter with scissors, so playing rock to beat their expected scissors) rock"

That's the complete cycle! They might be following a systematic approach, which means paper could be next. But they also know I successfully counter-predicted them last round, so they might break the pattern. The question is: are they thinking I'll expect the pattern to continue?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is fascinating. They played exactly what we predicted - scissors expecting my paper. But I outplayed them with rock. Now they know I'm reading their strategy well. This could create psychological pressure. They might think: \"This player predicted my prediction, so they'll expect me to play paper next (completing the cycle). So I should play something else.\" The psychological effect of being outplayed might make them want to break their pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they stick to the pattern, paper is next - I should play scissors (+1). If they break the pattern expecting me to predict it, they might play:\n- Rock (thinking I'll play scissors to beat expected paper) - I should play paper (+3)  \n- Scissors (thinking I'll play rock to be contrarian) - I should play rock (+1)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's the key insight: they've been strategic but also somewhat predictable. The paper-rock-scissors sequence could be intentional or coincidental. If intentional, they might expect me to notice and either continue expecting paper (so I play scissors) or expect them to break it. The high-stakes move here is if they play rock and I play paper for +3.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After being successfully counter-predicted, many players either double down on their strategy or completely abandon it.

They completed the cycle and started over. This could indicate they're following a systematic rotation strategy, which would make scissors their next move. But the fact that we both played paper again suggests they're also thinking at a high level - they predicted I might go for the high-value paper play just like I predicted they might break their pattern with rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Two ties now suggests we're well-matched strategically. They've shown pattern-like behavior (paper-rock-scissors-paper) but the second paper suggests they're also thinking about my thinking. The psychological dynamic has shifted - we're both successfully reading each other at times. This creates an interesting tension: do they continue the apparent pattern (scissors next) or do they expect me to expect the pattern?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's analyze what they might be thinking:\n1. If they continue the pattern: scissors next - I should play rock (+1)\n2. If they think I'll expect scissors and play rock to beat it - they'll play paper - I should play scissors (+1)\n3. If they think I'll expect them to break the pattern and will play scissors to beat my expected paper - they'll play rock - I should play paper (+3)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's what I find most telling: they returned to paper after the complete cycle. This suggests they either have a longer pattern (paper-rock-scissors-paper-?-?) or they're being more sophisticated than simple cycling. However, the mathematical value of catching them with rock when they play scissors (+1) versus catching them with paper when they play rock (+3) makes paper attractive again.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: But we just both played paper! They might expect me to think \"we both just played paper, they won't expect me to play it again.\" This reverse psychology could work in my favor if they switch to rock and I stick with paper. However, if they're truly cycling, scissors is next, and rock beats scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock - if they're following the pattern, scissors is next, and rock gives me a clean +1.

That's clearly a repeating paper-rock-scissors cycle! If the pattern holds, scissors is definitely next. But here's the crucial insight: we just both played rock, which means they deviated from the pattern (should have been scissors) or they're thinking about my pattern recognition. The three ties out of five rounds suggest we're reading each other very well.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Three ties indicates we're synchronized in our strategic thinking. The fact that we both played rock suggests they expected me to expect scissors (from their pattern) and played rock to beat my expected paper counter. But I was thinking the same way! This level of meta-thinking suggests they're very sophisticated. Now they might think: \"We both played rock, they definitely see the pattern now, so they'll expect scissors and play rock.

They get the high-value +3 if I play rock expecting their scissors.

They've successfully counter-predicted me twice now - in round 2 (rock beat my scissors) and just now (rock beat my scissors again). They're operating at a very high strategic level, essentially predicting my predictions of their predictions. The pattern seemed to be paper-rock-scissors, but they've played rock twice in a row now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They're reading me like a book! I've been overthinking their moves, and they're capitalizing on my meta-level reasoning. When I expected them to break pattern with paper (thinking I'd expect scissors), they played rock knowing I'd switch to scissors to counter the paper. This suggests they understand my strategic thinking process very well. The psychological pressure is building - I'm down points and they're outmaneuvering me consistently.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I need to step back from the deep meta-thinking. Their recent success suggests they're anticipating my complex reasoning. Maybe I should simplify my approach. Their last two moves were rock, rock. Options:\n1. They continue with rock - I should play paper (+3)\n2. They return to pattern with scissors - I should play rock (+1)  \n3.

Even if they don't, the downside scenarios aren't catastrophic.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Sometimes the best counter to someone who's predicting your complexity is simplicity. They might expect me to continue overthinking. The most straightforward play - paper for the high-value payoff against their recent rock streak - might catch them off guard precisely because it's not overthought.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - take the direct approach and go for the high-value payoff against their recent rock pattern, avoiding overthinking that they've been exploiting.\n\n[move] (Going for the straightforward high-value play against their recent rock streak, avoiding the overthinking they've been exploiting) paper"

When I overthink, they beat me.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is remarkable synchronization. We both went for the obvious high-value paper play after I decided to stop overthinking. This suggests they were also thinking \"go for the straightforward play.\" The psychological dynamic has shifted - we're no longer in a complex prediction game, we're in a \"what's the most logical move\" game. After two paper ties, what would be most logical for both of us?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The fact that we keep tying suggests we're using similar decision-making processes. If they're thinking like me, they might be considering:\n1. \"We both played paper, they might expect me to switch to avoid another tie\"\n2. \"Paper has been successful (ties), but maybe I should try something else\"\n3. \"What would I do if I were them?\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Here's what I notice: our ties happened when we both made \"obvious\" moves - paper for high value, rock when we both expected scissors, paper again for high value. This suggests that when we both think straightforwardly, we align. The question is: what's the straightforward move after two consecutive paper ties?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After two paper ties, the straightforward thinking might be: \"We can't both keep playing paper forever. One of us needs to switch.\" If we're both thinking this way, the question becomes what to switch to. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper. If they think I'll switch from paper to rock (the \"safe\" move), they might play paper for +3. But if I think they'll think that...\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Wait - let's avoid the overthinking trap again! The simple logic after paper-paper ties: if they stick with paper, I need scissors (+1). If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I need paper (+3). If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock), I need rock (+1). The highest-value outcome is still paper beating rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - after two paper ties, a natural switch would be to counter the paper, and scissors is the direct counter.\n\n[move] (After two consecutive paper ties, making the direct counter to paper) scissors"

Their full sequence: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper. My total is now 0 points (was -1, now +1). Key insight: they played paper twice in a row, and I correctly predicted the second one with scissors. Now they know that I successfully read their paper repetition. What's their likely response to being beaten on a repeated move?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a crucial psychological moment. They just got punished for repeating paper, so they'll likely want to switch. But they also know I know they got punished for repeating. The natural reaction is either: 1) Switch away from paper entirely, or 2) Think I'll expect them to switch and deliberately stick with paper. Given they're sophisticated, they might lean toward switching.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they switch from paper, their options are:\n1. Rock - thinking I'll play scissors again (since it just worked) - but then I should play paper (+3)\n2. Scissors - thinking I'll expect rock and play paper - but then I should play rock (+1)\n\nIf they stick with paper thinking I'll expect them to switch, then I should play scissors again (+1).\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The highest value scenario is if they play rock and I play paper for +3. This could happen if they think I'll repeat my successful scissors play. Given their sophistication and the fact that they just got beaten by my scissors, rock seems like a reasonable counter-move for them. It's the direct counter to my successful scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. After being beaten, the natural tendency is to play the move that would have won the previous round. Rock beats scissors, so if they expect me to get confident and repeat scissors, they'll play rock. This makes paper a strong choice for me - it gives the maximum payoff against their likely rock counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - they'll likely counter my successful scissors with rock, giving me the high-value +3 payoff.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to counter my successful scissors with rock, so playing paper for the maximum payoff) paper"

This is highly unusual for such a sophisticated opponent. My total score is now 1 point. The key question: what does a strategic player do after playing the same move three consecutive times? They must know this looks predictable, so they're either: 1) Setting a trap by making me expect a switch, or 2) Actually going to switch because three in a row is too predictable even for them.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Three identical moves in a row creates massive psychological pressure to change. Even sophisticated players rarely want to play the same move four times consecutively - it feels too predictable and vulnerable. However, they might be thinking exactly that: \"They'll expect me to switch after three papers, so I'll continue with paper.\" But that level of reverse psychology might be overthinking even for them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Let's consider their most likely switches:\n1. To rock - expecting me to play scissors again (since I've won twice with scissors beating their paper) - I should play paper (+3)\n2. To scissors - thinking I'll expect rock and counter with paper - I should play rock (+1)  \n3. Stay with paper - thinking I'll expect them to switch - I should play scissors (+1)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The mathematical expectation strongly favors paper here. If they switch to rock (most natural after three papers and expecting my scissors), I get +3. If they stick with paper, I get +1 with scissors. If they go to scissors, I lose -1 with paper. But the +3 potential is worth the risk, especially since rock is a very reasonable play for them after three papers.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm convinced they'll switch. Three papers creates too much psychological discomfort to continue. And if they switch, rock is most likely - it counters my successful scissors strategy. This makes paper the optimal choice for maximum value.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper - after three consecutive papers, they'll likely switch to rock, giving me the maximum +3 payoff.\n\n[move] (After their three consecutive papers, expecting them to switch to rock and going for the maximum payoff) paper"

No sophisticated player does this without a very specific reason. My score remains at 0 points. Either this is the most elaborate psychological trap I've ever seen, or something has fundamentally changed in their strategy. Four identical moves is beyond any normal strategic consideration.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Four papers in a row is psychologically almost impossible for a strategic player to continue. The pressure to switch after four identical moves is overwhelming. But here's the twist - they MUST know I'm thinking this. They might be setting up the ultimate reverse psychology: \"They'll never expect me to play paper a fifth time.\" However, even sophisticated players have limits to how many times they'll repeat a move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is the critical decision point. Options:\n1. They switch to rock (expecting my scissors counter to their papers) - I should play paper (+3)\n2. They switch to scissors (thinking I'll expect rock and play paper) - I should play rock (+1)\n3. They incredibly play paper again (ultimate reverse psychology) - I should play scissors (+1)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Mathematically, this is clear-cut. After four papers, the probability of a switch is extremely high. If they switch to rock (most logical counter to expected scissors), I get +3 with paper. The risk of them playing paper a fifth time exists, but it's much lower than the probability of them switching to rock. The expected value strongly favors paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I'm 95% certain they switch. Four papers creates unbearable psychological pressure. And if they switch, rock is the most natural choice - it beats scissors, which is the obvious counter to their paper streak.

They're exploiting my expectation by never switching! This is brilliant counter-strategy. They're turning my \"logical\" thinking against me.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I think I understand now! They've psychologically trapped me.

They're counting on my disbelief that they'd continue this streak.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Wait... they've essentially trained me to play paper by making me expect switches that never come.

But it feels too obvious, which is exactly why it might work.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly! They've created a psychological paradox where the \"obvious\" move (scissors beats paper) feels wrong because I keep expecting them to be more sophisticated.

I've been out-thinking myself into their trap.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a masterclass in psychological manipulation.

This confirms they were deliberately exploiting my expectation of switches. Now they know their strategy has been exposed and countered. What's their likely response?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a pivotal psychological moment. Their six-paper strategy just got punished, so they'll almost certainly abandon it. After being beaten on such an extended pattern, the natural response is to switch strategies entirely. They might feel exposed and want to regain the initiative. The question is: do they counter my successful scissors directly, or do they expect me to expect that counter?\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: After breaking their pattern, they have several options:\n1.

The question is: do they continue reactive thinking or try to break out of it?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This opponent is in freefall. Three straight losses, 5-point deficit, and every prediction they've made has failed. The psychological state is likely desperation mixed with frustration. They're caught in a reactive loop - each loss prompts them to play the obvious counter to what beat them, which I then counter.

They probably realized they were in a reactive trap and deliberately chose the unexpected move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This is a crucial turning point. They just broke my three-win streak and likely feel psychological relief. Breaking the reactive pattern probably restored some confidence. The question now is: do they stick with rock (since it just worked), return to more sophisticated strategy, or expect me to counter their rock?

This is either a deliberate pattern or an emerging rhythm in their play.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They've regained confidence with two wins and seem to have found a new strategy. The rock-scissors alternation might be their way of staying unpredictable while having a simple system to follow. They're no longer reactive - they're proactive with a pattern.

They probably think \"I just proved I can outthink them, now I'll punish their paper with scissors.\" This makes rock a strong choice to counter their likely scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock - after successfully breaking the pattern and predicting my paper, they'll likely follow up with scissors to punish paper plays.\n\n[move] (After they successfully broke the pattern and predicted my paper, expecting them to follow with scissors to punish paper plays) rock"

They've abandoned the alternating pattern and are now playing more reactively again. After losing to my rock with scissors, they're back in a position where they need to respond. The direct counter to rock is paper, which fits their recent tendency toward reactive plays.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They just lost again after successfully breaking one pattern, which might be psychologically frustrating. They're switching between sophisticated pattern-making and reactive play. After my rock beat their scissors, the natural psychological response is to play paper - it's the direct counter that would have won the previous round. This reactive thinking has emerged several times when they're under pressure.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given their recent reactive tendencies, they're likely to:\n1. Play paper - direct counter to my rock - I should play scissors (+1)\n2. Play rock - thinking I'll expect paper and play scissors - I should play paper (+3)\n3. Play scissors - unexpected repeat despite it failing - I should play rock (+1)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The pattern suggests they're most likely to play paper as the direct counter to rock. They've shown this reactive tendency multiple times throughout the game. While they're capable of sophisticated moves, they often default to direct counters when they've just lost. Scissors gives me a solid +1 against their likely paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. After losing to rock, the immediate thought is \"paper beats rock.\" They've shown this reactive pattern before, especially after losses. Even sophisticated players fall into reactive thinking under pressure. The safe, logical play is scissors to counter their expected paper response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors - they're likely to react to my rock with paper as the direct counter, giving me another point.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to react to my rock with the direct counter paper) scissors"

Their recent sequence confirms the reactive pattern: rock, scissors, paper - they played paper as the direct counter to my rock, exactly as predicted.

This suggests scissors is next as the counter to my scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Two consecutive successful predictions of their reactive behavior! They're stuck in the reactive loop again - each loss prompts them to play the obvious counter to what beat them. After losing to scissors with paper, the natural reactive response is scissors (which beats scissors... wait, that's not right). Actually, the counter to scissors is rock, so they'd play rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Wait, let me think about this correctly:\n- My scissors just beat their paper\n- The direct counter to scissors is rock\n- Following their reactive pattern, they should play rock next\n- I should play paper to beat their rock (+3)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Exactly right! The reactive pattern is: they play the move that would have beaten my previous winning move. Since scissors beat their paper, they'll play rock (which beats scissors). This gives me the opportunity for the high-value paper play worth +3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The reactive psychology is clear: \"They beat me with scissors, I need rock to beat scissors next time.\" This is the same thinking that led them to play paper after losing to rock.

They might feel confident enough to play the direct follow-up, which would be scissors to beat paper. However, they also know I know they just outplayed me, so they might expect me to expect scissors. This is where the high-value paper play could work if they choose rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After successfully counter-predicting me, they're likely feeling confident and might play more aggressively.

Since my rock just beat their scissors, they're likely to react with paper (the direct counter to rock).\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They just got caught in their aggressive follow-up pattern - playing scissors after their successful paper tie. Now they've lost again and are likely back in reactive mode. The psychological cycle is clear: they get sophisticated, succeed, get overconfident with scissors, lose, then react with the direct counter.

Since my scissors just beat their paper, the reactive pattern predicts rock next (rock beats scissors).\n\n**Psychology Expert**: This reactive pattern is now completely predictable! They've done it consistently - lose to rock, play paper; lose to scissors, play rock. They're locked into this psychological loop where each loss triggers an immediate counter-response.

Their sequence: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper.
