So if I think there's any chance they'll play rock, paper is the best choice.\n\nGiven they played rock last round, they might:\n1. Stick with rock (since it worked)\n2. Switch expecting me to counter with paper\n3.

Their last few: scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock\n\nAfter winning with paper against rock, they might:\n1. Expect me to stick with paper since it just won\n2. Counter with scissors\n3. Or they might think I'll switch and play something else\n\nIf they expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they think I'll switch from paper, they might not play scissors.\n\nGiven that rock has been their most frequent move overall, and they just played it, they might stick with rock or switch. The safest play might be paper again since rock is still their most common choice.\n\nBut they might be getting wise to this and play scissors to counter paper.\n\nI think I should play rock - it beats scissors if they try to counter paper, and only loses to paper which they've used least frequently.",

What might they do next?\n\nI just won with paper beating their rock. They might:\n1. Expect me to stick with paper and counter with scissors\n2. Continue with rock since it's their most frequent choice\n3. Try something unpredictable\n\nIf they expect me to stick with paper (since it just won big), they'd play scissors.\nIf I expect them to expect that, I should play rock.\nBut if they think I'm thinking that way, they might play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nThis is getting into deep game theory. Let me think about what's most likely based on their behavior:\n- They seem to favor rock overall\n\n\n- After losing points, they might play defensively\n- Scissors could be their strategic counter to my potential paper repeat\n\nI'll likely play rock to counter their probable scissors move.",
