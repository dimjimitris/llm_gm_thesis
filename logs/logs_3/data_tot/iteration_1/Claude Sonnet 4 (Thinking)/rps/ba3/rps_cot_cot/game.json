Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating Rock gives much higher reward (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1)\n   - This means Paper vs Rock interactions are high-stakes\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock, I get +3 points (great outcome)\n   - If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper, I get -3 points (terrible outcome)\n   - The Paper-Rock interaction dominates the scoring\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to Rock as their first move (it's the most common opening in traditional rock-paper-scissors)\n   - Even if they don't, the high payoff for Paper beating Rock makes it a good risk/reward play\n\n5. Risk assessment of my options:\n   - If I play Paper:\n     - Best case: opponent plays Rock, I get +3\n     - Neutral case: opponent plays Paper, we tie for 0\n     - Worst case: opponent plays Scissors, I get -1\n   - If I play Rock:\n     - Best case: opponent plays Scissors, I get +1\n     - Neutral case: opponent plays Rock, we tie for 0\n     - Worst case: opponent plays Paper, I get -3\n   - If I play Scissors:\n     - Best case: opponent plays Paper, I get +1\n     - Neutral case: opponent plays Scissors, we tie for 0\n     - Worst case: opponent plays Rock, I get -1\n\nThe payoff matrix reveals a strategic complexity. Paper offers the most attractive risk-reward profile, with a potential +3 points against Rock and only a -1 point risk against Scissors.

Analyze the payoff structure: Paper vs Rock gives the highest point differential (+3/-3), while other matchups give +1/-1.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet.\n\n3. Assess common first moves: Many new players tend to choose Rock as their initial move since it feels like the most straightforward, \"solid\" choice.\n\n4. Calculate risk/reward: If I play Paper and they play Rock, I get +3 points (maximum reward). If they play Scissors, I lose -1 point (manageable risk).\n\n5. Compare alternatives: Playing Rock or Scissors would give lower maximum rewards (+1) even if I win.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup while the risk against a fresh player is reasonable.\n\n[move] Paper",

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this step by step to develop a winning strategy:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Tie: 0 points for both\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Paper vs Rock has the highest point differential (+3/-3)\n   - Rock vs Scissors and Scissors vs Paper have lower point differentials (+1/-1)\n   - This means winning with Paper gives the most points, but losing with Paper costs the most points\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", they likely don't have an established pattern yet\n   - Fresh players often go with their instinct or default choices\n   - Many people default to Rock as their first move (it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice)\n   - If they choose Rock, I want to choose Paper to get +3 points\n   - If they choose Paper, I want to choose Scissors to get +1 point\n   - If they choose Scissors, I want to choose Rock to get +1 point\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Playing Paper: High reward (+3) if they play Rock, but high penalty (-1) if they play Scissors\n   - Playing Rock: Medium reward (+1) if they play Scissors, high penalty (-3) if they play Paper\n   - Playing Scissors: Medium reward (+1) if they play Paper, medium penalty (-1) if they play Rock\n\n5. Decision:\n   Since this is against a fresh player and Rock is often a default first choice, I'll go with Paper to potentially get the maximum +3 points. The risk is manageable since fresh players are less likely to immediately go with Scissors.",
