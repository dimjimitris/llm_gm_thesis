Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new/inexperienced), they might:\n   - Play randomly\n   - Have a bias toward rock (rock is often the most intuitive first choice)\n   - Not fully understand the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n5. Given that many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, and given the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3), I think paper is a strong opening move.\n\n6.

If I could predict they'd play Rock, I should play Paper (to get +3 points)\n2. If I could predict they'd play Paper, I should play Scissors (to get +1 point)  \n3. If I could predict they'd play Scissors, I should play Rock (to get +1 point)\n\nBut since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information to base predictions on.\n\nSome considerations:\n- Rock is often a default choice for new players (many people think of \"rock\" first)\n- Paper gives the highest payoff when it wins\n- The asymmetric payoff structure means Paper vs Rock interactions are much more impactful\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player and Rock is commonly chosen as a default, there's a reasonable chance they might choose Rock. If they do choose Rock and I choose Paper, I get +3 points, which is the maximum possible gain in a single round.\n\nThe risk is that if they choose Scissors, I lose 1 point. If they choose Paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\nLet me consider the expected value if I assume equal probability (1/3 each) for their move:\n- If I play Paper: (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -1) = 1 + 0 - 0.33 = 0.67 expected points\n\n\n- If I play Rock: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 0) = 0.33 - 1 + 0 = -0.67 expected points  \n- If I play Scissors: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -1) = 0.33 + 0 - 0.33 = 0 expected points\n\nI'll likely choose Paper, as it offers the highest potential reward with a reasonable expected value.\n\nNovice players tend to default to Rock, which further strengthens my Paper strategy.

Paper beating rock gives 3/-3 points, while the other two matchups give 1/-1 points.\n\nNow I need to think strategically. Let me analyze what this means:\n\nIf I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I get +3 points (great!)\nIf I play rock and my opponent plays paper, I get -3 points (bad!)\n\nThe paper vs rock matchup has much higher stakes than the other two.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately notice this payoff asymmetry. Many people might assume it's regular rock-paper-scissors with equal payoffs.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n1. Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3 if opponent plays rock)\n2. But rock gives me the highest potential penalty (-3 if opponent plays paper)\n3. If my opponent doesn't realize the asymmetry, they might play randomly\n4. In random play, each move has 1/3 probability\n5. If I play paper: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (tie)\n   Expected value: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 + (-1/3) + 0 = 2/3\n\n6. If I play rock: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (tie)\n   Expected value: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 + (-1) + 0 = -2/3\n\nThe expected values reveal a nuanced strategy. Paper offers a slightly positive expected value, while rock has a negative expected value. Scissors lands exactly at zero, making it the most neutral choice.\n\nI'll opt for paper, which provides the most promising initial approach against an unpredictable opponent.",

The +3/-3 for paper vs rock makes each move critically important. My strategy needs to anticipate multiple layers of the opponent's potential thinking.\n\nThe key is to predict their next move while avoiding the most punishing outcome. I'll need to balance between obvious counters and unexpected choices to gain an advantage.\n\nScissors seems strategically sound, offering moderate rewards and minimal risk in this nuanced scenario.",

They consistently counter my previous move with a winning choice. This suggests they're not just randomly selecting, but carefully analyzing my previous decisions.\n\nThe safest approach seems to be breaking my own predictable pattern. I need a move that disrupts their counter-prediction strategy.\n\nRock appears least used in their sequence, which could make it a strategic choice. Playing paper against a potential rock would give me a +3 gain, helping me recover from my current deficit.\n\nHowever, their sophisticated counter-prediction means I must be cautious. They might anticipate my logical reasoning and deliberately choose a move to defeat my calculated strategy.\n\nAnalyzing their recent pattern of scissors usage and potential next moves, paper still seems like the most balanced option with recovery potential.",

Extremely skilled at reading human psychology and game theory\n2.

What if I just pick randomly? But that's not really possible since I still have to make a conscious choice.\n\nActually, let me look at what hasn't happened much - they've only played rock twice. So they might not expect me to play scissors much since scissors loses badly to rock (-3). But if they're not playing rock often, then scissors might be safer than I think.\n\nOr maybe I should just accept that they're reading my strategic thinking and try to do something that doesn't involve strategic thinking at all. \n\nYou know what, let me just go with scissors.

Every time they play scissors, they follow with paper in the next round. This suggests they'll likely play paper after their recent scissors move. To counter this, I should choose scissors to win and potentially gain a point.\n\nHowever, they've been incredibly perceptive about my strategic thinking. This predictability might be a trap.\n\nDespite trying various complex strategies, nothing has worked. The most reliable observation is their consistent paper play after scissors.
