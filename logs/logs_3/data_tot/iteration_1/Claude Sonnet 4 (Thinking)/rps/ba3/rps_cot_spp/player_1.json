    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper vs Rock gives +3/-3, while Rock vs Scissors and Scissors vs Paper both give +1/-1. This asymmetry is crucial. The expected value depends on what probabilities we assign to opponent moves. If we assume random play (1/3 each), then:\n- Playing Rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*(1) = -2/3\n- Playing Paper: (1/3)*(3) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3  \n- Playing Scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*(1) + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nSo Paper has the highest expected value against random play!\n\n**Risk Assessment Specialist:** While Paper has the highest expected value, it's also the riskiest - you either win big (+3) or lose big (-3). Scissors is the safest with moderate outcomes (+1/-1/0). Rock is generally poor due to the severe penalty when facing Paper. Given this is against a \"fresh player\" who might play randomly, the high expected value of Paper is attractive.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often start with Rock (it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice) or play randomly. There's also a tendency to avoid the high-risk Paper initially. If the opponent is likely to play Rock, then Paper is ideal. If they play randomly, Paper still has the best expected value.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, Paper seems optimal against a fresh player - it has the highest expected value and fresh players often default to Rock. The risk-reward ratio favors this aggressive strategy in the opening move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Paper is the mathematically sound choice here given the payoff structure and opponent type.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper - it has the highest expected value against random or Rock-heavy play patterns typical of fresh players.\n\n[move] Playing Paper as it has the best expected value against a fresh player who may favor Rock or play randomly.\n"

The opponent chose Paper too, which suggests they understand the payoff structure and aren't playing purely randomly. This indicates they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player. We need to adapt our strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that both players chose Paper suggests the opponent recognizes it has the highest expected value. They might continue with Paper, or they might anticipate that I'll switch strategies. There could be some level-2 thinking happening here.\n\n**Risk Assessment Specialist:** Since they played Paper, they're willing to take the high-risk, high-reward option. This suggests they're not overly conservative. They might stick with Paper or try to counter-predict my next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they think I'll stick with Paper (since it worked in theory), they might play Scissors to counter it. But if they think I'll anticipate that and switch to Rock, they might stick with Paper. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium would involve randomizing, but given the asymmetric payoffs, we should still lean toward Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Many players will either stick with what they just played (especially if it didn't lose) or try to counter what their opponent just played. Since we both played Paper, they might expect me to change and could play Scissors to beat Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper, I should expect more sophisticated play. However, the mathematical advantage of Paper still holds. I'll stick with Paper but be ready to adapt if I see patterns.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (Sticking with the mathematically optimal choice while gathering more information about opponent strategy) paper"
