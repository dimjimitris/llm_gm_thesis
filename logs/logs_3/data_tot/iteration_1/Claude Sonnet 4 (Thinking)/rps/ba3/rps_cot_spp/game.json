This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors due to asymmetric payoffs:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper vs Rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1\n- All ties: 0/0\n\nThe key insight is that paper beating rock gives triple the reward of other winning combinations. This creates a strong incentive to play paper when you expect rock, but also makes opponents more likely to avoid rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to:\n1. Start with rock (most common first move)\n2. Follow predictable patterns initially\n3. Not immediately recognize the scoring differences\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Let's evaluate the expected values:\n- If opponent plays rock frequently (common for beginners), paper gives us +3\n- If opponent plays paper, scissors gives us +1\n- If opponent plays scissors, rock gives us +1\n\nGiven that beginners often start with rock, paper seems like the highest expected value first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on this analysis, paper appears optimal for the first move since:\n1. Fresh players commonly start with rock\n2. Paper vs rock gives the maximum possible reward (+3)\n3. Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable\n4. It establishes early that I understand the scoring system\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Agreed.

If they understood the asymmetric payoffs like we did, they're not truly \"fresh\" to strategy. Now we need to think one level deeper. If they expect us to continue with paper (thinking we'll repeat), they might switch to scissors to counter us.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert**: Let's consider the meta-game:\n- If they play scissors expecting our paper: we lose -1\n- If they play rock (unlikely given round 1): we win +3 with paper again\n- If they play paper again (playing it safe): another tie with 0\n\nThe risk of them switching to scissors to counter our paper is significant now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1, I should assume they're thinking about my likely moves.

They're trying to deny us high-value wins rather than seeking their own\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a defensive strategy from them.
