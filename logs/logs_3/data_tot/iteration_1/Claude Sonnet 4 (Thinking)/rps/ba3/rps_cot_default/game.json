Consider fresh player psychology: New players often gravitate toward Rock because it feels strong and straightforward.\n\n3.

Analyze the payoff matrix: Paper beating Rock gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while Rock vs Scissors and Scissors vs Paper only give +1/-1 points.\n\n2. Consider fresh player psychology: New players often gravitate toward Rock because it feels strong and straightforward.\n\n3. Calculate risk vs reward: Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) and if many beginners choose Rock, Paper would be an effective counter.\n\n4. Against a random opponent, Paper has the best expected value due to its high payoff when winning against Rock.\n\n5.

The key insight is that Paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when Rock wins against it. \n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I need to think about what they might choose. Fresh players often don't have a sophisticated strategy, so they might:\n\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Choose something that \"feels\" strong (like Rock)\n3. Choose something simple\n\nIf the opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability each):\n- My expected value for Rock: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1 - 0 = -2/3\n- My expected value for Paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1 - 1/3 + 0 = 2/3\n- My expected value for Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1/3 + 0 = 0\n \nPaper emerges as the optimal choice. Beginners often gravitate towards Rock, making Paper an even more strategic selection. The potential for a high-reward (+3) win against Rock, combined with the best expected value, makes Paper the most promising move in this scenario.",

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the opponent's behavior. They've been very adaptive throughout the game, consistently trying to anticipate my moves and counter them. \n\nWe just tied with both playing Rock. The opponent has shown a pattern of:\n1. Adapting to counter my successful moves\n2. Anticipating what I'll do next based on recent patterns\n3. Staying one step ahead psychologically\n\nAfter a Rock tie, the most obvious move for me would be Paper to beat their Rock. But they've consistently shown they anticipate my obvious moves. If they expect me to play Paper, they would play Scissors to counter it.\n\nSo if I think they'll play Scissors (expecting my Paper), I should play Rock to beat their Scissors.\n\nBut wait - this is getting into multiple levels of thinking. Let me step back and look at their recent actual moves to see if there's a simpler pattern:\n\nRecent sequence: Scissors -> Scissors -> Scissors -> Rock -> Rock\n\nThey played Scissors 3 times, then Rock twice. This could suggest they're going back to their pattern of repeating moves multiple times.\n\nIf they continue with Rock, I should play Paper (+3 points).\nIf they switch to anticipate my counter, they might play Scissors (expecting my Paper), so I'd want Rock.\n\nGiven their adaptive nature, I think they're more likely to anticipate my Paper counter to their Rock and play Scissors. So Rock seems like the better choice.",
