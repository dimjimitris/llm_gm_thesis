You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Round 17: scissors (I won with rock, +1)\n18. Round 18: scissors (I won with rock, +1)\n19. Round 19: paper (I won with scissors, +1)\n20. Round 20: paper (I won with scissors, +1)\n21. Round 21: rock (I lost with scissors, -1)\n22. Round 22: rock (I won with paper, +3)\n23. Round 23: rock (I won with paper, +3)\n24. Round 24: scissors (I lost with paper, -1)\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n- Round 1: rock (1 time)\n\n\n- Rounds 2-5: scissors persist for multiple rounds, showing a consistent strategy of repeating moves before switching.\n- Rounds 6-9: paper emerges as the next repeated move, maintaining the pattern of 4-round sequences.\n- Rounds 10-14: rock dominates for 5 rounds, further establishing a predictable rhythm.\n- Round 15 marks a transition to scissors, breaking the previous rock sequence.\n- Rounds 16-18 continue the scissors strategy, suggesting a potential preference for this move.\n- Rounds 19-20 briefly return to paper before another quick change.\n- Round 21 switches to rock, indicating a short paper phase.\n- Rounds 22-23 solidify the rock move.\n- Round 24 abruptly shifts to scissors, potentially signaling another strategic change.\n\nThe opponent's play reveals a cyclical approach of repeating moves 3-5 times before switching, making rock a strategic counter to the current scissors move.",

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the pattern so far:\n\nThe opponent has been playing in streaks:\n1. Rock (round 1)\n2. Scissors (rounds 2-5) - 4 times\n3. Paper (rounds 6-9) - 4 times  \n4. Rock (rounds 10-13) - 4 times\n5. Scissors (rounds 14-17) - 4 times\n6. Paper (rounds 18-19) - then switched to rock on round 20\n7. Rock (rounds 20-23) - 4 times, then switched to scissors on round 24\n\nWait, let me recount more carefully:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)  \nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors - tie (0)\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper - I lost (-3)\nRound 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I lost (-1)\nRound 12: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1)\nRound 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\n\n\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\nRound 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I lost (-1)\nRound 24: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\nRound 25: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won (+3)\n\nI'm noticing a consistent pattern of alternating moves and scoring. The opponent seems to have predictable sequences, switching between rock, scissors, and paper in 4-round cycles. My strategy of adapting to these patterns has been mostly successful, with occasional losses when the opponent changes unexpectedly.\n\nI notice a cyclical pattern emerging with slight variations. The opponent seems to rotate through rock, scissors, and paper in somewhat predictable sequences. Each sequence appears to last around 4-5 rounds before shifting. The pattern isn't perfectly rigid, but there's a discernible rhythm of rock, scissors, paper repeating with minor deviations.\n\nThe sequence suggests a strategic approach might involve anticipating the next move based on these observed transitions. Tracking the frequency and order could provide an advantage in predicting future plays.",
