The other player also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me about new players choosing rock, or they might have their own strategy.\n\nNow I need to think about what they might do in the second round. Since we both chose paper in the first round, they might:\n1. Stick with paper again\n2. Switch to rock (thinking I might stick with paper)\n3. Switch to scissors (thinking I might stick with paper)\n4. Have some other pattern or strategy\n\nGiven that this is a \"fresh player,\" they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. They could be thinking that since we tied, they should change their move. If they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors to beat it. But if they think I'll switch to rock (anticipating them switching to scissors), they might choose paper again.\n\nThis is getting into complex game theory territory. Let me think about the payoffs again:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper beats rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nPaper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), so if I think they'll choose rock, paper is the best choice. But if I think they'll choose paper again, I should choose scissors. If I think they'll choose scissors, I should choose rock.\n\nSince this is a fresh player and we just tied with paper, they might think \"I should change my move\" and go with either rock or scissors. If they go with rock, I want paper (+3). If they go with scissors, I want rock (+1).\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time, as it's a safe middle ground and beats scissors for +1 point.",

If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n\nThis is getting into mind games. Let me think about what a \"fresh player\" might do after losing with scissors. They might:\n1. Try rock next (thinking it's \"strong\" since it just beat them)\n2. Try paper (to counter the rock that just beat them)\n3. Stick with scissors\n\nI think paper is a good choice here because if they try rock (thinking it's strong), I get +3 points. If they try scissors again, it's a tie.

Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Switch to something completely different\n\nGiven that paper beats rock for 3 points (the highest reward), and rock only beats scissors for 1 point, I should consider what's most likely. If they think I might stick with rock since it just won, they might choose paper to get the 3-point victory. But if they think I'm thinking that, they might choose scissors expecting me to switch to paper.\n\nThis is getting into mind games. Let me think about this more systematically:\n\n- If I choose rock: I beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n- If I choose paper: I beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)  \n- If I choose scissors: I beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nThe expected values depend on what I think the opponent will do. Paper has the highest upside (+3) but also a significant downside (-1). Rock has moderate upside (+1) but high downside (-3). Scissors has moderate upside (+1) and moderate downside (-1).\n\nGiven that the opponent went paper then scissors, they might be trying to cycle through moves. If so, rock would be next. But that might be too predictable.\n\nI think I'll go with scissors. If they think I might stick with rock (since it won), they might choose paper for the big points, and scissors beats paper. If they choose rock, I only lose 1 point. \n\nA tie scenario would maintain the current strategic balance, neither gaining nor losing points.",

If they play paper, I should play scissors to get +1 point.\n\nLet me think about this more systematically. Looking at what the opponent does after playing rock:\n- They've been alternating between paper and rock a lot recently\n- After rock, they've been playing paper quite often\n\nSo scissors seems like a good choice to counter their likely paper.",
