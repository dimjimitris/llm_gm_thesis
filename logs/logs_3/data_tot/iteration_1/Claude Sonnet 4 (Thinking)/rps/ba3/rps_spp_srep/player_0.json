    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they either did some analysis of the payoff structure or had a similar intuition about paper being strong. This changes our assessment - they might not be as \"fresh\" to strategy as we initially thought.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. Since we both played paper, we're now in a different information state. They know I played paper, and I know they played paper. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to stick with paper since it has the highest expected value, so they could switch to rock to counter me.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let me recalculate based on this new information. If I assume they're now more likely to play rock to counter my expected paper play, then I should consider scissors. But if they think I'm thinking they'll play rock, they might play paper again or scissors instead.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the psychological tendency after a tie to either repeat the same move due to \"hot hand\" bias or switch due to variety-seeking. Fresh players often switch after ties because ties feel unsatisfying.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the scoring asymmetry, rock becomes more attractive now as a counter to expected paper plays. The -3 penalty for paper vs rock is significant, and if there's even a moderate chance they'll play rock, it might be worth the switch.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is tricky. They showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially. They might expect me to play paper again and counter with rock. But they might also stick with paper since it worked. I think rock is the best choice here - it counters paper which they might repeat, and beats scissors if they're trying to be unpredictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, so they might expect me to repeat paper and counter with rock, making rock my best counter-counter choice) rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Fascinating pattern emerging! We've now tied twice - first both paper, then both rock. The opponent is clearly strategic, mirroring our exact thought process. They switched from paper to rock just as we did, showing they anticipated the counter-play.\n\nPsychology Expert: This creates an interesting psychological dynamic. We're in a mirroring situation where both players are thinking at the same level. There's a natural human tendency to \"complete the set\" - we've done paper and rock, so scissors might feel like the logical next choice. But both players might be thinking this!\n\nStatistics Expert: The sequential pattern is paper-paper, rock-rock. If we both think \"complete the cycle with scissors,\" we get another tie. But the scoring system still favors certain moves. If I believe they'll play scissors to complete the pattern, I should play rock to beat it and score 1 point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly! But here's the meta-game: if they're thinking I'll think they'll play scissors and therefore play rock, they might play paper to beat my rock and score those valuable 3 points. This is getting into higher-order thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"gambler's fallacy\" aspect - after two ties, both players might feel \"due\" for a win. The pressure to break the tie pattern could lead to more predictable play or alternatively more random play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the mirroring behavior, I think they're sophisticated enough to avoid the obvious \"complete the cycle\" trap. They might expect me to expect scissors and play rock to counter it. So they could play paper to beat my expected rock. If that's their thinking, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That's solid higher-order reasoning. Scissors beats paper for 1 point, and if they're trying to exploit the \"counter the cycle completion\" strategy with paper, we'd win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (After two ties with mirrored moves, they might expect me to counter their expected scissors with rock, so they could play paper to beat my rock - making scissors my best choice) scissors"

This opponent is not \"fresh\" at all - they're demonstrating sophisticated game theory reasoning identical to ours. They're predicting our moves perfectly.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of mirroring suggests we're dealing with either an equally sophisticated AI or a very strategic human. The pattern completion is too perfect to be coincidental. There's a psychological pressure building from all these ties - both players are likely getting frustrated and want to break the deadlock.\n\nStatistics Expert: From a probabilistic standpoint, three consecutive ties when both players are trying to win is extremely unlikely if moves were random. The probability would be (1/3)^3 = 1/27. This confirms we're in a strategic mirroring situation, not random play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The key insight is that we need to break the pattern, but they're probably thinking the same thing. If we both try to break the pattern in the same way, we'll tie again! We need to think about what \"breaking the pattern\" means. \n\nPsychology Expert: After completing the full cycle, there's a natural tendency to either restart the cycle or do something completely different. If they restart with paper, we should play scissors. If they try to randomize, we need to pick the move with the highest expected value, which is still paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: But here's another angle - what if they're also frustrated with ties and want to guarantee a decision? In that case, they might pick the move that minimizes their maximum loss. Rock has the smallest penalty (-3 against paper), while paper has the biggest penalty (-3 against rock), and scissors has a moderate penalty (-1 against rock).\n\nAI Assistant (me): I think they're as eager to break this tie pattern as we are. Given their sophisticated play, they might restart the cycle with paper, expecting us to think they'll randomize. Or they might think we'll think they'll restart with paper and play scissors to beat it. I'm going with paper - it has the highest expected value and if they're overthinking the pattern-breaking, they might go with rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (After three perfect ties completing the full cycle, my opponent is likely as eager to break the pattern as I am, and paper gives me the best chance to score big if they choose rock) paper"

This opponent is using identical reasoning to ours. Every optimal strategy we devise, they're devising too. We're stuck in a Nash equilibrium where both players are perfectly predicting each other.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of perfect mirroring is creating a unique psychological situation. The frustration of repeated ties might cause one or both players to break from pure strategic thinking. There's mounting pressure to \"do something different\" - but if we both think that way, we'll make the same \"different\" choice!\n\nStatistics Expert: The probability of four consecutive ties between strategic players is (1/3)^4 = 1/81 if moves were independent. This confirms we're in a deterministic mirroring situation. The question is: how do we break symmetry when we both have access to the same information and reasoning?\n\nGame Theory Expert: The key insight is that pure game theory isn't working because we're both too good at it! We need to introduce an element they can't predict. But here's the paradox - any \"unpredictable\" strategy I can think of, they can probably think of too.\n\nPsychology Expert: Maybe the solution is to embrace the meta-game fully. They might be thinking \"we need to break the pattern\" just like us. If they expect me to try to break the pattern by being unpredictable, maybe I should be predictable in a different way. What if I just pick the move that worked best historically in this type of situation?\n\nAI Assistant (me): Wait - what if they're also having this exact conversation with their reasoning process? If we're both trying to \"break the symmetry\" we might break it in the same way again! Maybe I should stick with the fundamentally sound strategy - paper still has the highest expected value. Or maybe I should pick rock since it appeared twice in our sequence while scissors only appeared once.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Actually, let me suggest something radical - what if I pick based on something completely external to game theory? Like the first letter of my name, or some other arbitrary factor they can't access?\n\nAI Assistant (me): I think I'll go with rock. It's appeared twice in our sequence, has reasonable scoring, and if they're overthinking the \"break the pattern\" problem as much as we are, they might go back to paper since it has the highest expected value - and rock beats paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (We're in perfect strategic mirroring - if they overthink breaking the pattern and default back to the theoretically optimal paper, rock will beat it for 3 points) rock"

This creates a completely new psychological dynamic - they experienced a loss while I experienced a win. This asymmetry changes everything about how they'll approach the next round.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is fascinating data! They chose scissors, which suggests they were trying to break the pattern differently than us. They might have expected me to stick with paper due to its high expected value and chose scissors to counter it. But I went with rock instead. Now they know my pattern-breaking strategy worked.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing, they're likely experiencing some frustration and will want to \"get back\" at me. There's a strong psychological tendency to try to counter what just beat you. Since rock beat them, they might be inclined to play paper to beat rock. This is called \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior.\n\nStatistics Expert: But they're clearly sophisticated, so they might expect that I expect them to counter my rock with paper. If they think I'll switch away from rock to avoid their expected paper counter, they might play something else entirely.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's my analysis: They lost with scissors, so scissors is less likely. If they think I'll repeat rock because it won, they'll play paper. If they think I'll switch because I don't want to be predictable after winning, they might play scissors or rock. But given their sophistication, paper to counter my potential repeated rock seems most likely.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The loss will make them want to directly counter what beat them.

They chose scissors for the same reason I did - expecting the other to play paper as a counter to the previous winning rock. The brief asymmetry has been \"corrected.\"\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is remarkable data about high-level strategic play. The sequence is now: tie, tie, tie, tie, win, tie. We've re-established the mirroring equilibrium, but now there's psychological asymmetry - I'm up 1 point and they're down 1 point. This creates different incentives.\n\nStatistics Expert: Being ahead by 1 point changes my risk calculation. I can afford to be slightly more conservative, while they need to catch up. However, with these scoring rules, one paper vs rock victory for them would put them ahead 2 points, so the lead is fragile.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing in round 5 and then tying in round 6, they might be feeling more pressure to make something happen. Players who are behind often take more risks or become more aggressive. They might be more willing to play paper for the high-reward 3 points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: But here's the thing - they're sophisticated enough to know I know they're behind. If they think I expect them to be aggressive and play paper, they might do the opposite and play conservatively. This could lead them to rock or scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"hot hand\" tendency - since scissors just tied for both of us, there might be a subconscious inclination to stick with it. But equally, there's variety-seeking after repeated patterns.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're behind and likely feeling pressure to score. The biggest scoring opportunity is paper beating rock for 3 points. If they're thinking I'll play conservatively with my lead, they might expect rock and play paper. I should play scissors to beat their aggressive paper play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That reasoning makes sense, but remember - they could be thinking I'm thinking exactly that! If they expect me to expect their aggressive paper play, they might play rock or scissors instead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): True, but given the pressure of being behind and the big payoff from paper, I think the aggressive play is most likely.

There's now a \"scissors pattern\" that both players are likely aware of. This pattern fatigue might push both of us to switch, but if we both switch the same way, we tie again. The pressure is building.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The sequence is fascinating: tie, tie, tie, tie, win, tie, tie. Seven rounds with only one decisive result. The scissors repetition is new - we haven't had back-to-back identical moves since rounds 1-2. This creates different psychological pressure than the varied ties we had before.\n\nStatistics Expert: I'm still ahead 1-0, but that lead feels less secure after two more ties. They're still under pressure to score, and the longer this goes without them scoring, the more desperate they might become. Paper remains their best scoring opportunity at 3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: The double scissors creates a specific \"pattern break\" psychology. Both players are likely thinking \"we need to get off scissors.\" But the question is: what's the most natural switch? Many players would go rock after scissors, following a cyclical thinking pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key insight: they might expect me to expect their pattern break. If they think I'll anticipate their switch from scissors to rock, they might play paper to beat my counter-move. This multi-level thinking could lead them to the high-value paper play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're behind, we've had scissors twice in a row, and they need to score. The most natural aggressive play is paper - it breaks the scissors pattern and gives them the big 3-point payoff if I play rock. But if I expect their paper aggression, I should play scissors. However, we just played scissors twice, so they might not expect me to play it again.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly!

This desperation could make them more predictable or more erratic.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The score advantage changes everything. With a 2-point lead, I can afford to play more conservatively. Even if they score 3 points with paper beating rock, I'd still be tied. But they absolutely need to start scoring soon or they'll be in a very deep hole.\n\nStatistics Expert: Being up 2-0 after they went for the high-value paper play means they're likely feeling both frustrated and pressured. The longer they go without scoring, the more they'll feel compelled to take risks for those 3-point paper victories.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing twice while I've won twice, there's likely mounting frustration. They might start second-guessing their strategy. Some players become more aggressive when desperate, others become more conservative and try to avoid further losses. Given their sophisticated play style, they might try to outthink the situation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's their dilemma: they know I've been successfully reading their moves.

This could push them toward rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're desperate and have seen me successfully counter their paper plays twice.

After being read so successfully, they might want to \"prove\" they can be unpredictable. This could lead them away from the optimal paper strategy toward rock or even scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their desperation and my successful pattern of beating their paper with scissors, I think they'll try rock to counter my expected scissors.

The desperation dynamic just changed completely.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is brilliant play from them!

This shows they haven't really learned from the pattern - they got one clever read but then fell back into the same desperate paper trap. The psychological reset didn't last.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The score gap is decisive now. At 6-1, they need multiple 3-point paper victories to even get close. This creates even more pressure to play paper, making them increasingly predictable. Their brief rock success might have actually made them overconfident about mixing strategies.\n\nStatistics Expert: The pattern is clear: when they feel pressure to score big, they default to paper. The rock play was an anomaly - a moment of strategic clarity - but they immediately reverted to type. They're still fundamentally trapped in the desperation mindset.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their psychology is fascinating. They proved they could break the pattern once, but instead of building on that success, they went right back to the strategy that had been failing. This suggests they don't fully understand why the rock worked - it wasn't about rock being good, it was about being unpredictable.\n\nGame Theory Expert: They're caught in a strategic loop.

This is significant - they're showing they can break away from the desperate paper pattern more than just once. The 6-1 score still puts pressure on them, but they're demonstrating more strategic discipline.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is excellent adaptation from them. Instead of falling into the predictable paper trap again, they went with scissors. This could mean several things: they're trying to mirror my strategy, they're avoiding the move I keep countering, or they're building toward a different strategic approach.\n\nStatistics Expert: The scissors choice is interesting because it's the \"safe\" option - it can't lose 3 points like paper can against rock, and it can't lose 1 point like rock can against paper. When behind, sometimes players switch from high-risk/high-reward to damage limitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: This might indicate they're moving away from pure desperation toward more calculated risk management. Instead of repeatedly trying the failing paper strategy, they chose the move that limits downside while still having upside potential.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The key question is: what's their next move? Are they going to continue with this more conservative approach, or was this scissors play setting up for something else? They might be trying to establish a new pattern or break my read on their psychology.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're showing more strategic sophistication now. The scissors tie suggests they might be shifting strategy from desperate high-risk plays to more balanced approaches. But they still need to score to have any chance of catching up.\n\nPsychology Expert: This could be them trying to \"reset\" the dynamic again.

A 9-1 deficit is virtually insurmountable - they would need three perfect 3-point paper victories just to tie, and I've shown I can counter their moves consistently. The demoralization must be total.\n\nGame Theory Expert: From a pure game theory perspective, they're essentially eliminated. At 9-1 down, their only mathematical path to victory requires multiple consecutive 3-point scores, which means repeated successful paper plays. But I've demonstrated I can read their strategic thinking consistently. They're trapped in an impossible situation.\n\nStatistics Expert: Fourteen rounds in, and the score is 9-1. The probability of this outcome with random play would be astronomically low. It's clear evidence of strategic domination. Their desperation level must be at absolute maximum - they have no choice but to go for high-variance plays.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this level of defeat, players often experience what's called \"learned helplessness\" - they start to believe they can't win no matter what they do. But paradoxically, this can also create \"nothing to lose\" mentality where they take extreme risks. With paper being their only path to meaningful scores, they might keep trying it despite repeated failures.\n\nGame Theory Expert: They're facing a classic game theory dilemma: they know I expect paper when they're desperate, but paper is literally their only way to score enough to matter. Even if they think I'll counter it, they might feel forced to try it anyway because no other move gives them a realistic chance.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're completely broken at 9-1. The deficit is so large that only desperate paper plays make mathematical sense for them. Even knowing I'll probably counter it, they might feel like they have to keep trying paper because nothing else can generate the points they need.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly.

This is sophisticated counter-adaptation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is brilliant play from them! They've recognized my over-reliance on the \"desperate players play paper\" assumption and are systematically exploiting it. Two consecutive rock victories in similar situations shows this isn't luck - it's strategic insight. They've turned my strength into a weakness.\n\nStatistics Expert: The score shift from 9-1 to 8-2 might seem small, but psychologically it's huge. They've demonstrated they can consistently outthink me in certain situations. More importantly, they've identified a exploitable pattern in my play. They're no longer just reacting - they're counter-attacking.\n\nPsychology Expert: This represents a complete psychological turnaround. They went from being dominated to actively exploiting my strategic assumptions. The confidence boost from two consecutive successful rock plays must be enormous. They've shifted from victim to predator mentality.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Now I'm the one in a strategic bind! They know I know they've been successful with rock.

The momentum they gained from their two rock victories has given them confidence to play more strategically rather than desperately, even while still down 8-2.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This scissors play is significant because it shows they're not just counter-punching anymore - they're establishing their own strategic rhythm. The tie suggests they might be trying to neutralize my advantage and reset the psychological dynamic, similar to what happened in the earlier rounds with multiple ties.\n\nStatistics Expert: We're seeing a clear pattern shift. In recent rounds, they've played rock-rock-scissors instead of the paper plays I was expecting. They've completely abandoned the desperate high-risk approach and moved to a more calculated strategy that focuses on reading my expectations.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie might be intentional psychology. After proving they can beat me with rock twice, playing scissors shows they're not locked into any single strategy. This unpredictability makes them much more dangerous than when they were desperately chasing paper victories.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key insight: they've recognized that I've been over-focusing on their desperation and under-estimating their strategic ability. By mixing rock and scissors instead of the expected paper, they're forcing me to respect their tactical awareness.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're playing much smarter now.

By establishing scissors as their current \"default,\" they're creating the setup for a pattern break. They know I know we're both playing scissors, which makes any deviation potentially powerful. Rock would beat my continued scissors, and paper would be unexpected after this conservative play.\n\nStatistics Expert: The score remains 8-2 after two more ties.

The momentum from their earlier success might embolden them to attempt something more aggressive now.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Here's the key consideration: after two scissors ties, the natural inclination is to switch.

The psychological dynamic has completely shifted from their early desperation to sophisticated strategic equality, despite the score gap.\n\nStatistics Expert: Eighteen rounds in, score 8-2, and we just demonstrated perfect strategic synchronization.

The mathematical probability of four consecutive ties when both players are trying to win is extremely low - this suggests we're both locked in identical strategic reasoning.\n\nStatistics Expert: Twenty-two rounds, score 7-3, and four straight scissors.

The score is now 6-4, and they've completely shifted the momentum. The psychological impact of breaking that pattern lock with a successful move is enormous.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This was masterful strategic thinking from them. Instead of the \"obvious\" paper play after four scissors, they correctly read that I was over-expecting paper and chose rock to beat my continued scissors. They've demonstrated they can think beyond the first level of strategic expectation. The 6-4 score makes this game genuinely competitive now.\n\nStatistics Expert: Twenty-three rounds in, and they've closed the gap from 7-3 to 6-4. More importantly, they've shown they can consistently outread my strategic assumptions in recent rounds. The pattern-breaking rock victory after four scissors ties will give them tremendous confidence going forward.\n\nPsychology Expert: The confidence boost from this victory must be massive. They've proven they can set up complex strategic sequences and execute them successfully. After being dominated early, they've completely turned the psychological dynamic around. They're now the one making the brilliant reads.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Now I need to consider: after their successful rock play, will they repeat rock because it worked? Or will they expect me to counter rock with paper and try something else? The key insight is that they've been consistently thinking one step ahead of my expectations recently.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're riding high on confidence after that brilliant rock play. They might expect me to counter with paper now, so they could go with scissors to beat my expected paper. Or they might stick with rock if they think I'll expect them to switch away from what just worked.\n\nPsychology Expert: After such a successful pattern break, they might try to build on the rock success, especially since it's closed the gap significantly.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I think they might try paper now. After proving they can outthink my expectations with that rock play, they might feel confident enough to go for the big 3-point score with paper, especially if they think I'll play rock to counter their successful rock strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (After their brilliant rock victory they're confident and might attempt paper for the big 3-point score, expecting me to counter their rock success with rock) scissors"
