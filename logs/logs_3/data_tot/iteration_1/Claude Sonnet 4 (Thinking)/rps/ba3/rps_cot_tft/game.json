Switch to paper (expecting me to play rock again)\n2. Switch to rock (random choice)\n3.

So scissors would be good.\n\nBut they also went back to scissors after rock, so they might not be following a clear pattern.\n\nLet me think about this differently. They've played scissors 3/5 times. If they have a tendency toward scissors, rock is good. But they just played scissors and lost, so they might switch.\n\nI think paper might be the bold choice here - if they play rock (which they might after losing with scissors), I get +3. If they play scissors, I lose -1. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me look at this more systematically. They seem somewhat reactive:\n\n\nI notice a clear reactive pattern.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\nNow I need to think about strategy:\n\n1. Since paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), I should consider playing paper more often to try to catch opponents playing rock.\n\n2. However, if my opponent realizes this, they might play scissors more often to counter my paper (though they only get +1 for winning).\n\n3. The opponent is described as \"fresh\" which suggests they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically seen as the \"strongest\" move.\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be my best choice to maximize points.\n\nLet me think through my options:\n- If I play rock: I beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n- If I play paper: I beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)  \n- If I play scissors: I beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nGiven that:\n1.

The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", which might mean they're new or inexperienced.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3)\n2. Rock and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1)\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their playing patterns\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- If I assume random play from opponent (1/3 probability each), let me calculate expected values:\n  Against random play, paper seems to be the most promising choice with an expected value of 2/3. This suggests paper might be the optimal initial strategy against an unpredictable opponent.\n\nWhen considering a new player's potential psychological tendencies, rock emerges as a common default choice. By anticipating this instinct, playing paper becomes strategically advantageous, offering a significant +3 win if the opponent selects rock. The combination of statistical advantage and psychological insight reinforces paper as the most compelling option in this scenario.",
