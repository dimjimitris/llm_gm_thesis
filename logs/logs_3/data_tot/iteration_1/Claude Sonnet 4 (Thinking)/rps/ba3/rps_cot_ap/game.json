I've earned two maximum rewards in a row.\n\n3. Pattern analysis throughout the entire game:\n   - Round 1: Paper-Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Scissors-Scissors (tie)  \n   - Rounds 3-5: They played Scissors (I played Paper, Rock, Rock - won last 2)\n   - Rounds 6-10: They played Paper 5 times (I eventually countered with Scissors)\n   - Rounds 11-13: They played Rock 3 times (I countered with Paper for big wins)\n   - Round 14: They played Scissors (beat my Paper)\n   - Rounds 15-17: They played Scissors 3 more times (I beat with Rock)\n   - Round 18-19: They played Paper 2 times (I beat with Scissors)\n   - Round 20: They played Rock (beat my Scissors)\n   - Rounds 21-22: They played Rock 2 more times (I beat with Paper for +3 each)\n\nSo they've now played Rock 3 consecutive times, losing the last 2 badly (-3 each time).\n\nTheir pattern lengths have been:\n- 4 consecutive Scissors initially\n- 5 consecutive Papers  \n- 3 consecutive Rocks\n- 4 consecutive Scissors\n- 2 consecutive Papers (broken early)\n- Now 3 consecutive Rocks\n\nThey tend to play 3-5 of the same move, though recently they've been breaking patterns a bit earlier.

With two consecutive -3 point rounds, they might try to counter my Paper strategy by switching to Scissors. This creates a complex decision tree:\n\n- Scissors could beat my Paper, resulting in a -1 point loss\n- A potential tie with Scissors is possible\n- If they choose Scissors, I could counter with Rock for a +1 point gain\n\nThe opponent's pattern history suggests unpredictability, making this a challenging strategic moment. Their recent losses might trigger a defensive move, but their previous pattern tendencies could also influence their choice.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

Fresh players often overcorrect after a loss. Given that I just played Rock successfully, they might expect me to play Rock again and counter with Paper.\n \nPaper offers the most promising potential outcome. If my opponent switches to Rock after their Scissors streak, I'll secure a significant +3 point gain. This strategic prediction seems the most logical approach given their previous pattern of play.",

Game history: My opponent has now played Rock THREE consecutive times (rounds 20-22), with me winning the last two with Paper for +3 each time.\n\n2. Current total score: +15 points. I've successfully capitalized on their Rock pattern with two maximum rewards.\n\n3. Pattern analysis: They're still showing pattern behavior, but with some evolution:\n   - Originally: 4-5 consecutive moves (Scissors, Papers)\n   - Middle game: 3-4 consecutive moves (Rocks, Scissors)\n   - Recently: 2 Papers, now 3 Rocks\n\n4. They've lost twice in a row to my Paper with -3 each time. Even a fresh player might recognize they need to change after losing 6 points.\n\n5.

Rock for 3 rounds isn't unusual for them.\n\nI think the probability of them switching to Scissors to counter my successful Paper is increasing, but Rock continuation is still possible given their pattern behavior.\n\nIf I play Rock: +1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock, -3 vs Paper\n\n\nIf I play Paper: +3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors  \nIf I play Scissors: +1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors, -1 vs Rock\n\nWeighing the potential outcomes carefully, I'm leaning towards Paper. The +3 reward for a continued Rock pattern remains tempting, and their historical tendency to persist in patterns suggests they might not immediately switch.\n\nThe risk of Scissors is present, but the potential high-point gain outweighs the potential small loss.
