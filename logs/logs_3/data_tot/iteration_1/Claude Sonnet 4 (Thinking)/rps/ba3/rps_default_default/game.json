There are a few possibilities:\n1. They might stick with paper again if they think it's a good strategy\n2. They might switch to scissors, thinking I'll stick with paper\n3. They might switch to rock for some reason\n\nGiven that we both chose paper (suggesting similar strategic thinking), they might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their potential repeat of paper. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter that.\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper beats rock: +3/-3  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nSince paper vs rock has the highest point differential (+3/-3), there's higher reward but also higher risk. \n\nI think I'll go with rock this time. If they stick with paper (thinking it worked as a safe choice), I'll lose 3 points. But if they switch to scissors (anticipating I might stick with paper), I'll win 1 point. And if they also switch to rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If I think they might anticipate me switching to scissors to counter their potential paper repeat, and they play rock to counter my scissors, then I should play paper to beat their rock. But this is getting into a loop of reasoning.\n\nLet me go with scissors. This beats paper (if they repeat) for 1 point, loses to rock for 1 point, and ties with scissors. It's a more conservative choice than the high-stakes paper vs rock matchup.",

Play rock to beat scissors if they repeat - but they just used scissors so might not repeat\n2. Play paper to beat rock if they go back to their recent rock streak\n3. Play scissors to beat paper if they revert to paper\n\nGiven that they've used paper and rock equally, and just broke a rock streak with scissors, they might go back to paper or rock. Since I'm down significantly, I need to think about maximizing expected value.\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Beats paper (1 point) - they've played paper 6/15 times = 40% chance\n\n\n- Loses to rock (-1 point) - they've played rock 6/15 times = 40% chance\n- Loses to scissors (-1 point) - they've played scissors 3/15 times = 20% chance\n\nCalculating the expected value reveals a slight negative outcome. Analyzing the probabilities suggests a cautious approach might be risky. The mixed play pattern makes predicting their next move challenging, with potential for both gains and losses.\n\nPaper emerges as the most promising strategy, offering higher potential returns. The opponent's recent pattern of rock and scissors hints at a possible rock play, further supporting the paper choice.",
