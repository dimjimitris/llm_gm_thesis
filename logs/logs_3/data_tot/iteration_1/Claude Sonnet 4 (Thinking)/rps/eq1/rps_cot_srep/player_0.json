    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the complete pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n2. My opponent has played rock 6 times, scissors 5 times, and paper 3 times.\n3. They just lost with scissors (beaten by my rock).\n4. Looking at their behavior after scissors losses:\n   - Round 2: scissors lost to my rock, then they played rock in round 3\n   - Round 7: scissors lost to my rock, then they played scissors again in round 8\n   - Round 14: scissors just lost to my rock\n5. The pattern suggests after scissors fails, they often revert to rock (their most-played move).\n6. Rock remains their comfort choice with 6 out of 14 plays, and they tend to return to it after failed experiments.\n7. They've shown they can use all three moves now, but rock is still their foundation.\n8. To beat rock, I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the expected return to rock after the scissors loss.\n\n[move] paper"

They have a 50/50 pattern after scissors wins: sometimes repeat, sometimes switch to rock.\n6. However, they're currently on a 2-round scissors streak (rounds 14-15), and their longest previous streak was 3 rounds.\n7. Given their tendency to have streaks and the fact that scissors just succeeded, they might try for a third scissors in a row.\n8.
