My opponent has played rock 11 times, scissors 6 times, and paper 5 times.\n3. They just won with rock (round 22), beating my scissors.\n4. Looking at their behavior after winning with rock:\n   - Round 3: won with rock, then repeated rock in round 4\n   - Round 18: won with rock, then switched to paper in round 19\n   - Round 22: just won with rock\n5. They're currently on a 2-round rock streak (tie in round 21, win in round 22).\n6. Rock is now their most dominant move (50% of all plays) and just gave them success.\n7. They've shown tendency for 3-round streaks in the past (scissors rounds 6-8, paper rounds 10-12).\n8. After a successful rock win, combined with their rock preference and streak tendency, they'll likely continue with rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely continued rock based on their recent success, streak pattern, and rock being their most-played move.\n\n[move] paper",

They just played rock twice in a row (rounds 20-21 tie, then round 22 win). This gives them a 2-round rock streak.\n\nLooking at their streak behavior:\n- They've had multiple 3-round streaks before (scissors in rounds 6-8, paper in rounds 10-12)\n- Their longest streaks have been 3-4 rounds\n- They just won with rock, which might encourage them to continue\n\nGiven that:\n1. Rock is their most-played move (11 out of 22 rounds = 50%)\n2. They just won with it\n3. They're on a mini-streak \n4. They tend to have longer streaks when successful\n\nThey might continue with rock for a third round.\n\nTo beat rock, I should play paper.",

My opponent has played rock 12 times, scissors 6 times, and paper 5 times.\n3. They just lost with rock (round 23), beaten by my paper, ending a 3-round rock streak.\n4. Looking at their behavior after rock losses to paper:\n   - Round 1: rock lost to paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 4: rock lost to paper \u2192 rock  \n   - Round 13: rock lost to paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 20: rock lost to paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 23: rock just lost to paper\n5. The pattern is 50/50: they switch to scissors or repeat rock after rock losses to paper.\n6. However, they just completed their longest rock streak (3 rounds: tie-win-loss), which suggests they might break the pattern.\n7. After extended streaks that fail, they tend to switch strategies rather than persist.\n8. To beat scissors, I should play rock. If they repeat rock, it's a tie rather than a loss.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the likely switch to scissors after their failed 3-round rock streak.\n\n[move] rock",

After such a long streak that just failed, they might be more likely to switch to scissors this time.\n\nAlso, looking at their overall pattern, they tend to have phases:\n- Early rock phase (rounds 1, 3-5)\n- Scissors phase (rounds 2, 6-8, 14-15)\n- Paper experiment (rounds 10-12, 17, 19)\n- Recent rock dominance (rounds 16, 18, 20-23)\n\nAfter the recent rock phase failed, they might switch to scissors.\n\nTo beat scissors, I should play rock.\nTo beat rock (if they repeat), I would lose with rock, but tie is better than loss.\n\nI think scissors is slightly more likely given the long rock streak that just failed.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

What do they do after wins?\n- After winning with rock in round 3, they played rock again (round 4)\n- After winning with scissors in round 6, they played scissors again (round 7)\n- So after wins, they tend to repeat the winning move\n\nIf they follow this pattern, they might play paper again.\n\nBut paper is new for them - they've only played it once. They might revert to their comfort zones (rock or scissors).\n \nI'll strategize based on their likely next move. If they repeat their paper win, I'll counter with scissors. Should they return to rock or scissors, I'll adjust accordingly - paper against rock, rock against scissors. Their recent paper play suggests unpredictability, so I'll stay alert and flexible.",

Looking at their behavior after rock losses to paper:\n   - Round 1: rock lost to paper, switched to scissors\n   - Round 4: rock lost to paper, repeated rock  \n   - Round 13: rock lost to paper, switched to scissors\n   - Round 20: rock lost to paper, repeated rock\n   - Round 23: rock just lost to paper\n5. The pattern is 50/50 between switching to scissors or repeating rock.\n6. However, they were on a 3-round rock streak (rounds 21-23) that just got broken.\n7. After long streaks fail, they typically switch to their alternative move (scissors).\n8. To beat scissors, I should play rock. If they repeat rock, it's a tie rather than a loss.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the likely switch to scissors after their failed rock streak, or to tie if they stick with rock.\n\n[move] rock",
