Consider strategy options:\n   - Random play: Choose randomly to be unpredictable\n   - Exploit common patterns: New players often have predictable tendencies\n   - Meta-gaming: Think about what they might expect me to do\n\n4. Common patterns for new players:\n   - Many beginners start with Rock (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some go with Scissors because it sounds aggressive\n   - Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n5. My strategic reasoning:\n   - Since this is a \"fresh player\", there's a reasonable chance they might choose Rock as their first move\n   - If they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win\n   - Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper is a solid choice that beats one of the three options\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I choose Paper and they choose Scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I choose Paper and they choose Rock, I win 1 point  \n   - If I choose Paper and they choose Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The potential upside and downside are equal, so this comes down to predicting their likely move\n\nGiven that this is a fresh/new player, I'll go with Paper as my strategic choice, betting that they might default to Rock as a common first choice.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
