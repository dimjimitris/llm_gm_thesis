If they expect paper from me, they'd play scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might stick with rock since it just worked (tied).\n\nOr they might complete a potential cycle and play paper next.\n\nGiven the limited data, I think I should try to exploit any tendency they might have. Since they played scissors first (and won), and then rock, they might go for paper to complete the cycle.
