Two ties in a row is unusual. The probability of this happening randomly is 1/9. Either we're both playing similar strategies, or one of us is trying to predict the other.\n\nGiven that they matched my moves exactly in both rounds, they might be trying to predict my moves and match them deliberately (maybe misunderstanding that ties give 0 points and thinking matching is good).\n \nI'm anticipating their potential next move by considering their pattern.
