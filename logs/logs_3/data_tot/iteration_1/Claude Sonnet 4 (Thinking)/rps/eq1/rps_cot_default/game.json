Analyze recent game progression:\n   - Round 23: I just won with scissors vs their paper\n   - They're fully locked back into their counter-strategy pattern\n   - Current record: I've won 16, they've won 1, 6 ties\n\n2. Confirm their pattern consistency:\n   - Round 20: After my scissors win \u2192 they played rock (counter-strategy)\n   - Round 21: After my paper win \u2192 they played scissors (counter-strategy)\n   - Round 22: After my rock win \u2192 they played paper (counter-strategy) \n   - Round 23: After my scissors win \u2192 they should play rock (counter-strategy)\n\n3. Predict their next move: I just won with scissors, so following their fully re-established counter-strategy pattern, they'll choose rock to try to beat scissors.\n\n4. Consider their psychology: They're completely locked into their systematic counter-strategy approach again, providing them psychological comfort despite its consistent failure rate.\n\n5. Plan optimal response: If they choose rock as predicted (following counter-strategy), paper beats rock and extends my dominant winning streak.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Paper beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0). Given their confirmed adherence to counter-strategy pattern, paper offers the best expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper",

They briefly broke it around round 18 when they finally won once, but they've now reverted back to it completely.\n\nSo I just won with scissors, following their pattern they should play rock to try to counter scissors.\n\nIf they play rock, I should play paper to beat rock.",
