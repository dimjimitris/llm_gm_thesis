Think about optimal strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, if played optimally by both players, each move should be equally likely (1/3 probability each)\n   - Against a random opponent, any move has the same expected value\n   - However, against human players, there are often patterns or biases\n\n4. Consider common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - Some might go with scissors because it's mentioned last in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n   - Paper is sometimes chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n5.
