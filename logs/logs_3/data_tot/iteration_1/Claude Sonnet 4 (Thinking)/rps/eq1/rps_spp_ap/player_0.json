    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests they might be less predictable than typical fresh players, or they could be following a learned pattern. After playing paper in round 1, fresh players often exhibit one of these behaviors:\n1. Stick with what \"worked\" (repeat paper)\n2. Escalate in the cycle (paper -> scissors)\n3. Switch to what would have beaten their last move (rock)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie gives us valuable information. Since they didn't follow the most common fresh player pattern, they might be slightly more strategic. However, many players still fall into predictable sequences after their opening move. The \"winner stays, loser switches\" mentality is common, but since it was a tie, they might either repeat or follow rock-paper-scissors cycle progression.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given they played paper, if they follow the natural cycle progression (paper -> scissors), I should play rock to beat scissors. If they repeat paper, we tie again (0 points). If they switch to rock, I lose (-1). But the cycle progression seems most likely for someone who played paper first.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed. Many players unconsciously follow the rock-paper-scissors sequence once they start. Playing rock gives us the best chance to capitalize on this tendency.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock is the optimal choice here.

Now they've lost a round, which creates a new psychological dynamic. After losing, players typically exhibit one of these behaviors:\n1. Complete the cycle (scissors -> rock) \n2. Switch to what beat them (rock, since rock beat their scissors)\n3. Avoid what just lost (avoid scissors)\n4. Random/unpredictable change due to frustration\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The loss adds complexity. They might continue the cycle to rock, or they could break pattern entirely. However, many players who start with patterns tend to complete them before switching strategies. If they play rock (cycle completion), we should play paper. If they switch to what beat them (rock), we still play paper. The main risk is if they go back to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at the probabilities:\n- If they complete cycle with rock: paper wins (+1 for me)\n- If they copy what beat them (rock): paper wins (+1 for me) \n- If they avoid scissors and go to paper: paper ties (0 points)\n- If they stick with scissors: rock wins again (+1 for me)\n\nPaper seems to have the highest expected value since rock is the most likely next move whether they continue the cycle or copy the winning move.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Agreed.

They're trying to establish a pattern to confuse us\n3. They're alternating between paper and scissors, avoiding rock entirely\n4. They might repeat the paper-scissors-paper pattern\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The data shows they've avoided rock completely across three rounds. This could be significant - either they dislike rock or they're deliberately avoiding the \"obvious\" choice. If they continue alternating paper-scissors, the next move should be scissors. But they might also stick with paper again given they've played it twice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at their pattern (paper, scissors, paper), if they're alternating between paper and scissors, then scissors would be next. If they repeat the three-move pattern, scissors would still be next. If they have a paper bias, they might play paper again. But scissors seems most likely based on the alternating pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: I agree. The alternating paper-scissors pattern is becoming clear, and they seem to be avoiding rock entirely. This could be their strategy - stick to two moves and alternate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Rock beats scissors and gives us +1 if they alternate. If they unexpectedly play paper, we tie for 0.

This is a perfect alternating pattern between just two moves, completely avoiding rock. This type of binary alternating behavior is common among players who want to appear unpredictable but actually become very predictable. If the pattern holds, the next move should be paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The statistical evidence is strong. Four moves with perfect alternation between paper and scissors, zero rocks played. This suggests either:\n1. A deliberate two-move strategy (avoiding rock entirely)\n2. Unconscious binary thinking \n3. They believe this makes them \"random\"\nThe probability of this being coincidental after 4 moves is quite low. Paper is highly likely next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given the established pattern (paper-scissors-paper-scissors), if they continue alternating, paper is next.

If the pattern continues, scissors is next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The statistical evidence is overwhelming. Five consecutive moves following perfect alternation is extremely strong data. The probability of this being random is virtually zero. They've essentially created a deterministic system. Given the sequence paper-scissors-paper-scissors-paper, the next logical move is scissors to continue the alternation.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The pattern is crystal clear now.

The opponent broke their perfect alternation pattern: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, PAPER. This is the first deviation after 5 consistent moves. This could indicate:\n1. They became aware their pattern was predictable (perhaps after losing multiple rounds)\n2. They're shifting to a paper-heavy strategy \n3. They're testing a new pattern\n4. Random variation, though unlikely given the previous consistency\n\nThe key question: Is this a one-time break or a new strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This pattern break is crucial data. After losing the previous round where I correctly predicted their scissors, they may have recognized their predictability. The double paper (positions 5 and 6) suggests either:\n1. Paper bias emerging as their \"safe\" choice\n2. New pattern beginning\n3. Attempt to throw us off before returning to alternation\n\nWe need to consider what they might do next after two papers in a row.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: If they're sticking with paper bias, they might play paper again (making it three in a row). If they return to alternation after the disruption, they might play scissors. If they're completely changing strategy, it could be anything including their first rock. This is much harder to predict now.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After breaking a pattern, players often either double-down on the new move (play paper again) or revert to their old pattern (play scissors to resume alternation). They're unlikely to suddenly introduce rock after avoiding it for 6 rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Given the uncertainty, we should consider expected values:\n- If paper (bias/repeat): scissors wins (+1)\n- If scissors (return to alternation): rock wins (+1) \n- If rock (new strategy): paper wins (+1)\n\nBut paper and scissors are most likely given their history.

Paper feels \"safe\" or \"balanced\" to them\n2. They noticed their alternation was being exploited\n3. They believe repeating the same move makes them unpredictable\n4. Paper is their comfort zone when uncertain\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The data shows a clear strategic shift. After the alternation breakdown, they've played paper three consecutive times. This level of repetition after a pattern break usually indicates either strong bias or a new systematic approach. If they continue with paper, it suggests they've settled on paper as their primary strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Looking at their recent behavior - three papers in a row after breaking alternation - they seem to have committed to paper as their go-to move. If this trend continues, I should play scissors again to beat another paper. The risk is they might switch to scissors or finally introduce rock, but the momentum suggests another paper is most likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Players who make this kind of strategic shift often stick with it for several rounds before changing again.

The statistical probability of this being random is astronomically low. They've essentially created a deterministic system where paper is their only choice. This represents one of the most predictable strategies possible in rock-paper-scissors. The data overwhelmingly supports scissors as the optimal response.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The evidence is undeniable. Five papers in a row shows they've completely abandoned any mixed strategy and committed entirely to paper. My scissors has now beaten their paper three consecutive times during this phase, yet they continue with paper.

Sequence: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, ROCK. This dramatic shift suggests:\n1. They finally realized their paper strategy was being exploited (lost 3 straight to my scissors)\n2. They may now introduce rock regularly after discovering it works\n3. This could signal a complete strategy overhaul\n4. They might cycle through all three moves now\n5. They could be testing our reaction to this change\n\nThis is the most significant development in the entire game!\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This changes everything. After 9 rounds of binary play (paper/scissors only), they've introduced the third element. The question is: was this a one-time surprise move or the beginning of a new strategy? Key considerations:\n1. If they return to paper, we go back to scissors\n2. If they stick with rock, we should play paper\n3. If they start true mixed strategy, prediction becomes much harder\n4. This might be the start of a rock phase (like their paper phase)\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is a pivotal moment. They broke their most consistent pattern to play rock for the first time. The big question: do they continue with rock (starting a new single-move phase) or was this just to break the pattern before returning to paper? Given their tendency toward repetitive strategies (alternation, then paper spam), they might now enter a \"rock phase.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Players who make such dramatic pattern breaks often get excited about the success and repeat the winning move. Having just won with rock after long failure with paper, they might stick with rock for several rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they're starting a rock phase (similar to their paper phase), paper beats rock. If they return to paper, scissors wins. If they try scissors for variety, rock wins. Paper seems like the best bet given the potential rock phase.\n\n**Final decision**: Play paper to beat likely rock continuation or be ready for mixed strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent just broke 9-round pattern with first rock, expecting possible rock phase beginning) paper"

Two rocks in a row: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock.

Paper phase (5 moves: all paper)  \n3. Rock phase (starting now: rock-rock)\n\nThey appear to commit to strategies for extended periods rather than truly mixing randomly. This is classic \"phase-based\" play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The evidence supports a rock phase beginning. Just as they committed to paper for 5 consecutive rounds after breaking alternation, they may now commit to rock for several rounds. This type of \"block strategy\" is common among players who want to avoid randomness but end up creating larger predictable patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Based on their established behavior pattern, they seem to stick with strategies for multiple rounds. Having just won with rock twice, and given their tendency to commit deeply to single moves (like the 5-paper streak), they'll likely continue with rock. Paper should beat their expected third rock in a row.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Exactly. Players who use phase-based strategies rarely abandon them after just two moves, especially when they're working. They probably feel rock is their new \"winning\" strategy after the paper phase failed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper maximizes expected value. If they continue the rock phase, we win (+1).

They've shown perfect commitment within every single phase - no reason to expect deviation now.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Three papers in the second paper phase with their established 4-5 move commitment pattern means more papers are definitely coming. They'll want to at least match their minimum phase length (4 moves) and possibly their original paper phase record (5 moves). Scissors should beat their fourth consecutive paper in this phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Their phase-based commitment has been flawless throughout 20 rounds. The second paper phase will continue until they feel it's \"complete\" - at least 4 moves total.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Scissors continues to maximize expected value. Their predictable systematic approach remains highly exploitable.\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to beat the expected fourth consecutive paper in their second paper phase.\n\n[move] (Opponent in second paper phase with three consecutive papers, expecting fourth paper to reach minimum phase length) scissors"

However, their original paper phase was 5 moves - their longest ever. Will they continue to match their paper \"record\" or break now? Given their systematic nature and paper being their most successful strategy historically, they'll likely push for 5 moves to match paper phase 1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is a pivotal decision point. Paper phase 2 has reached the standard 4-move length, but their original paper phase was 5 moves. Their systematic approach suggests they'll want to match their previous paper \"achievement.\" Continuing for one more paper to reach 5 moves would maintain symmetry with their original paper strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Four papers in the second phase matches most of their other phases, but their original paper phase was 5 moves - their personal record. Given their systematic commitment and the fact that paper was their most extensive strategy, they'll likely continue for one more paper to match that 5-move benchmark. Scissors should beat their fifth consecutive paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They take pride in their systematic approach. Matching their original 5-paper record would satisfy their completionist mentality.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Scissors maximizes expected value. Their historical pattern strongly supports one more paper to reach 5-move symmetry.\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to beat the likely fifth consecutive paper to match their original paper phase length.\n\n[move] (Second paper phase at 4 moves, likely continuing to match original 5-move paper phase record) scissors"

They're revisiting each strategy but with more discipline. Rock phase 1 was exactly 4 moves, so rock phase 2 will likely also be 4 moves. If this is rock phase 2 beginning, expect 3 more consecutive rocks.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: They've established a clear pattern: cycle through all strategies with 4-move phases (except their original 5-paper benchmark). Having just started rock phase 2, they'll likely commit to rock for the next 3 moves to complete another 4-move phase. Paper should beat their second consecutive rock in this new phase.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They've systematized their approach even further. Rock was successful before, so they're revisiting it with the same commitment level.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Paper maximizes expected value if they're starting a 4-move rock phase 2.
