Since they just played scissors and I beat them with paper, they might:\n1. Try rock next (to beat scissors in standard thinking)\n2. Try paper (to beat rock)\n3. Try scissors again\n4. Or try to counter what they think I'll play\n\nI need to think about what they might expect me to play. Since I just won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again, so they might play rock (since rock beats paper). To counter that, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).",
