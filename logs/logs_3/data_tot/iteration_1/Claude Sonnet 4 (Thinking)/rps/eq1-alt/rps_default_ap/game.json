Rock (Rounds 2-10) - 9 consecutive times\n3. Paper (Rounds 11-16) - 6 consecutive times  \n4. Scissors (Rounds 17-22) - 6 consecutive times so far\n\nThe pattern seems to be that they stick with one move for extended periods. They've now played scissors 6 times in a row.\n\nWhen I play rock against scissors, I should win (rock beats scissors), but I've been losing. Wait, let me double-check the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)  \n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\nOh! I've been making an error. Scissors beats rock, not the other way around! That's why I've been losing when playing rock against their scissors.\n\nSo if they're playing scissors, I should play rock... no wait, that's wrong. If they're playing scissors, I should play rock... no, scissors beats rock according to the rules.\n\nLet me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo if they play scissors and I play rock, they win and I lose. That explains why I've been losing.\n\nIf they're going to continue playing scissors, I should play paper (since paper beats scissors).",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They've now played scissors 7 times in a row. Based on their previous patterns (9 rocks, then 6 papers), they might continue with scissors or potentially switch soon.\n\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy in the game rules and my previous understanding. My win/loss record for Round 20 doesn't align with the actual rock-paper-scissors rules. Scissors beats paper, which means I should have lost that round, not won. This inconsistency raises questions about the accuracy of my previous game analysis and record-keeping.\n\nWait, the rules are different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. Paper beats scissors, not the other way around. When I played paper and the opponent played scissors in round 20, I actually lost. The opponent's scissors beat my paper.\n\nThe repeated scissors moves suggest a predictable pattern. I'll counter by playing rock to beat the opponent's consistent scissors strategy.",
