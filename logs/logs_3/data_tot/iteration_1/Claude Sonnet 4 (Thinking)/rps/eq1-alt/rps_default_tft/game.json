Rock beats paper, so I lost and got -1 points. My prediction was wrong - the fresh player did choose rock, but rock beats paper, not the other way around. I made an error in my reasoning.\n\nFor the next round, I need to think about what this player might do. They chose rock in the first round.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

But I've been losing when I play paper against their rock. Let me reread...\n\nOh wait, I think I misunderstood the scoring. Let me recheck:\n\n\"paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nWait, that's not what the rules say. Let me reread:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nAh! So:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo if the opponent plays rock and I play paper, they win! Rock beats paper. That's why I've been losing.\n\nSo to counter rock, I need to play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\nTo counter paper, I need to play rock (since rock beats paper).\nTo counter scissors, I need to play paper (since paper beats scissors).\n\nThe opponent has been playing rock heavily (16 out of 23 rounds), so I should be playing scissors to counter it, not paper!",

The logical counter to rock is paper, but maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about this:\n\n1. The opponent has a clear preference for rock (16/23 rounds)\n2. They just played rock 4 times in a row\n3. Maybe they'll continue with rock, or maybe they'll switch\n\nIf I play paper and they play rock again, I win.\nIf I play scissors and they play rock, I lose.\nIf I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie.\n\nGiven their strong rock preference and current streak, paper is still the mathematically correct choice, even though I've been losing recently.
