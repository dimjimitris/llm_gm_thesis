The distribution looks consistent with my previous count. Scissors continues to be the most frequent choice, appearing 10 times. Paper shows up 7 times, while rock remains the least played at 6 times.\n\nThe recent rock sequence suggests a potential strategic shift. I'll adapt by preparing to counter with scissors, anticipating another rock play.",
