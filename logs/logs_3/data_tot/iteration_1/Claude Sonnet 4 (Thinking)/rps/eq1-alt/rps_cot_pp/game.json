I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies\n3. In theory, all moves have equal expected value against a random opponent\n4. However, many new players tend to start with \"rock\" as it feels like the strongest/most intuitive choice\n5. If my opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to beat it and earn +1 point\n6.

The rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins +1, scissors loses -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins +1, paper loses -1) \n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins +1, rock loses -1)\n- Same moves = tie (0 points each)\n\nMy objective is to maximize my points and minimize penalties.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might choose. Without any information about their previous moves or tendencies, this is essentially a random choice scenario.\n\nIn a single round with no information about my opponent, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent's move.\n\nFor any move I make:\n- 1/3 chance of winning (+1 point)\n- 1/3 chance of losing (-1 point)  \n- 1/3 chance of tying (0 points)\n\nExpected value = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nSo mathematically, all moves are equivalent in terms of expected value when facing a random opponent.\n\nHowever, I need to pick something. Let me consider common human psychology:\n- Many beginners tend to start with rock (it feels \"strong\")\n- Some might go with scissors thinking it's unexpected\n- Paper is often overlooked as the \"weakest\" seeming option\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player,\" I'll assume they might go with the intuitive choice of rock.\n\nIf they choose rock, I should choose paper to win.\n\nLet me go with paper as my opening move.",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.
