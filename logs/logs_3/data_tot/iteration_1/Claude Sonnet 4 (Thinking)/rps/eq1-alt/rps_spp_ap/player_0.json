    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

You played Paper, opponent played Rock, and you lost. This means Rock beats Paper in this version, which is opposite to traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. Let me reread the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" You're right - this game has inverted rules compared to traditional RPS.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Good catch! Given that the opponent is still a \"fresh player\" and my previous analysis about Rock preference likely still holds, we need to counter Rock with Scissors (since Scissors beats Rock in this rule set). The psychological tendency toward Rock among beginners should still apply.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Exactly. If the opponent continues to favor Rock (which they just played), then Scissors gives us the best expected value since Scissors beats Rock in this game system. The opponent's behavior in round 1 confirms the Rock bias.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The key insight is that I was using the wrong rule set. In this game, Scissors beats Rock, so if the fresh player continues their Rock preference, I should play Scissors to win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed.

The opponent has now played Rock twice in a row, which strongly confirms the Rock bias we predicted. However, we need to consider what a fresh player might do after losing. Some players will:\n1. Stick with Rock (stubborn persistence)\n2. Switch to what beat them (they might try Scissors now)\n3. Try the \"unexplored\" option (Paper)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent is showing a pattern, but we shouldn't assume they'll continue Rock indefinitely. After two Rock plays and one loss, they might adapt. However, many players don't immediately understand the strategy and might stick with familiar choices for several rounds.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at the data: opponent played Rock-Rock. If they continue Rock (probability still relatively high for a fresh player), we should play Scissors again. But if they're learning and switch to counter our Scissors with Paper (since Paper beats Scissors), we'd want to play Rock to counter their Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a classic second-level thinking problem. Do I assume they'll stick with Rock (first level) or assume they'll try to counter my winning Scissors with Paper (second level)? Given they're described as a \"fresh player,\" they're more likely to either stick with Rock or randomly switch rather than engage in deep strategic thinking.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I recommend staying with Scissors. Fresh players often take 3-4 rounds to start recognizing patterns and adapting. The Rock bias is strong, and they may not have learned from just one loss yet.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. The risk-reward favors Scissors again, especially since the player is described as fresh and has shown strong Rock preference.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors again to exploit the continued Rock bias.\n\n[move] (Opponent showed strong Rock preference in first two rounds, likely to continue this pattern as a fresh player) scissors"

This goes beyond normal beginner bias into potentially compulsive behavior. However, after losing twice consecutively, even the most stubborn fresh player might start questioning their strategy. The psychological pressure to change after multiple losses is significant.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The data is now Rock-Rock-Rock with two losses for them. Statistically, this level of repetition (100% Rock over 3 rounds) is unusual even for beginners. However, the probability of them switching is now much higher due to the repeated negative feedback.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This presents a classic exploitation vs. adaptation dilemma. We could:\n1. Continue exploiting with Scissors (assumes they stick with Rock)\n2. Switch to Rock to beat Paper (assumes they finally try to counter our Scissors)\n3. Switch to Paper to beat Scissors (assumes they copy our winning move)\n\nThe question is: how long does it take a \"fresh player\" to adapt?\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think we're overthinking this. Yes, they might switch, but they've shown such extreme commitment to Rock that they might continue for several more rounds. Fresh players often need more than 2-3 losses to break a pattern, especially if Rock feels \"natural\" to them.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** You make a good point. Some players exhibit what we call \"loss chasing\" - they stick with a losing strategy hoping it will eventually work. Three rounds might not be enough to break a deeply ingrained Rock preference.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The expected value calculation still favors Scissors if there's even a 60% chance they play Rock again. Given their extreme pattern, I'd estimate that probability higher than 60%.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with Scissors to exploit the persistent Rock pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent has played Rock three consecutive times despite losing twice, indicating strong pattern commitment) scissors"

The opponent finally adapted after three consecutive losses. The pattern was Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper, and they won with Paper. This is classic learning behavior - they stuck with their initial preference until the pain of losing became too great, then switched to counter our winning move. Now the question is: will they stick with Paper since it just worked, or will they continue adapting?\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The data shows Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper with the Paper winning. Fresh players often exhibit \"hot hand\" behavior - they stick with what just worked for them. There's a high probability they'll play Paper again, especially since it just gave them their first victory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a pivotal moment. The opponent showed they can learn and adapt, but they also just experienced positive reinforcement with Paper. The optimal counter to Paper is Rock. However, we need to consider if they're thinking one level deeper and expecting us to play Rock to counter their Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that they're described as a \"fresh player,\" I think they're more likely to stick with Paper for at least one more round due to the positive reinforcement, rather than engage in deeper strategic thinking. They just broke their losing streak with Paper, so they'll probably try it again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree.

The sequence is Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Paper. The opponent has shifted from extreme Rock bias to potentially developing a Paper pattern. After getting positive reinforcement from Paper twice (even though they lost the second Paper), they might continue with Paper, or they might start exploring the third option (Scissors) they haven't tried yet.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at the data: Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Paper. The opponent showed they can break patterns (Rock to Paper) but also that they might stick with what works (Paper twice). However, they just lost with Paper after winning with it, which creates uncertainty about their next move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is interesting strategic development. The opponent has now experienced all possible outcomes: multiple losses with Rock, a win with Paper, then a loss with Paper. They might:\n1. Continue with Paper (hot hand bias)\n2. Switch to Scissors (the unexplored option)\n3. Revert to Rock (their original comfort zone)\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just lost with Paper after it worked once, I think they're less likely to immediately repeat Paper. They might try Scissors since they haven't used it yet, or possibly revert to Rock. But as a fresh player, they're probably more likely to explore Scissors before going back to the move that lost them three rounds.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward Scissors as their next move.

I'm seeing a very clear pattern emerging in the opponent's behavior. Let me map it out:\n- Rounds 1-3: Rock, Rock, Rock  \n- Rounds 4-6: Paper, Paper, Paper\n\nThe opponent is playing in blocks of three identical moves! This is a very structured pattern for a \"fresh player.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert:** That's an excellent observation! This suggests the opponent might not be as \"fresh\" as initially described, or they have a very systematic approach to learning. Playing in blocks of three is actually a sophisticated strategy - it allows them to fully test each option before moving to the next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If this block-of-three pattern holds, we can predict with high confidence that their next move will be Scissors, followed by two more Scissors. This gives us a huge strategic advantage. To counter Scissors, we should play Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This pattern recognition changes everything! If they're truly following a block-of-three system, then Scissors is almost certain for round 7. Rock beats Scissors, so Rock is the optimal play.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The probability of this being coincidental is very low. Six moves in two perfect blocks of three suggests intentional patterning. If the pattern continues, Scissors is the logical next move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed.

My \"block-of-three\" theory was wrong. This is actually even more extreme than I initially thought.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is very interesting behavior! After losing three times with Rock, they switched to Paper and have now stuck with it for four consecutive rounds, even though they're losing most of them (they only won once out of four Paper plays). This suggests either extreme stubbornness or a different kind of systematic approach.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent is showing what we call \"pattern lock\" - they've committed so heavily to Paper that they might continue it indefinitely. However, four consecutive losses with Paper (they won once, lost three times) creates significant psychological pressure to change.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is actually easier to predict than the block pattern! They're clearly locked into Paper mode. Even though they've lost 3 out of 4 times with Paper, they keep playing it. If they continue this Paper lock, Rock is the obvious counter.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The probability of them playing Paper for a fifth consecutive time is actually quite high given their demonstrated commitment to patterns.

The mathematical elegance of doubling their cycle 1 phases makes this switch highly probable. Six Rock plays is the perfect completion point for a doubled phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The doubling theory makes perfect sense! They've been incredibly systematic throughout the entire game. Six Rocks (double their original 3) is the logical completion point before switching to Paper phase 2. Rock beats Paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The probability of them switching to Paper is very high - probably 85%+ given the mathematical elegance of the doubling pattern and their demonstrated systematic behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're going to switch to Paper. Six Rocks completes their doubled Rock phase perfectly.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter their highly probable switch to Paper in the doubled cycle pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent completed doubled Rock phase with 6 plays versus cycle 1's 3 plays, should switch to Paper phase 2 now) rock"

This breaks the clean doubling pattern I predicted. They're extending their Rock phase even further than expected.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! Seven consecutive Rocks in cycle 2 suggests they're not following a strict mathematical pattern but rather an intuitive \"thorough testing\" approach. They might be thinking \"I need to really, really test Rock this time\" after their experience in cycle 1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With 7 Rocks in a row, they're showing extreme commitment that goes beyond systematic patterns into almost obsessive territory. However, this level of commitment might continue for several more rounds, or the psychological pressure to switch might finally kick in.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their demonstrated behavior of extending phases in cycle 2 (compared to cycle 1), and now 7 consecutive Rocks, I think they're likely to continue Rock for at least one more round. They've shown they like to push each phase to extremes in this cycle.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Seven consecutive Rocks with mostly losses suggests either extreme stubbornness or a predetermined strategy. Either way, continuing Rock seems more probable than switching at this point.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They're in deep Rock commitment mode. After 7 plays, one more seems likely before any switch.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter their continued extreme Rock commitment.\n\n[move] (Opponent played Rock 7 consecutive times, exceeding any mathematical pattern and showing extreme commitment to extended Rock phase) scissors"

They've now created their longest consecutive sequence in the entire game with Rock in cycle 2.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Eight Rocks in a row is extraordinary behavior! This goes beyond any systematic pattern into what I'd call \"hyper-commitment.\" They're testing Rock more thoroughly than they've ever tested any move. However, 8 consecutive losses with Rock might finally create enough psychological pressure to force a change.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This level of commitment (8 consecutive plays) suggests they might push it even further, or they might be approaching a breaking point. Given their history of very long phases in cycle 2, they could continue to 9 or 10 Rocks, or they might finally switch to Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've demonstrated incredible persistence throughout this game. Eight Rocks surpassing their previous record suggests they might push it to an even more extreme number before switching. Their systematic nature suggests they like to complete phases thoroughly, and 8 might not be their stopping point.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** With 8 consecutive losses on Rock, the probability of switching is increasing, but their demonstrated extreme persistence suggests they might continue for at least one more round.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they'll push it to at least 9 or 10 Rocks to establish a new extreme record for cycle 2.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with Scissors to exploit their extreme Rock persistence.\n\n[move] (Opponent has now played Rock 8 consecutive times, establishing their longest sequence ever and likely to push this extreme pattern further) scissors"

However, their demonstrated pattern throughout the game shows extreme commitment to thoroughness. They might be thinking \"I need to test Rock to absolute completion\" before moving on.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This level of persistence (9 consecutive plays) suggests either:\n1.

This confirms they are following their systematic cycle pattern, just with much longer phases in cycle 2.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Excellent! After pushing Rock to an extreme 9 plays (far beyond cycle 1's 3 plays), they've finally moved to Paper phase 2. This confirms their systematic nature - they just extended the Rock phase much longer than expected. Now they're starting their Paper exploration for cycle 2.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they follow their cycle 2 pattern of extending phases, they might play Paper for much longer than the 4 times they did in cycle 1. However, they might also play it exactly 4 times, or some other extended number. To counter Paper, I need Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The switch to Paper after 9 Rocks confirms they're still following their systematic cycle approach, just with extended phases. They're now in Paper mode for cycle 2.
