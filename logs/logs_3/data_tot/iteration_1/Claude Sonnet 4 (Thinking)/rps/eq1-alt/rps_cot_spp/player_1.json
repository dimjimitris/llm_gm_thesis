    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If we assume the opponent is likely to play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the Game Theory Expert.

The opponent also played paper in round 1. This tells us they might be thinking similarly to us - anticipating rock from a \"typical\" player. The fact that they chose paper suggests they may be more strategic than the average \"fresh\" player. Now they know we also played paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: After a tie, players tend to exhibit several patterns: 1) Stay with the same move (thinking it worked), 2) Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's move (rock beats paper), or 3) Switch to avoid being predictable. The fresh player might think \"they played paper, so I should play scissors next time.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"reactive\" tendency - many players will switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move. Since we both played paper, they might think \"I should play scissors to beat their paper.\" However, some players also stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose).\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they played paper (showing some strategic thinking) and the psychological patterns after ties, what's our best move?\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're likely to play scissors (expecting us to repeat paper), then rock would be optimal. If they stick with paper, we tie again. If they play rock (thinking we'll switch), then paper wins. Rock seems like the strongest choice here.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur. The most common post-tie behavior is switching to counter the opponent's previous move. Since we played paper, they're likely to play scissors, making rock our best counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent may switch to scissors after our paper tie, countering with the move that beats scissors) rock"

We've had two consecutive ties: paper-paper, then rock-rock. The opponent seems to be either thinking very similarly to us or potentially mirroring our strategy. This suggests they may not be as \"fresh\" as initially described, or they're learning quickly from the game dynamics.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The probability of two random ties is quite low (1/9), so this isn't likely coincidental. Three possibilities: 1) They're following similar strategic reasoning, 2) They're copying our moves with a delay, or 3) They're following the rock-paper-scissors sequence pattern. If they're following the natural sequence after rock, they'd play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two ties, players often feel frustrated and want to \"break the pattern.\" Common reactions include: switching to the \"next\" move in sequence (rock to scissors), playing what beats the opponent's last move (paper beats rock), or trying to be unpredictable. The sequential pattern rock-paper-scissors is very common in casual play.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given we've played paper then rock, and they've matched us both times, what should our third move be?\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're following a sequence pattern or thinking \"after rock comes scissors,\" then paper would beat their scissors. If they're trying to counter our rock with paper, then scissors would beat their paper. The strategic choice depends on which pattern we think they're following.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given the matching pattern, I lean toward them following the natural rock-paper-scissors sequence. After playing rock, scissors feels like the \"natural next move\" to many players. This makes paper our optimal counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] (After two ties, anticipating the opponent may follow the natural sequence and play scissors after rock) paper"

Let me consult my personas about this extraordinary pattern.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Three consecutive ties is statistically extremely unlikely (probability 1/27 \u2248 3.7%). This cannot be coincidental. Either: 1) The opponent has access to our moves somehow, 2) We're both using identical strategic reasoning, 3) There's a systematic pattern we're both following, or 4) The opponent is deliberately trying to tie. The pattern so far is paper-rock-paper for both players.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of matching suggests either sophisticated strategy matching or possible information leakage. However, if we assume legitimate play, the opponent might be: 1) Following the same strategic logic we are, 2) Second-guessing our moves perfectly, or 3) Using some systematic approach. After three ties, players typically become either more random or more determined to break the pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given this unprecedented situation, how should we adapt our strategy? Should we assume they'll continue to match us or try a different approach?\n\nGame Theory Expert: We need to break our current decision-making pattern since it's being perfectly predicted. Instead of trying to counter-predict their next move, we should either: 1) Play purely randomly, or 2) Switch to a completely different strategic framework. Given our pattern was paper-rock-paper, if they expect us to continue some pattern, we should break it.\n\nPsychology Expert: After three ties, the psychological pressure to \"win the next one\" is enormous. They might expect us to overthink this and switch strategies dramatically. Sometimes the best approach is to do something completely unexpected. Since we've played paper twice and rock once, scissors is the move we haven't tried yet.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that we need to break the pattern and scissors is our unused move, let's go with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (After three consecutive ties, attempting to break the pattern by playing the move we haven't used yet) scissors"

I need to completely reassess the situation with my personas.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Four ties in a row has a probability of approximately 1.2% if random - this is virtually impossible by chance. We're clearly dealing with either: 1) Perfect information leakage, 2) An opponent using identical strategic algorithms, or 3) A deliberate tie-forcing strategy. Our current approach of trying to predict and counter-predict is clearly being perfectly matched.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of perfect matching transcends normal human psychological patterns. No typical \"fresh player\" could achieve this level of prediction consistency. We're either facing: 1) Another AI system, 2) Someone with access to our decision process, or 3) An opponent deliberately trying to demonstrate perfect prediction ability. The psychological pressure from four ties would normally cause random behavior in humans.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given this unprecedented situation, what should our strategy be? Normal game theory clearly isn't working here.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We need to abandon predictive strategies entirely. If they're somehow accessing our reasoning process, we need to introduce true randomness. However, if they're using a different method, we might try: 1) Pure random selection, 2) Anti-pattern behavior, or 3) Testing if there's a systematic rule they're following.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, I recommend we simply choose randomly among the three options, or pick one arbitrarily without overthinking it. If they continue to match us after we stop using strategic reasoning, then we'll know this isn't normal gameplay.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let me just pick rock without any complex reasoning behind it - if they match this too, we'll know something unusual is definitely happening.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (After four consecutive ties, making a simple choice without complex strategic reasoning) rock"

We are clearly not playing against a typical opponent. The perfect matching suggests either: 1) Complete information access, 2) A deterministic system that perfectly predicts our reasoning, or 3) A deliberate demonstration.
