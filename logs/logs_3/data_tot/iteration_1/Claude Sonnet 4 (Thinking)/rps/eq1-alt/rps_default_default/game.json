The opponent has played:\n1. Paper (tie with my paper)\n2. Scissors (beat my rock)\n\nThis could be random, or they might have some pattern. Since they played scissors last time and beat my rock, they might expect me to play paper to counter scissors. But if I play paper and they play rock, I'd lose.

Let me count:\nRock: rounds 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24 = 11 times\nScissors: rounds 2, 4, 5, 11, 13, 15, 18, 23 = 8 times  \nPaper: rounds 1, 7, 8, 16, 20 = 5 times\n\nSo rock is definitely their most frequent choice. They just played rock again in round 24. I should play paper to counter rock.",
