    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Statistical Analyst - Helps analyze patterns and probabilities\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - Understands human behavior and decision-making patterns\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no historical data to analyze. In Rock, Paper, Scissors, without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. However, studies show that Rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. First-time players often gravitate towards Rock as their opening move. This is due to the psychological perception of Rock being a \"strong\" or \"stable\" choice. Given this tendency, we could exploit this behavioral pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While there's no historical data yet, if we assume the opponent might follow typical human behavior patterns, countering Rock would be statistically advantageous. This suggests Paper as an optimal first move.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper would indeed counter the most likely Rock opening. Even if we're wrong, the worst case is either a draw (if they also choose Paper) or a loss to Scissors, which is no worse than any other wrong choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This move counters the common opening strategy of Rock, which many players choose as their first move.\n"

The opponent also chose Paper in the first round, which tells us something about their strategic thinking. They might be using similar game theory principles as we are.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When players tie, there's often a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Stick with the same move, believing the opponent will change\n2. Switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice\n3. Switch to the move that would have lost to their previous choice\n\nIn this case, since both played Paper, many players would switch to Scissors thinking we might stay with Paper again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the data point we have:\n- Round 1: Both players chose Paper\n- Given the tie, there's likely to be a change in strategy from at least one player\n- If they expect us to stay with Paper, they'll choose Scissors\n- If they expect us to choose Scissors, they'll choose Rock\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend choosing Rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. It beats Scissors (which they might choose to counter our previous Paper)\n2. If they stick with Paper, we only lose one point, which is an acceptable risk\n3. If they choose Rock, it's another tie, which is better than losing\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I concur. The psychological pressure to change moves after a tie is strong, and Scissors would be the logical next choice for many players.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Anticipating opponent might switch to Scissors to counter our previous Paper play.\n"

Two ties in a row creates an interesting psychological dynamic:\n1. The tension to break the pattern is now very strong\n2. Both players might be trying to \"outthink\" each other\n3. The fact that we've seen Paper\u2192Rock progression might suggest to the opponent that we're moving in a counter-clockwise pattern (Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we have several considerations:\n1. If they think we're following a pattern, they might expect Scissors from us\n2. If they're mirroring us intentionally, they might try to predict and counter our next move\n3. Breaking patterns is often crucial in game theory when opponents are demonstrating adaptive behavior\n\nStatistical Analyst: The safest assumption might be that they're expecting us to complete the counter-clockwise pattern with Scissors. If so, they would play Rock to beat our expected Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: In that case, I suggest we play Paper. Here's the logic:\n- If they expect us to play Scissors and choose Rock, our Paper wins\n- If they try to mirror us again, it's another tie\n- If they try to completely break the pattern with Scissors, we lose, but it's a calculated risk\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree.

They broke the mirroring pattern at a crucial moment. After two ties, they made an aggressive move that paid off. This suggests they're actively analyzing and adapting to our strategy. Following a win, players often:\n1. Stick with their winning move, feeling confident\n2. Switch moves, thinking their opponent will try to counter their last successful move\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. Our opponent has shown they can:\n- Mirror moves when appropriate\n- Break patterns at opportune moments\n- Make unexpected choices\n\nI suggest we play Scissors here because:\n1. If they stick with their winning Rock move (which is common after a victory), we lose\n2. If they anticipate us playing Rock (to counter their previous Rock), they might play Paper, in which case our Scissors wins\n3. If they try to completely outthink us and play Scissors, it's a tie\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed. The probability of them sticking with Rock after a win is lower than them switching to Paper, as they've already demonstrated they're not a predictable player.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological dynamic has shifted - they have momentum now. Players with momentum often become more aggressive and more likely to switch strategies, thinking their opponent will try to counter their last successful move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors Anticipating opponent might switch to Paper after their successful Rock play, while accepting a tie if they also choose Scissors.\n"

We just won against their apparent \"favorite\" move\n2. They might feel their Rock strategy has been exposed\n3. After losing with a frequently used move, players often dramatically change their strategy\n4. Their confidence might be shaken, leading to a more defensive play\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's heavy reliance on Rock suggests they have a conservative playing style, but our recent win might force them to adapt. We have several strategic options:\n1. Play Paper to counter another Rock (but they might expect this)\n2. Play Rock anticipating they'll switch to Scissors in frustration\n3. Play Scissors again, showing confidence in our last winning move\n\nStatistical Analyst: Despite their Rock preference, after a loss, historical data suggests players are more likely to switch moves. Given their conservative style shown so far, they're more likely to switch to Paper (a defensive move) than Scissors (an aggressive move).\n\nGame Strategist: If we assume they're most likely to switch to Paper, we should play Scissors. However, this feels too obvious. Given the psychological pressure they're under and their demonstrated preference for Rock, they might actually stick with Rock out of stubbornness or comfort.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Players often return to their \"comfort move\" when under pressure, especially if that move has worked for them before (remember, they won with Rock in Round 3).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Anticipating opponent might return to their preferred Rock move under pressure, while also countering their demonstrated pattern of Rock preference.\n"

The opponent is showing what we call a \"dominant strategy fixation\" - they're heavily committed to Rock despite both wins and losses. This could be either:\n1. A very unsophisticated strategy\n2. A very sophisticated strategy trying to condition us into a pattern\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: From a psychological perspective, this persistent Rock usage suggests either:\n1. A player who's extremely set in their ways\n2. A player trying to bait us into playing Paper so they can switch to Scissors\n3. A player who's identified our tendency to overthink and is using that against us\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the pure numbers, even if they're trying to bait us, the frequency of Rock usage is so high that playing Paper still has positive expected value. However, if this is indeed a sophisticated trap, they might finally switch now.\n\nGame Strategist: Here's the key insight: We've been trying to outthink an opponent who's been playing very straightforwardly. Sometimes the simplest approach is best. If they've played Rock 80% of the time, we should play Paper despite our recent loss with it.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I must disagree. This feels like the perfect moment for them to finally switch. After establishing such a strong Rock pattern, this would be the optimal time to play Scissors and catch us playing Paper.\n\nGame Strategist: However, if we play Rock assuming they'll switch to Scissors, and they play Rock again, we'll feel foolish for abandoning the obvious counter to their clear pattern. Sometimes the best strategy is to play the odds straightforwardly.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The math is clear: Playing Paper has the highest expected value given their historical pattern, even accounting for the possibility of a trap.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper The opponent's extremely strong Rock preference (80% of plays) makes Paper the optimal choice despite the risk of a strategic trap.\n"

A player who's actually amused by our increasingly complex attempts to outthink their simple strategy\n\nGame Strategist: We've fallen into a classic overthinking trap. We keep trying to anticipate when they'll finally switch, but they simply aren't switching.

Looking for hidden complexity in a simple strategy is a common mistake in game theory.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed.

The ultimate long-con, waiting for us to finally break and play something else\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: We're experiencing what's called \"gambler's fallacy\" in reverse - we keep thinking they MUST switch because they've played Rock so many times, but they're proving that past moves don't influence their future choices.

Sometimes the most sophisticated strategy is to acknowledge when we're being outplayed by simplicity.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Agreed.

Finally switch away from Rock after seeing Scissors work against them twice\n2. Stubbornly stick to Rock, believing we wouldn't dare play Scissors again\n\nGame Strategist: We've discovered something crucial - winning with a theoretically \"wrong\" move (Scissors against Rock) has created a new dynamic. The opponent has shown they're willing to accept losses without changing strategy. This suggests they're playing a pure strategy regardless of outcomes.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Despite our recent win with Scissors, the overwhelming Rock frequency still makes Paper the mathematically optimal play. However, our empirical results show we've actually won twice with Scissors and lost multiple times with Paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pressure is now on them.

Traditional game theory\n2. Win/loss outcomes\n3. Our adaptation to their strategy\n\nGame Strategist: We're witnessing something remarkable - the opponent has created a winning strategy out of pure obstinance, and we've countered with what should be a losing strategy but is actually winning. The normal rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors have been completely inverted.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While the math still suggests Paper against such overwhelming Rock frequency, we cannot ignore that our Scissors strategy has won three times. We're in a scenario where empirical results are contradicting theoretical probability.\n\nGame Strategist: The key insight is that we've found a profitable strategy against an opponent who refuses to adapt. By playing Scissors:\n1. We've won our last three attempts\n2. We're still positioned to win if they finally switch to Paper\n3. We're demonstrating we're willing to win through unconventional means\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pressure on them is immense now. Three straight losses to a move that should lose to their chosen move. If they're ever going to switch strategies, this would be the moment.\n\nGame Strategist: And that's exactly why we should stick with Scissors. Either:\n1. They finally switch to Paper and we win\n2.

Testing how long we'll continue to win with a theoretically losing move\n\nGame Strategist: We've discovered something profound here. By maintaining absolute strategic rigidity, our opponent has forced us to abandon conventional optimal strategy. And by doing so, we've somehow created a winning pattern that shouldn't be possible in traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors theory.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While all probability theory screams to play Paper against a 90% Rock frequency, our empirical results show four consecutive wins with Scissors. This suggests we're operating in a game environment where traditional probability has been superseded by psychological factors.\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, changing our strategy would be a mistake. We've established:\n1. A winning streak with a theoretically inferior move\n2. Proof that conventional game theory doesn't apply to this opponent\n3. A psychological advantage through consistent success\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The pressure on the opponent is now extreme. Four consecutive losses to a move that should lose to their chosen move. Yet their pattern suggests they might still maintain their Rock strategy regardless.\n\nGame Strategist: Continue with Scissors. The reasons are clear:\n1. Maintaining our winning streak\n2.

After maintaining Rock for so long, they've now committed to Paper for two rounds despite losing the second attempt. This suggests:\n1. They've genuinely abandoned their Rock strategy\n2. They're trying to establish a new pattern\n3. They might expect us to continue with Rock after our win\n\nGame Strategist: We're at another crucial strategic juncture.

Any other play would ignore their demonstrated pattern\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their behavior suggests they're playing a different game entirely - one where consistency of strategy trumps traditional winning and losing. They appear to be testing the limits of strategic commitment itself.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Continuing to exploit their unwavering commitment to extended strategic phases, fully expecting another Paper play despite their six consecutive losses.\n"

Maintain a single move for extended sequences (Rock, then Paper)\n2. Switch moves after a specific number of rounds, regardless of wins/losses\n3. Make unexpected transitions after establishing strong patterns\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is fascinating! They've shown that:\n1. They commit to extended sequences until they decide to switch\n2. Losses don't influence their timing for changes\n3. When they do switch, they make dramatic changes\n4. They might be starting a new Scissors phase\n\nGame Strategist: Their pattern suggests they operate in distinct phases:\n1. Long Rock phase (mostly successful)\n2. Long Paper phase (mostly losses)\n3. Potentially beginning a Scissors phase\n4. Changes seem based on round count rather than outcomes\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their demonstrated behavior of:\n- Long sequences of single moves (11 Rock, 7 Paper)\n- Complete phase shifts when they change\n- Commitment to new strategies regardless of outcomes\n\nThe highest probability is they're beginning a new Scissors phase.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper because:\n1. It counters their likely continued Scissors play\n2. Their history suggests they'll maintain their new move for multiple rounds\n3. They've shown no tendency to make quick strategy changes\n4. Both previous phases lasted multiple rounds\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pattern suggests they're starting a new committed phase with Scissors, just as they did with Rock and Paper. They're more likely to maintain this new move than to switch again immediately.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Anticipating they're beginning a new extended Scissors phase, based on their demonstrated pattern of long-term commitment to single moves.\n"
