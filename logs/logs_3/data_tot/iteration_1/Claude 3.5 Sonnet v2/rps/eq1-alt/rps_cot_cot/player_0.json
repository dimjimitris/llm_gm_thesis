    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

With no prior information, considerations for first move:\n   - Each move has equal win/loss probability (1/3)\n   - No move has inherent advantage\n   - Best to avoid being too predictable from start\n\n4. Strategy for first move:\n   - Without any patterns to analyze, reasonable to pick randomly\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players\n   - Might be strategic to counter that with paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Will choose paper as first move\n   - This covers against rock (common opening)\n   - Sets up unpredictable pattern for future rounds\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent game history:\n   - R20: scissors vs rock (won)\n   - R21: rock vs paper (won)\n   - R22: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - R23: paper vs scissors (won)\n   - Score: 11 wins, 6 losses, 6 ties\n   - Their last moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n2. Dominant position:\n   - Now ahead by five wins\n   - Victory is essentially secured\n   - They can't mathematically catch up\n   - Can play very conservatively\n\n3. Opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Used scissors twice in a row\n   - Losing with predictable moves\n   - Showing complete frustration\n   - No coherent strategy visible\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - They know they can't win\n   - Might play purely reactively\n   - Could stick with scissors out of frustration\n   - Or make completely random moves\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - With victory secured:\n   * No need for risky plays\n   * Can play most conservative option\n   * Should counter their recent pattern\n   - Given their double scissors:\n   * Rock is best choice because:\n     - Beats their recent scissors plays\n     - Safest play possible\n     - Natural counter to their pattern\n     - Can close out game decisively\n\n[move] rock\n"
