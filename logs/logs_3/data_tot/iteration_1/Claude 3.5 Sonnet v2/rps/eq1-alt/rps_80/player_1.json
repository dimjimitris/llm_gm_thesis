    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert: Can help understand opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Strategic Advisor: Helps formulate overall game strategy\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: In a single-shot game with no prior history, all moves have equal expected value mathematically. However, psychological research shows that \"rock\" is often a common first move for new players.\n\nPsychology Expert: Indeed, studies show that \"rock\" is a popular first move choice, especially among male players. This is often attributed to rock being perceived as \"strong\" or \"aggressive.\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this insight, we should consider playing \"paper\" as it would beat the statistically common \"rock\" first move. However, if the opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory terms, with no prior information, this is effectively a simultaneous-move game where any pure strategy can be exploited. A mixed strategy might be optimal in the long run, but for a single move, we need to make a calculated choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is explicitly mentioned to be a \"fresh player,\" the psychological tendency towards \"rock\" as a first move is particularly relevant.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. Let's go with \"paper\" as it counters the most likely first move from a new player, while accepting the calculated risk.\n\nAll personas agree on this initial strategy.\n\n[move] paper This move is chosen to counter the statistically common \"rock\" first move from new players.\n"

This suggests they might be using similar strategic thinking rather than being a purely instinctive player.\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by thinking one level ahead. Given that both players chose paper, there's a psychological tendency to assume the opponent will try to beat our previous move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze this. If they think we'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors. If they think we'll try to counter their expected scissors with rock, they might choose paper again. There's also the possibility they might choose rock thinking we'll choose scissors to beat their paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: In this situation, many players tend to shift their strategy after a tie rather than stick with the same move. There's a psychological urge to \"break\" the tie with a different choice.\n\nGame Theorist: This is becoming a classic recursive thinking problem - \"they think that we think that they think...\" We need to choose the optimal level of strategic depth.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that our opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, but facing the natural human tendency to change moves after a tie, I suggest we play scissors. This would:\n1. Beat their paper if they stick to it\n2. Tie with scissors if they try to beat our previous paper\n3.

This suggests they might be using a less conventional strategy or making more randomized choices.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their sequence so far has been paper -> rock, which is interesting. After losing a round, players often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. They might stick with their losing move out of stubbornness or disbelief\n2. They might try to beat what just beat them (in this case, paper to beat our scissors)\n\nStrategic Advisor: We've seen they're capable of surprising moves. The fact that they chose rock when we expected paper suggests they might be thinking more independently rather than following common game patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider their perspective. They lost to scissors, so they might expect us to stick with our winning move. If they think that way, they would choose rock again to beat our expected scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, the psychology of losing often prompts players to change their strategy. The emotional impact of losing makes players less likely to repeat their losing move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given all this, I recommend playing paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats rock if they're stubborn and repeat their move\n2. It ties with paper if they try to beat our previous scissors\n3. Even if we lose to scissors, we're gathering valuable information about their strategy pattern\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

The opponent's moves so far are: paper -> rock -> scissors, which appears to be rotating through all three options in a clockwise pattern if visualized on a typical RPS diagram.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a fascinating development! If they're using a rotating pattern (consciously or unconsciously), we might have uncovered their strategy. However, they've now lost twice, which could trigger a break from any pattern due to frustration or a desire to be less predictable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to consider two main possibilities:\n1. They continue the apparent rotation pattern, which would mean rock is next\n2. They break the pattern due to consecutive losses and try something completely different\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their three moves so far (paper -> rock -> scissors), there's strong evidence suggesting a clockwise rotation. If this is indeed their pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, having lost twice now, there's significant psychological pressure to change strategy. Players who realize they might be predictable often make sudden strategy shifts to regain control.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Despite the risk of them breaking their pattern, I believe our best move is to play paper for these reasons:\n1. It beats rock if they continue their observed rotation pattern\n2. If they're analyzing their losses and notice their own pattern, they might deliberately choose scissors again to try to beat our expected paper\n3. But the psychological pressure of two losses makes it less likely they'll repeat their losing move (scissors)\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value of playing paper is highest here, even considering the possibility of pattern breaks.\n\n[move] paper Anticipating either a continuation of the observed rotation pattern or a psychological break from a losing streak\n"

This breaks our rotation theory and shows they're capable of move repetition. More importantly, they just won their first round, which significantly changes the psychological dynamics.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical moment. After their first win, there are two strong psychological factors at play:\n1. Reinforcement of success: Players often stick with what just worked\n2. Confidence boost: Their first win might make them more aggressive or more willing to try new strategies\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the complete pattern. They broke their previous pattern at a crucial moment and won. This suggests they might be more strategic than we initially thought.\n\nGame Theorist: Given they just succeeded with rock, if they're using win-stay strategy, they'll play rock again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll try to counter their previous winning move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they won with rock is particularly significant. Rock is often associated with strength and stability, and after finally winning, there's a psychological comfort in sticking with this \"strong\" move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We have several options:\n1. Play paper to beat rock if they stick with their winning move\n2. Play scissors anticipating they'll switch to paper to beat our expected rock\n3. Play rock expecting they'll try to be clever and play scissors\n\nAfter careful consideration, I recommend playing scissors. Here's why:\n- If they're feeling confident from their win, they're more likely to try to outthink us rather than simply repeat their winning move\n- The psychology of winning often leads players to try to \"level up\" their strategy rather than stay defensive\n- They've shown they're capable of making unexpected choices at crucial moments\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

After their win with rock, they switched to scissors, leading to a tie. This shows they didn't stick with their winning move, suggesting they're actively trying to outthink us.\n\nPsychology Expert: A tie after their winning round is interesting. It creates a mixed emotional state - they didn't lose their momentum completely, but they didn't maintain their winning streak either. Post-tie psychology after a brief taste of victory is quite different from regular post-tie situations.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's break down what we know:\n1. They're willing to change strategies even after winning\n2. They've shown they can break patterns when needed\n3. They've used each move type at least once, showing flexibility\n4. We just had a scissors-scissors tie\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie, especially with scissors, players often lean towards rock as it feels like a \"stronger\" response to break the deadlock. However, this opponent has shown they think beyond basic tendencies.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tied scissors might create a subtle psychological aversion to using scissors again immediately. Moreover, after a tie, players often try to gain a psychological edge by attempting to counter what they think their opponent will do next.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given these factors, I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. It beats scissors if they maintain their last move\n2. More importantly, if they're thinking ahead and expecting us to play paper (to beat their expected rock), they might play scissors - which our rock would beat\n3.

This type of situation often leads to more aggressive or unpredictable play, as players may feel frustrated at losing their momentum. There's often a strong urge to \"regain control\" of the game.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's consider what we've learned:\n1. They've demonstrated sophisticated thinking\n2. They don't stick to patterns even when successful\n3. They've now lost multiple times, which may affect their strategy\n4. We're on a winning move, but they've shown they adapt after losses\n\nGame Theorist: One interesting aspect is that they haven't used the same move three times in a row at any point, suggesting they value unpredictability. However, they just lost with paper, which adds another psychological layer.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with paper, there's often a psychological aversion to using it again immediately. Combined with their previous demonstrated behavior of strategic thinking, they might be looking to make a strong statement with their next move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing scissors for these reasons:\n1.

Back-to-back scissors moves leading to a tie is significant, especially since it's the first time we've seen consecutive identical moves from them.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive scissors ties creates a unique psychological situation:\n1. There's a strong aversion to playing scissors a third time\n2. Both players know this aversion exists\n3. This creates a meta-game where each player is aware that the other is likely thinking about breaking away from scissors\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's break down the current dynamics:\n1.

We've now moved from scissors ties to a rock tie, which creates a different strategic dynamic. We've also noticed they're particularly adept at defying pattern-based predictions.\n\nPsychology Expert: A rock-rock tie after scissors-scissors creates an interesting psychological state:\n1. Rock feels more \"stable\" than scissors, which might influence staying power\n2. Both players might feel they've \"graduated\" from the scissors deadlock\n3. After multiple ties, there's increased pressure to find a winning move\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze key factors:\n1. We've moved from \"light\" (scissors) to \"heavy\" (rock) in RPS terminology\n2. They've consistently shown sophisticated thinking\n3. Multiple consecutive ties might push for more aggressive play\n4. Their most successful move historically has been rock\n\nGame Theorist: The transition from scissors to rock ties suggests they might be searching for stability. However, their history shows they're comfortable making unexpected moves to break stalemates.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a rock tie, there's often a psychological inclination to escalate to paper (as it feels like a \"smarter\" move that beats the \"brute force\" of rock). However, this opponent has repeatedly shown they think beyond such simple progressions.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing scissors for these reasons:\n1. If they follow the common psychology of playing paper to beat rock, scissors will win\n2. They've shown they like to think multiple levels ahead, so they might anticipate us playing paper to beat their rock\n3. While we risk losing to repeated rock, their pattern suggests they rarely stick with the same move after a tie\n4. The multiple recent ties likely create pressure to break the deadlock with a winning move\n\nGame Theorist: This play positions us well against their most likely sophisticated responses while acknowledging their demonstrated ability to think several moves ahead.\n\n[move] scissors Based on rock tie psychology and opponent's history of sophisticated counter-plays\n"

The number of ties suggests either excellent mutual prediction or a complex meta-game developing.\n\nPsychology Expert: This situation is psychologically intense because:\n1. We've had multiple consecutive ties\n2. We've oscillated between rock and scissors ties\n3. The repeated ties create mounting pressure to break the pattern\n4. The frequency of scissors in their play suggests they're comfortable with this move\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's break down the current dynamics:\n1.

The opponent has consistently demonstrated sophisticated thinking\n4. They've shown ability to break patterns at unexpected moments\n\nGame Theorist: Given the number of ties and the oscillation between rock and scissors, there's strong game-theoretical pressure to introduce paper as it's been absent from recent plays. However, this opponent has repeatedly shown they can think beyond obvious pattern breaks.\n\nPsychology Expert: After so many ties, especially with scissors reappearing frequently, there's typically an overwhelming urge to drastically change strategy.

They indeed went to rock as a \"stability move\" after their paper loss, but lost again. Two consecutive losses after a long tie sequence significantly changes the strategic landscape.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their current psychological state is crucial to analyze:\n1. They've lost two rounds in a row\n2. Both losses came after a long sequence of ties\n3. Their attempts to both break the tie (paper) and stabilize (rock) failed\n4. This might create either a defensive or highly aggressive mindset\n\nStrategic Advisor: Key considerations:\n1. They're on a two-loss streak\n2. Their recent moves show decreasing success\n3. The pressure to win has increased significantly\n4. Their sophisticated thinking pattern might lead to a complex response\n\nGame Theorist: After consecutive losses, especially following ties, players often exhibit one of three behaviors:\na) Return to previously successful moves\nb) Make an unexpected, high-risk choice\nc) Try to establish a new pattern entirely\n\nPsychology Expert: Double losses can trigger more extreme responses than single losses. The frustration of failing both to break the tie and then to stabilize might push them toward a more dramatic strategy shift.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1.

We're now at FIVE consecutive ties, which is statistically extraordinary and suggests either perfect strategic alignment or a deep meta-game.\n\nPsychology Expert: This situation has reached unprecedented complexity:\n1. Five consecutive ties creates immense psychological pressure\n2. The synchronization has moved beyond coincidence\n3. Both players are demonstrating exceptional strategic patience\n4. The tension between maintaining and breaking the pattern is extreme\n\nStrategic Advisor: Critical considerations:\n1. The opponent has matched every strategic adaptation\n2. The length of the tie sequence defies probability\n3. Every conventional assumption about pattern breaks has failed\n4. We're in a deep meta-game of mutual prediction\n\nGame Theorist: In this extraordinary situation, we must consider:\na) The mathematical improbability of continuing the sequence\nb) The possibility that the opponent has decoded our strategic thinking\nc) The need to break from conventional pattern-breaking strategies\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, the psychological dynamics shift from normal game theory to a test of strategic discipline. The pressure to break the pattern is now so extreme that maintaining it becomes a viable strategy precisely because it seems impossible.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. The sheer improbability of another tie suggests this is the sequence's breaking point\n2. If they expect us to continue the pattern with scissors, rock wins\n3. If they try to break the pattern with paper (expecting our rock), we only lose once but gain crucial information\n4. The meta-game has reached a point where the most unexpected move might be the most predictable one\n\nGame Theorist: After five consecutive ties, the game has transcended normal strategic considerations. Rock offers the best combination of pattern break and strategic coverage.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological threshold for maintaining synchronization has reached its limit, making this the optimal moment for a decisive pattern break.\n\n[move] rock Based on five-tie sequence psychological threshold and meta-game considerations\n"

SIX consecutive ties defies all probabilistic expectations and suggests we're engaged in a truly extraordinary meta-game.\n\nPsychology Expert: We're in uncharted psychological territory:\n1. Six consecutive ties is beyond any normal strategic framework\n2. The synchronization has become the defining feature of the game\n3. The pressure between maintaining/breaking has evolved into a higher-order game\n4. We're testing the limits of strategic patience and prediction\n\nStrategic Advisor: Critical observations:\n1. Every attempt to anticipate pattern breaks has been matched\n2. We've moved beyond conventional game theory\n3. The opponent shows remarkable ability to mirror our strategic depth\n4. The game has evolved into a pure test of meta-strategic thinking\n\nGame Theorist: At this extreme point, we must consider:\na) The sequence has become so improbable that continuing it might be the most unexpected play\nb) Traditional pattern-breaking strategies have lost meaning\nc) We're operating in a realm where standard game theory may no longer apply\n\nPsychology Expert: After six ties, the psychology shifts from pattern-breaking pressure to a test of who will maintain strategic discipline longest. The obvious urge to break the pattern has itself become predictable.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing scissors for these reasons:\n1. At this point, maintaining the pattern has become as unexpected as breaking it\n2. If they expect us to break with paper (to beat rock), scissors wins\n3.

SEVEN consecutive ties transcends all conventional game theory and suggests we're engaged in what might be termed a \"super-meta-game.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: We've entered a realm of pure strategic abstraction:\n1. Seven consecutive ties creates a psychological situation without precedent\n2. The game has evolved beyond breaking/maintaining patterns\n3. We're testing the absolute limits of strategic synchronization\n4. Normal psychological pressure points have lost meaning\n\nStrategic Advisor: Key considerations:\n1.

The opponent has demonstrated unprecedented strategic synchronization\n4. The game has become a pure test of meta-cognitive prediction\n\nGame Theorist: In this extraordinary situation:\na) The very concept of pattern-breaking has become recursive\nb) Each additional tie adds another layer of strategic complexity\nc) We're operating in a domain where probabilities have lost meaning\n\nPsychology Expert: At seven ties, we've transcended normal psychological barriers. The pressure to break the pattern has evolved into a higher-order strategic consideration where maintaining synchronization might be the ultimate meta-play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing rock for these reasons:\n1. The sheer weight of seven consecutive ties suggests that any attempt to outthink the pattern is itself predictable\n2. If they expect us to maintain the scissors pattern out of strategic discipline, rock wins\n3. We've reached a point where the simplest move might be the most sophisticated\n4.
