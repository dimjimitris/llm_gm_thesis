    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The game is essentially Rock-Paper-Scissors with points assigned. All moves have equal chances of winning or losing theoretically.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, the opponent has no pattern to analyze yet. However, studies have shown that in Rock-Paper-Scissors, \"rock\" is often a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could choose \"paper\" to counter a potential \"rock\" move. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing to \"scissors.\" The risk is balanced as all moves have the same win/loss probability of 1/-1 points.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with going with \"paper\" for the first move. It counters the psychologically common first choice of \"rock,\" and even if we lose, we'll gather information about the opponent's playing style for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Making a strategic first move, anticipating a possible \"rock\" from a fresh player.\n"

Our opponent used scissors in the first round, which was unexpected but gives us valuable information.\n\nPattern Analyst: Some players tend to stick with a winning move, so there's a chance they might use scissors again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll expect this and change their strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the scenarios:\n1. If they repeat scissors (possible due to success): We should use rock\n2. If they anticipate our adjustment and switch to paper: Rock would still win\n3. If they go to rock (to counter our potential scissors): Rock would tie\n\nGame Strategist: Based on this analysis, \"rock\" appears to be our safest play. It wins against both scissors (if they repeat) and paper (if they try to counter what they might think will be our scissors), and at worst ties against rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Rock gives us the best risk-adjusted outcome based on our current information and likely opponent psychology.\n\nPattern Analyst: Also worth noting that in Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often cycle through the options in a natural progression. After scissors, rock is a common next choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Strategic response based on opponent's previous scissors play and potential counter-strategies.\n"

Following the natural cycle of the game, there's a higher probability they might choose paper next. This is supported by two factors:\n1. Natural progression in RPS often goes scissors -> rock -> paper\n2. They might try to beat our rock from last round\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options:\n1.

Rock would be predictable after our win. Scissors provides a good balance - it beats paper if they repeat, and ties with their potential scissors play.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent's sequence also suggests they might be using a form of rotation strategy.

They've played paper in rounds 4 and 6, both times after scissors-tie rounds. This suggests a pattern: after a scissors tie, they switch to paper. They might be developing a unconscious pattern.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze the current situation:\n1. They've just lost with paper twice when we played rock\n2. Players often avoid moves that recently lost\n3. They might expect us to continue with rock after two successful uses\n\nGame Strategist: Their last two losses came from the same move combination. Psychology suggests they're unlikely to try paper a third time after losing with it twice. They might either:\na) Use scissors, returning to their most frequent move\nb) Use rock, trying to break our winning streak with rock\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent seems to be struggling with predictability. After losing twice with paper against our rock, they're most likely to avoid paper. Given their preference for scissors historically, that seems their most likely move.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a key decision point. Rock has won us two rounds but might be getting predictable.

Additionally, they might feel their scissors play is becoming too predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also a psychological element - after multiple ties, players often try to break the stalemate with a completely different move. Paper would fit this pattern and align with their historical post-scissors-tie behavior.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the strong historical pattern of them playing paper after scissors ties, and their likely desire to break the predictability of their scissors play, scissors would be our best counter.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating they will follow their consistent pattern of playing paper after a scissors tie, while also protecting against the possibility they stick with their preferred scissors play.\n"

If they follow their pattern after paper losses (scissors): Rock wins\n2. If they try rock (breaking pattern): Rock ties\n3. If they stick with paper third time: Rock loses\n\nGame Strategist: Their behavior after losses has been very consistent - they switch moves. After paper losses specifically, they've shown a clear preference for switching to scissors. Additionally, they might feel paper is \"burned\" after two consecutive uses.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their historical 60% scissors usage and their specific pattern of switching to scissors after paper losses, scissors seems highly probable. They've also never used any move three times in a row, making another paper unlikely.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock provides our best risk-adjusted outcome. It wins against their most likely move (scissors), ties against their second most likely move (rock), and only loses to paper, which they're unlikely to play a third time after two consecutive uses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch from paper (after losing with it) to their preferred scissors move, following their established pattern after paper losses.\n"
