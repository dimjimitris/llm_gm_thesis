    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. Without prior information about the opponent's tendencies, we should avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data about the opponent, we cannot identify any patterns yet. However, studies have shown that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice among players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that rock is a common first move, we could consider playing \"paper\" to counter it. However, if our opponent is also strategic, they might anticipate this and choose scissors. For the first move, we should avoid overthinking and make a solid choice that gives us information for future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's start with paper. This will help us gather information about our opponent's initial strategy while countering the most common first move (rock).\n\nPattern Analyst: Additionally, choosing paper as our first move will help us establish a baseline for analyzing future patterns in our opponent's responses.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I concur. Let's go with paper and observe the response carefully to inform our future moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Switch to another move anticipating our adjustment\n3. Given they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they might be trying to establish a pattern to trap us\n\nStrategic Advisor: Here's what we should consider:\n1. Our opponent has shown they don't follow the \"rock first\" convention\n2. They might expect us to play rock now to counter their previous scissors\n3. If they're thinking ahead, they might switch to paper anticipating our rock\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they made an unexpected first move, we should be prepared for sophisticated play. They might be trying to create a psychological advantage.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, playing rock has two advantages:\n1. It directly counters their previous move (scissors)\n2. If they're thinking multiple steps ahead and switch to paper, we can identify that pattern for future rounds\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with playing rock.

From a game theory perspective, after a tie, players often:\n1. Either stick with the same move, hoping to catch the opponent switching\n2. Or switch to beat what they think the opponent will play\nGiven that our opponent has shown strategic thinking, they're likely to switch.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to consider the psychology here:\n1. Our opponent first countered our paper with scissors (showing strategic thinking)\n2. Then matched our rock (either by coincidence or prediction)\n3. They might expect us to switch to paper to beat their expected rock\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent seems to be playing a sophisticated game. They haven't shown any predictable patterns yet, which suggests they're either very strategic or randomizing effectively.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, playing scissors would be optimal because:\n1. If they stick with rock (less likely), we lose\n2. If they switch to paper (more likely given their apparent strategy level), we win\n3. If they go to scissors, we tie\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with scissors.

Our opponent appears to be using a sophisticated counter-strategy. They've managed to either:\n1. Successfully predict our moves based on game theory principles\n2. Or they're successfully making us react in predictable ways\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to break this pattern. They seem to be outmaneuvering us by anticipating our logical responses. Instead of trying to outthink them at a higher level, we might need to introduce some unpredictability.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. So far, we've played paper->rock->scissors in that order, which could be seen as a predictable sequence. They might be expecting us to start a new sequence or try to counter their paper.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, we need to avoid being predictable. The opponent has demonstrated they can outthink our strategic approaches. Random play can be optimal against a superior pattern predictor.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I suggest we play rock.

Possibly using our own analytical approach against us\n3. Staying one step ahead even when we try to be unpredictable\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need a complete strategy reset. Our attempts at both pattern-based and anti-pattern play have been unsuccessful. Sometimes in game theory, when facing a superior opponent, the best strategy is to truly randomize.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Looking for patterns or trying to create anti-patterns isn't working. Our opponent seems to be able to predict both our strategic and counter-strategic moves.\n\nGame Theorist: Pure random strategy (1/3 probability for each move) is actually the Nash equilibrium for Rock Paper Scissors. We should have perhaps employed this earlier. When facing a superior opponent who can read our strategic intentions, randomization is optimal.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I suggest we use this moment to truly randomize. Let's play paper:\n1. It's not trying to counter their last move\n2. It's not trying to predict their next move\n3. It's simply a random choice without strategic overthinking\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

Probability in fair play would be (1/3)^22, astronomically small\n\nStrategic Advisor: For our final paper move, we can state with absolute certainty:\n1. This game is entirely deterministic due to perfect opponent information\n2. The opponent sees and counters every move we make\n3. No strategy or pattern could possibly succeed\n4. This serves as a perfect example of how information advantage breaks game balance\n\nPattern Analyst: This 23rd and final move will complete our thorough documentation of this educational case study.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper (After 22 rounds (21 losses, 1 tie, 95.5% loss rate), we complete our comprehensive analysis of how perfect opponent information in sequential play makes fair competition mathematically impossible)\n"
