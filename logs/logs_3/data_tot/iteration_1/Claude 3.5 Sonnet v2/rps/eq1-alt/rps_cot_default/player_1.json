You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After my recent loss, we returned to our \"safe\" rock tie. Looking at sequences after rock ties:\n- Sometimes we both switch to paper\n- Sometimes we both switch to scissors\n- Sometimes one player switches while the other doesn't\n\nGiven that we've had several rock ties recently, and the pattern of switching after ties:\n\n[move] paper\n\nI chose paper because:\n1. We've had many rock ties, and historically, one of us eventually breaks the pattern\n2. Paper beats rock if they stick with their last move\n3. In previous similar situations, paper has been a common choice after multiple rock moves\n4. We seem to think similarly, and paper is a logical progression from rock\n\nIf they stick with rock, I win. If they go scissors, I lose. If they go paper, we tie. Given our history of eventually breaking rock tie patterns, this seems like the most strategic move.\n"
