Since this is the first move and I have no information about opponent tendencies:\n- A random choice would be reasonable\n- Many players tend to choose rock as their first move (common human tendency)\n- Paper would beat rock if opponent follows this tendency\n\n5.

Pattern observation:\n- Opponent has played scissors twice in a row\n- They just lost with scissors\n- They've shown tendency for paired moves\n   (paper-paper, scissors-scissors)\n- But also shown ability to break patterns\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n- After losing with repeated scissors:\n   a) Likely to break scissors pattern\n   b) May feel need to be less predictable\n   c) Might be frustrated with consecutive losses\n   d) Could seek safe, fundamental play\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n- Three scissors plays would be:\n   a) Extremely predictable\n   b) Against their demonstrated intelligence\n   c) Too risky after a loss\n\n5. Risk assessment:\nMost likely scenarios:\n- Rock (safe play after scissors loss)\n- Paper (expecting my rock counter)\n- Scissors (least likely due to recent loss)\n\n6. Decision making:\n- Given their demonstrated strategic ability\n- And their recent loss with scissors\n- They're most likely to play rock because:\n   a) It's a safe, fundamental move after loss\n   b) Breaks away from failed scissors\n   c) Counters expected scissors from me\n- Therefore, paper would:\n   a) Beat expected rock play\n   b) Tie against unlikely paper\n   c) Lose only to third scissors (very unlikely)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
