    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - Specialist in analyzing patterns and player behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Expert in evaluating risk vs reward\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In Rock, Paper, Scissors, no single move dominates others - each move wins against one option and loses against another.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Without prior moves to analyze, we should consider common player psychology. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that observation, we could choose Paper to counter a potential Rock. However, we should also consider that since our opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when there's no dominant strategy and no prior information, a random selection would be optimal as it prevents being predictable. However, given the psychological insight about Rock being a common first move, I would lean towards Paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I concur with playing Paper. Even if we're wrong, this will give us valuable information about our opponent's thinking process for future rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk is manageable: -1 point if opponent plays Scissors, +1 if they play Rock, and 0 if they also choose Paper. I support the Paper strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper (Opening with Paper to counter potential Rock, while accepting the risk against Scissors)\n"

This gives us our first piece of actual data about their decision-making.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since both players chose Paper, this suggests our opponent might be using similar strategic thinking to ours. After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting their next move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that both players chose Paper, there might be a tendency for the opponent to switch to Scissors, thinking we might stick with Paper or assuming we'll predict their switch to Scissors and play Rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play Rock this time. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they expect us to stay with Paper and switch to Scissors, Rock beats their Scissors\n2. If they predict we'll switch to Scissors and play Rock themselves, we tie\n3. If they overthink and play Paper again, we lose\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychology after a tie often leads to players making a change rather than sticking with the same move. I agree with the Rock strategy - it protects against the most likely scenario of them switching to Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for Rock looks good here. Even though we could lose to Paper, protecting against Scissors while having a chance to win against it is a solid strategy at this stage.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock (Anticipating opponent might switch to Scissors after the tie, while accepting the risk of them sticking with Paper)\n"

The opponent stuck with Paper, possibly thinking we would switch to Scissors or stay with Paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: This is crucial information. Our opponent has now shown a pattern of choosing Paper twice in a row. This could indicate either:\n1. A strong preference for Paper\n2. A simple strategy of sticking to one move\n3. They might now feel compelled to change after losing\n\nRisk Manager: Two Papers in a row from them, with the second one resulting in a loss, creates significant psychological pressure for them to change their move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their consecutive Paper moves and recent loss, they're very likely to switch now. They might:\n1. Switch to Scissors thinking we'll play Paper\n2. Switch to Rock thinking we'll predict their switch to Scissors\n3. Stick to Paper, but this seems least likely after a loss\n\nPattern Analyzer: I recommend Scissors here. Here's why:\n1. If they finally switch to Rock (highly likely), we lose but it's a calculated risk\n2. If they stick to Paper (less likely but possible), we win\n3. If they choose Scissors (also possible), we tie\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with Scissors.

Let's recap the sequence:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Paper (Tie)\n- Round 2: Rock vs Paper (We won)\n- Round 3: Scissors vs Scissors (Tie)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown they're capable of changing strategies, and now we're seeing a classic RPS dynamic emerge. After matching Scissors, many players will be tempted to switch to Rock to beat the previous move.\n\nRisk Manager: There's an interesting psychological element here - both players might be thinking \"they won't expect me to stick with Scissors after a tie.\" This creates a multi-level thinking game.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation, I suggest we play Paper. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they switch to Rock (highly likely after Scissors), we win\n2. If they overthink and stay with Scissors, we lose\n3. If they triple-overthink and play Paper, we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: I concur with Paper. The sequence suggests they're becoming more strategic in their thinking, and Rock is the most logical next move for them after a Scissors tie.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward for Paper looks good here.

Started with double Paper\n2. Switched to Scissors and stuck with it for two rounds\n3. They've been punished twice for not changing their move\n\nRisk Manager: After losing with Scissors against our Paper, they're in a challenging psychological position. They've lost twice now and might be looking to break their losing streak with a more aggressive or unpredictable play.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. After losing with Scissors, they might switch to Paper to beat our potential Rock\n2. However, they might also expect us to play Paper again since it just won\n3.

They've moved from sticking with moves to making more strategic choices. The sequence of ties and their timing is particularly interesting - they're matching our moves in odd-numbered rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: After a Rock tie, traditional RPS psychology suggests many players will shift to Paper to beat an expected repeat Rock. However, this opponent has shown they can think beyond the obvious.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this opponent's pattern of adapting and occasional move-matching, I suggest Scissors. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they play the expected Paper to beat repeated Rock, we win\n2. If they try to outthink us and play Rock again, we lose\n3.

The opponent has displayed an interesting alternating pattern between matching our moves (in rounds 1, 3, and 5) and playing Paper (rounds 2 and 6). They've played Paper three times total, more than any other move.\n\nRisk Manager: This is our first loss, and psychologically, players often change their approach after a winning move. However, given their apparent comfort with Paper, they might stick with it.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with their winning Paper strategy (which they've shown preference for), we win\n2. If they switch to Scissors thinking we'll play Paper to counter their Paper, we win\n3. If they play Rock expecting us to play Scissors again, we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown a tendency to return to Paper at key moments. They've also demonstrated they're comfortable making the same move even after it's been revealed. The Rock play could capitalize on both these patterns.\n\nRisk Manager: After our first loss, we need a strong comeback play.

The opponent has played Paper four times now (rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7), showing a strong preference. However, they've just lost with it, which might finally force them to abandon this strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: They've lost twice with Paper against our Rock. Psychologically, this creates strong pressure to abandon Paper, especially after consecutive losses with it.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they finally abandon Paper (highly likely after two losses), they'll probably choose Rock as it's the most robust-feeling move\n2. If they somehow stick with Paper (seems unlikely now), we win\n3. If they try to get clever and choose Scissors, expecting us to play Paper, we tie\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological pressure of losing twice with Paper, combined with the natural tendency to choose Rock when seeking a \"safe\" option, makes Rock their most likely next move. Scissors would be risky for them as they might expect us to play Paper.\n\nRisk Manager: While Scissors could lose to Rock, it feels like the right moment to make this play.

The opponent has just made three key transitions:\n1. Finally abandoned their Paper preference\n2. Switched to Rock as predicted\n3. Lost with their new strategy\n\nRisk Manager: This is a psychologically challenging position for the opponent. They've lost after changing their primary strategy, which often leads to erratic decision-making or reverting to previous patterns.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper for this round.

They might try Scissors to beat our potential Paper play\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure is immense on them now.

The opponent has now tried all three moves in their last three turns (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) and lost with each one. They're likely feeling completely outplayed and might be questioning every strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical psychological moment. After losing three consecutive rounds with different moves, the opponent is likely to either:\n1. Play completely randomly out of frustration\n2. Try to find a pattern in our moves to counter\n3. Return to their original comfort move (Paper)\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at our recent sequence, I recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1.

Looking at the pattern, they've shown a tendency to match our moves in ties (Paper-Paper, Scissors-Scissors, Rock-Rock twice).

The Rock tie might encourage them to try to take control of the game.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper for this round. Here's why:\n1. After a Rock tie, Paper is the traditional counter-move\n2. The opponent might stick with Rock, feeling it \"worked\" by stopping their losing streak\n3.

They've shown a pattern of eventually abandoning strategies that lose, as we saw with their Paper preference earlier.\n\nRisk Manager: After losing with Rock, which they had committed to for three rounds, they're likely to feel forced to change strategy. The psychological pressure to switch is very high now.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. They're likely to finally abandon Rock after losing with it\n2. The most common move after abandoning a losing streak with one move is to switch to what would have beaten their previous move (Scissors in this case)\n3. Paper beats Rock if they stubbornly stick to it, and ties with Paper if they try to counter our expected Rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their behavior pattern shows they tend to change strategies after losses, especially after committing to one move multiple times.

This fits their pattern of occasionally matching our moves (5 ties total now).

Here's why:\n1. After previous ties, this opponent has shown a tendency to either stick with the same move or revert to comfortable moves\n2.

They've now lost twice with Rock against our Scissors, indicating they might be becoming predictable under pressure.\n\nRisk Manager: They're in a difficult position psychologically - they've lost multiple times with Rock but keep returning to it. This suggests it's their \"panic move\" when other strategies fail.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. After losing twice with Rock against Scissors, they're likely to finally abandon Rock\n2. If they do switch, they're most likely to choose Paper (to beat expected Rock) or Scissors (to counter their previous losing Rock)\n3. Paper gives us the best coverage: beats Rock if they're stubborn, ties with Paper if they try to counter Rock, and only loses to Scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their behavior at this stage of the game shows signs of deteriorating strategic thinking - reverting to Rock despite its failures suggests they're playing more reactively than strategically. A Paper play could exploit this pattern.\n\nRisk Manager: With 7 wins, 2 losses, and 5 ties, we're in a very strong position.

Their recent sequence (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) shows they're still struggling to find a working strategy. They've now lost with Scissors multiple times in recent rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: They're back in a losing position after a momentary tie. Players often become more defensive after losing the momentum from a tie-breaking moment.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. After losing with Scissors, they're likely to switch to Paper (to beat expected Rock)\n2. They might stick with Scissors out of frustration\n3. If they play Rock, we tie rather than lose\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior after losses with Scissors:\n- They rarely stick with Scissors after it loses\n- They often switch to either Paper (their historical comfort move) or Rock (their defensive move)\nRock gives us good coverage against both Scissors repetition and Paper switch.\n\nRisk Manager: With 12 wins, 2 losses, and 6 ties, we're in an extremely dominant position. Rock is a strong defensive play that protects our lead while maintaining winning opportunities.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock (Playing Rock to counter potential Paper switch or Scissors repetition, while maintaining our commanding position)\n"

Looking at their pattern after consecutive Rock ties:\n- After R19 Rock tie \u2192 they played Scissors\nThis suggests they're trying to find stability with Rock while occasionally attempting surprise moves.\n\nRisk Manager: Multiple Rock ties in recent rounds suggests they're playing more conservatively, possibly trying to stop their losing pattern with \"safe\" moves.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. They've shown increased comfort with Rock recently (two ties)\n2. After finding any success (even ties), they often stick with that move\n3. If they switch to Scissors expecting our Paper, we lose but can afford the risk\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their behavior pattern shows:\n- Growing reliance on Rock as a defensive move\n- Tendency to stick with moves that at least prevent losses\n- Less likelihood of making aggressive plays (Scissors) after finding some stability\n\nRisk Manager: With 12 wins, 2 losses, and 7 ties, we're in a position to make this aggressive play. Paper gives us the best chance to convert their defensive Rock strategy into a win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper (Playing Paper to exploit their recent Rock comfort zone, while accepting the calculated risk of them making an aggressive switch)\n"
