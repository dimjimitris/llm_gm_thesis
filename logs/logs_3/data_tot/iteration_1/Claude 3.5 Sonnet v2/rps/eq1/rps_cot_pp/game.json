Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n   - Same moves result in tie (0/0)\n\n3. Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Rock is strong against scissors but weak to paper\n   - Paper is strong against rock but weak to scissors\n   - Scissors is strong against paper but weak to rock\n\n4. In a single isolated round with no prior information:\n   - Each move has equal 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying\n   - Expected value is the same for all moves\n   - No move has inherent advantage\n\n5. In this situation, it's reasonable to choose randomly to be unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock as my opening move, as it's psychologically seen as a \"strong\" first move by many players.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Without any prior information, all three choices are equally viable:\n   - Rock (1/3 chance)\n   - Paper (1/3 chance)\n   - Scissors (1/3 chance)\n\n4. Since there's no historical data to base a decision on, I'll consider game theory:\n   - In a single round with no prior information, any choice is equally optimal\n   - No choice has an inherent advantage\n\n5. For my first move, I'll choose rock:\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I learn they might be thinking strategically\n   - This gives me information for future rounds\n\n[move] rock (Initial move to test waters and gather information about opponent's strategy)\n",
