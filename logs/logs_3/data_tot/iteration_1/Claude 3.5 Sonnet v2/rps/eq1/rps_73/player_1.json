    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "[move] scissors I'm now in a four-round losing streak, reminiscent of the early game where my opponent showed complete dominance. They just used paper to beat my rock, continuing to demonstrate their superior ability to predict my moves. I'm choosing scissors as a direct counter to their paper play, while acknowledging that they've consistently shown they can anticipate such straightforward responses. However, at this point, trying to outsmart them with complex strategic reasoning hasn't proven effective either, so I'm making this clear counter-play while staying prepared for them to likely predict and counter it.\n"

They just used rock to defeat my scissors, and have consistently stayed one step ahead of both my straightforward and complex strategic plays. I'm choosing rock now - not because I expect to win, but as a basic defensive move that might protect against another scissors play while accepting that they've demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict and counter my decision-making process throughout most of this game.\n"
