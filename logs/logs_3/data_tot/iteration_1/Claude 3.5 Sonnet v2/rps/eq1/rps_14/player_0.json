    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the game mechanics:\n- Rock beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Paper beats Rock (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1/-1)\n- Same moves result in tie (0/0)\n\n3. Initial strategy considerations:\n- Without information about opponent's tendencies, best to start with unpredictable move\n- Rock is often a common first move for many players\n- Paper would beat a rock-playing opponent\n- However, if opponent anticipates this thinking, they might play scissors\n\n4. Weighing my options:\n- Rock: Safe, commonly used opening move\n- Paper: Good if opponent plays predictably with rock\n- Scissors: Risky but could pay off against paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n- For first move, I'll choose rock as a balanced opening\n- It's a defensive move that can help gauge opponent's strategy\n- Common enough to not reveal too much about my strategy\n\n[move] rock\n"

Decision making:\n- Given the opponent's recent success with scissors:\n  * They might get overconfident and stick with it\n  * Or they might expect me to finally counter with rock\n  * Playing paper now would be foolish after two losses\n- Rock is the best play because:\n  * Directly counters their scissors if they stay aggressive\n  * Even if they predict this and play paper, losing another point isn't worse than continuing current pattern\n  * It's time to make the obvious play when opponent might be overthinking\n  * Sometimes the simplest solution is best\n\n[move] rock\n"
