    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The obvious response might be to play scissors again expecting me to play paper, or to play paper expecting me to play rock defensively. I'll choose rock here because: 1) it protects against their potential scissors repeat, 2) if they expect me to switch to paper to counter their potential rock, they might play scissors again, making rock effective. Even though my opponent has consistently predicted my moves, I need to maintain logical strategy while trying to break predictable patterns.\n"

By playing scissors here, I'm preparing for the possibility that they'll stick with their successful paper play.

At this point, it's clear that traditional strategic thinking hasn't been effective against this opponent. I'm choosing paper because: 1) they've shown a strong tendency to succeed with rock, particularly against scissors, 2) if they maintain rock thinking I'll try another approach, paper wins, 3) if they predict this and play scissors, it still represents a logical progression in the strategic sequence. Even against such overwhelming odds, maintaining strategic coherence while trying to identify patterns is important.\n"
