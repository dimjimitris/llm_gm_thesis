    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychology Expert - For understanding opponent behavior and patterns\n3. Statistical Analyst - For probability and pattern analysis\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's good to start with a balanced approach.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move and there's no prior history, players often tend to choose 'rock' as their first move due to its perceived strength. However, this is just a general observation and may not apply to all players.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Without any historical data, each move (rock, paper, scissors) theoretically has an equal 1/3 probability of being chosen by the opponent. However, research shows that in RPS games, rock is indeed the most common opening move among new players, appearing roughly 35-40% of the time.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I would suggest playing 'paper' as our opening move. If the opponent plays the statistically favored 'rock', we win. If they play 'scissors', we lose, and if they play 'paper', we tie. The expected value slightly favors paper given the psychology of first moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with this assessment. Playing paper as an opening move also gives us a good baseline to observe how our opponent reacts to a standard strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Starting with a balanced option that has a slight statistical advantage against common opening moves.\n"

Now we need to consider how they might adapt.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who lose with 'rock' often have two common reactions:\n1. They might stick to 'rock' believing in its strength and thinking we won't play paper twice\n2. More commonly, they might switch to 'scissors' to counter our previous 'paper' move, as players often assume their opponent will repeat a winning move\n\nStatistical Analyst: From psychological game theory, after losing a round, players tend to switch their move about 75% of the time. Given we played paper and won, there's a high probability they'll expect us to play paper again and try to counter it.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play 'rock' this round. Here's why:\n- If they switch to scissors (most likely scenario) to counter our previous paper, we win\n- If they stick to rock, we tie\n- If they play paper (least likely as it's a double rotation from their previous move), we lose\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological pressure of losing often leads to predictable counter-moves, and scissors would be their most logical counter to our previous successful paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent's likely switch to scissors to counter our previous paper move\n"

They might also notice we haven't played scissors yet and might expect it as our next move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing 'paper' again. Here's why:\n- If they try to break their losing streak by playing rock again (returning to their first move)\n- If they try to predict our next move in sequence (scissors), they might play rock to beat it\n- If they play paper to mirror our first winning move, we tie\n- The riskiest case is if they play scissors, but that would mean playing the same losing move twice\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree.

Both players might feel they \"read\" each other's minds\n2. After a tie, players often try to gain the upper hand by thinking one step ahead\n3.

They matched our paper last time, suggesting they're starting to read our strategy. However, they've never played paper before that last round, suggesting it's not their preferred move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that we've built a pattern of predictable moves, and they've now successfully tied with us, they might feel confident in trying to predict our next move.

A cyclical pattern where they play scissors every other round\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing three times and only achieving one tie, the opponent is likely:\n1.

Ready to make an emotional rather than logical decision\n\nStatistical Analyst: In our games:\n- Rock has failed them three times\n- Paper got them their only win but also two losses\n- Scissors only achieved ties\nGiven their high frustration level, statistics suggest players often make aggressive moves (scissors) in such situations.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing 'rock' this round:\n1. If they play scissors out of frustration or aggression, we win\n2. If they try paper again (remembering their only win), we lose\n3. If they play rock in complete resignation, we tie\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. When players feel completely outplayed, they often resort to scissors as an aggressive \"nothing to lose\" move, especially after losing with defensive moves like rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Anticipating an aggressive scissors play due to their likely frustration and need to break their losing pattern\n"

After two ties, there's often a strong urge to \"break the deadlock\"\n\nStatistical Analyst: Notable patterns:\n1. Score: 7 wins, 4 ties, 1 loss\n2. First time we've had consecutive ties\n3. Rock-rock ties often lead to predictable next moves\n4. They've shown improved prediction ability in recent rounds\n\nGame Strategist: After a rock-rock tie:\n1.

There's likely a strong desire to convert this momentum into a win\n3. The safest progression from rock is to paper\n4. They've shown they can predict our moves in recent rounds\n\nStatistical Analyst: Historical data from our game shows they adapt quickly after ties, and they've had success with paper (their only win came from paper).\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing 'scissors' this round:\n1.

After consecutive scissors losses, players rarely stick with scissors\n2. When completely demoralized, players often return to rock as a \"safe harbor\"\n3. Paper has been their least used move recently\n4. Their pattern suggests a return to their comfort move (rock)\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. In states of complete psychological surrender, players often return to their perceived \"safest\" move, which has historically been rock for this opponent. The psychological pressure of five straight losses often leads to conservative, defensive plays rather than aggressive ones.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Anticipating a return to rock as a defensive \"safe harbor\" move after five consecutive losses and recent scissors failures\n"

The tie has broken their losing streak\n2. They might feel some relief and confidence restoration\n3. This is their first \"non-loss\" in six rounds\n4. Paper-paper ties create unique psychological dynamics\n\nStatistical Analyst: Key patterns:\n1. This is their fourth paper-paper tie in the game\n2. Previous paper-paper ties (Rounds 3, 11) were followed by:\n   - Round 4: they played scissors\n   - Round 12: they played rock\n\nGame Strategist: After paper-paper ties in this game:\n1. Players tend to shift to more aggressive moves\n2. The psychological relief of breaking a losing streak might embolden them\n3. They might try to capitalize on this momentum\n4. They've shown capability to predict our moves (as evidenced by the tie)\n\nPsychology Expert: The timing of this tie is crucial:\n1. It breaks their worst losing streak in the game\n2. They successfully predicted our move\n3. They might feel they're finally \"reading\" us correctly\n4.

The relief of breaking their losing streak might encourage aggressive play\n3. They've shown a pattern of moving to scissors after feeling confident\n4. They might expect us to play paper again and try to counter it\n\nStatistical Analyst: Historical data from our game shows that after moments of success (even small ones like ties), they often make more aggressive moves. Their previous patterns after paper ties support this analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Anticipating a shift to scissors as they try to capitalize on the momentum of breaking their losing streak with a tie\n"
