    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst: Specializes in analyzing patterns and predicting behavior\n3. Risk Manager: Evaluates risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no prior history, we should consider basic game theory principles. In rock-paper-scissors, no single move dominates others, and each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing in perfectly random play.\n\nPattern Analyst: With no previous moves to analyze, we can't predict any patterns yet. The opponent might start with any move, possibly favoring rock as it's a common first choice for many players.\n\nRisk Manager: In this initial round, we should focus on managing risk rather than trying to maximize gain. Paper could be a good strategic choice because:\n1. It beats rock, which is a common opening move\n2. If we lose (to scissors), we can gather information about the opponent's strategy\n3. If it's a tie, we've learned something about the opponent's thinking\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager's assessment. Paper is a reasonable first move as rock is statistically a common opening choice in RPS games.\n\n[move] paper This is our first move against a fresh player. Rock is a common opening move, so paper gives us a good chance of winning or at least learning about our opponent's strategy.\n"

They might anticipate us thinking this and switch themselves\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, players often tend to either:\na) Stick with their move hoping the opponent will switch\nb) Switch to what would have beaten their previous move\nc) Switch to what would have lost to their previous move\n\nRisk Manager: Given that both players showed strategic thinking by choosing paper first, we're likely dealing with a thoughtful opponent. In this situation:\n1. If they stick with paper, scissors wins\n2. If they switch to rock (expecting us to play scissors), paper wins\n3. If they switch to scissors (to beat our potential paper), rock wins\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper first. They might anticipate us switching to scissors to beat their paper, which could lead them to choose rock. Therefore, I suggest we stick with paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Since they showed similar strategic thinking to us in round 1, they might overthink and switch to rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\n[move] paper The opponent showed strategic thinking similar to ours.

They successfully predicted our continuation of paper. This suggests they're thinking at least one level ahead of us. We need to adjust.\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown sophisticated play:\n1. They matched our strategic paper opening\n2. They correctly anticipated we might stick with paper\n3. They're currently at an advantage with +1 points\nThis suggests they might expect us to play rock to counter their scissors, in which case they might play paper.\n\nGame Strategist: However, the most straightforward counter to their previous scissors would be rock. If they're thinking multiple levels ahead, they might expect this and play paper. But if they're thinking even one level further, they might go back to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their demonstrated level of sophisticated play, let's take the direct approach.

This could mean:\n1. They might have expected us to overthink and not choose the obvious counter\n2. They might now be forced to switch away from scissors since it lost\n3. They might try to surprise us by using scissors a third time\n\nRisk Manager: We're now at neutral points (0) after the win. The opponent has shown they:\n- Can think strategically (first round paper)\n- Can predict our moves (second round scissors)\n- Can make stubborn plays (scissors twice)\n\nPattern Analyst: Given they lost with scissors, and they've shown the ability to adapt, they're very likely to switch. The question is: will they switch to paper (to beat our expected rock) or to rock (playing it safe)?\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've demonstrated sophisticated thinking throughout the game, they likely expect us to either:\n1.

Willingness to switch to match our move\n\nRisk Manager: After a tie with scissors, similar to our first round tie with paper, we're at a crucial decision point:\n1.

The opponent has shown they:\n- Can match our strategic thinking (multiple ties)\n- Are willing to stick with a move repeatedly\n- Might be trying to establish a pattern to break it\n\nRisk Manager: Three consecutive scissors ties creates intense pressure to switch. Basic game theory suggests:\n1. Both players know rock is the obvious counter to scissors\n2. Therefore, both might switch to paper to beat the expected rock\n3.

Round 3: Rock (win) - Scissors\n4-6: Scissors (ties) - Scissors\n7. Round 7: Scissors (loss) - Rock\n8-10: Rock (ties) - Rock\nA clear pattern emerges: they engage in long streaks of identical moves (4 scissors, now 3 rocks).\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's style is becoming clearer:\n1. They build long streaks to establish patterns\n2. They're patient in maintaining these streaks\n3. They wait for their opponent to break first\n4. Then they punish the break perfectly (as seen in scissors streak)\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n1. Still at -1 points\n2. Three consecutive rock ties\n3. Previous scissors streak broke at 4 moves\n4. We're approaching that critical number again\n\nPattern Analyst: Key insights:\n1. 7 out of 10 rounds have been ties\n2. They've matched every extended pattern we've maintained\n3. Their pattern breaks have been highly effective\n4. The similarity to the scissors streak is striking - we're at 3 rocks now, they broke scissors at 4\n\nGame Strategist: This is remarkably similar to the scissors situation:\n1. We're in an extended streak of ties\n2. The psychological pressure to switch is building\n3. They previously punished us for maintaining scissors too long\n4. However, this could also be a double-bluff, expecting us to switch now\n\n[move] paper This is a calculated risk. We've seen this pattern before - they let the streak go to 4 before punishing us with scissors. This time, we're at 3 rocks, and their historical pattern suggests they're due for a break. Rather than waiting to be punished again, we're taking the initiative to break the pattern ourselves. If they're trying to recreate their scissors-streak strategy, they'll stick with rock expecting us to maintain the streak.\n"

But maintaining paper would be a strong play for them\n\n[move] scissors With the game nearing its end and being behind one point, we need to take decisive action. They've shown strong confidence in paper plays throughout the late game. While they might expect scissors and switch to rock, we can't afford to play conservatively now. The direct counter to their successful paper strategy is our best chance to even the score. Sometimes the obvious move is the right move, especially when the opponent might overthink our desperation.\n"

Or switch to rock anticipating scissors\n\n[move] scissors In these final moments, we need to take calculated risks. They've shown a strong affinity for paper throughout the late game, often maintaining it even after losses. While they might expect scissors and switch to rock, their pattern suggests they often stick to their strategy even when it's been punished. The meta-game has reached such complexity that sometimes the straightforward play is the strongest. We'll use scissors to directly counter their potential paper continuation.\n"
