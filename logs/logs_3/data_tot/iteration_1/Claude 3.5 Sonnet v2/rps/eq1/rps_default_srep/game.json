After a rock tie, players often:\n1. Stick with rock hoping the other will switch\n2. Switch to paper to beat repeated rock\n3. Switch to scissors anticipating the other will switch to paper\n\nGiven that my opponent has consistently demonstrated strong adaptive play and good predictive abilities, and considering that we just had a defensive tie after they lost a round, they're likely to make an aggressive move here. I think they'll switch to paper, expecting me to either stick with rock or try to counter their expected scissors.\n\nI'll play scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n",
        "A rock-rock tie keeps my score at -6.\n\nRecent sequence:\n- Won with paper against rock\n- Rock-rock tie\n- They showed adaptive play after their previous loss\n\nAfter this tie, and based on patterns from earlier in the game where we've had ties, they might:\n1. Switch to paper, expecting me to stick with rock after the tie\n2. Stay with rock, thinking I'll overthink and switch\n3. Go to scissors, trying to counter my potential paper play\n\nThroughout the game, they've been particularly good at predicting and countering my moves after ties. Given this, and that they just tied with rock after losing to paper, they're likely to switch to paper here expecting me to either stick with rock or try scissors.

        "Another tie, this time with scissors-scissors. My score remains at -6.\n\nRecent sequence:\n- Won with paper against rock\n- Rock-rock tie\n- Scissors-scissors tie\n\nWe've had two consecutive ties with different moves, showing we're often thinking along similar strategic lines. After a scissors tie, and given their strong adaptive play throughout the game, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors hoping I'll switch\n2. Switch to rock to counter repeated scissors\n3. Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock defensively\n\nGiven that they've often successfully predicted my moves when I try to counter their expected play, and considering the double-tie situation, I'll play paper. While this might seem counter-intuitive, here's my reasoning:\n- They've shown they're good at predicting obvious counters\n- After double ties, players often seek to break the pattern aggressively\n- Paper would beat rock if they play defensively against scissors\n\n[move] paper\n",

My score remains at -6.\n\nRecent sequence:\n- Rock-rock tie\n- Scissors-scissors tie\n- We've mirrored each other's moves twice in a row\n\nThis double-tie situation creates an interesting dynamic. Earlier in the game, when we had consecutive ties, the subsequent moves often proved crucial. Given my opponent's demonstrated strong strategic thinking throughout the game, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors after the tie, as they've sometimes stayed with moves after ties\n2. Switch to rock expecting me to try scissors again\n3. Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock defensively\n\nSince my opponent has consistently shown good predictive abilities and often makes strong countering moves after ties, I think they're most likely to switch to rock here to counter potential continued scissors play.
