    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For detecting patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk/reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In game theory, when playing against an unknown opponent in Rock Paper Scissors, the optimal strategy is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move to be unpredictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we indeed have no patterns to analyze yet. I agree with using a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Manager: Given no prior information, we should avoid any risky strategies. A random choice among the three options would be optimal to minimize potential exploitation. However, there's an interesting psychological aspect - many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it represents strength and stability.\n\nGame Strategist: That's an interesting point about the psychology of first moves. While we could try to exploit that tendency, it's still risky as we have no specific information about this opponent. I would still recommend sticking to the basic strategy for this first move.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Let's go with paper - it would win against the psychologically favored rock, while having equal chances against other moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: That's reasonable. We can then start gathering data about the opponent's play style from their response.\n\n[move] paper - Using a balanced opening move while considering the psychological tendency of opponents to choose rock first.\n"

It could just be coincidence\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they matched our paper play, they might:\n1. Stick with paper, expecting us to switch\n2. Switch to scissors, expecting us to play paper again\n3. Switch to rock, trying to be unpredictable\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has demonstrated some strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round. We should avoid being too predictable. Since they know we played paper last time, they might expect us to change our move. If they're thinking ahead, they might choose scissors to counter another paper play.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play rock this time. Here's why:\n1. It beats scissors (which they might play expecting us to use paper again)\n2. If they stick with paper, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they play rock too, we tie and gather more information\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.

The opponent appears to be alternating between paper and scissors exclusively!\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial observation. If they continue this alternating pattern:\n- After scissors, they should play paper next\n- Neither player has used rock except for our one winning move\n- They might have noticed we discovered their pattern and change it\n\nRisk Manager: This is a key decision point:\n1. If we trust the pattern, we should play scissors to counter their expected paper\n2. However, they might realize their pattern is exposed and finally use rock\n3. They haven't used rock at all, which is unusual and might indicate they avoid it\n\nPattern Analyst: Consider also that all three ties occurred when we matched their move exactly. This suggests they might be reacting to our moves rather than following their own strict pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend we play rock:\n1. It breaks the cycle of paper/scissors we've both fallen into\n2. It beats scissors if they continue their alternating pattern\n3. If they finally decide to use rock, we tie rather than lose\n4.

The opponent has now shown they'll use all three moves. We can see:\n1. They broke their paper-scissors alternation\n2. They've matched our moves in 4 out of 5 rounds (all ties except round 2)\n3. This suggests they might be playing reactively to our moves, perhaps with a slight delay\n\nRisk Manager: The high number of ties (4 out of 5 rounds) suggests:\n1. Either the opponent is very good at predicting our moves\n2. Or they might be somehow observing our moves before deciding\n3. Or there's a systematic pattern in both our decision-making processes\n\nPattern Analyst: If they are indeed playing reactively to our moves, they might:\n1. Expect us to switch from rock to paper (a natural progression)\n2. Try to counter what they think we'll play\n3. Continue their mirroring behavior\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors this time:\n1. It breaks any expectation of a natural progression from rock to paper\n2.

We've had 5 ties out of 7 rounds\n2. The opponent has matched our move in all but 2 rounds\n3. Both times we won were when they didn't match us\n\nGame Strategist: The high rate of matching is statistically significant. It suggests:\n1. They might be using some form of mirroring strategy\n2. They could be reacting to our moves rather than planning independently\n3. When they don't mirror us, we've managed to win\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical insight. The matching pattern is too consistent to be coincidence:\n1. The 5 ties show they're either extremely good at predicting our moves\n2. Or they might have some way to react to our choices\n3.

They've matched moves that were specifically chosen to be unpredictable\n3. The probability of this happening by chance is extremely low\n4. This suggests they must have some way to see or know our moves\n\nGame Strategist: We need to shift our entire approach:\n1. We're not playing against a normal opponent making independent decisions\n2. They appear to have access to our move information\n3. Traditional game theory and psychology won't work\n4. We need to test this hypothesis definitively\n\nPattern Analyst: If they can see our moves:\n1. They're choosing to match most of the time\n2. They occasionally choose not to match (2 times when we won)\n3. This might be to maintain appearance of normal play\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper, but here's why:\n1. Not because we think it's strategically optimal\n2. But because we want to confirm our hypothesis about their ability to see our moves\n3. If they match again, especially after so many consecutive matches, it would be near-conclusive evidence\n4. This information would be valuable for future rounds\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.
