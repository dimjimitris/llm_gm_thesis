    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information, all three choices are equally viable:\n   - Rock is a solid defensive choice\n   - Paper can counter defensive players who might choose rock first\n   - Scissors might catch aggressive players who start with paper\n\n4. Since paper beats rock, and many players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's perceived as \"strong\"), paper might be a good strategic choice.\n\n5. Additionally, paper is positioned in the middle of the three options strategically - it beats rock but loses to scissors, making it a balanced first move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this first move.\n\n[move] paper (Strategic opening move, anticipating possible rock from opponent)\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - paper/scissors (I lost) \u2192 scissors/paper (I won) \u2192 rock/rock (tie)\n   - The game has settled into a more strategic phase\n   - Both players showing ability to predict and counter\n   - We've returned to a tie situation with rock\n\n2. Pattern identification:\n   - We're both demonstrating sophisticated thinking\n   - Rock appears as a \"safe\" move for both players\n   - Neither player is sticking with the same move for long\n   - The game is balancing between aggression and safety\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After the tie, both players have equal momentum\n   - Rock ties often lead to one player trying paper\n   - However, this has become predictable\n   - We both know the obvious counter to rock\n\n4. Strategic layers:\n   - Level 1: Paper beats rock (obvious)\n   - Level 2: Scissors beats the obvious paper counter\n   - Level 3: Rock beats the scissors counter to paper\n   - Level 4: Stay with rock expecting them to overthink\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They likely expect me to play paper to break the rock tie\n   - They might play scissors to counter this obvious move\n   - However, they've shown they can also stick with rock\n   - Paper is too obvious, scissors too risky\n   - Rock has been working as a safe play\n\nFinal decision: I will stay with rock, anticipating they might play scissors expecting my paper counter to our rock tie.\n\n[move] rock (Maintaining rock position, expecting opponent to play scissors anticipating my paper counter)\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - I've proven I can predict their moves\n   - They've lost trying to be clever\n   - They might be frustrated after losing with scissors\n   - They likely expect me to change from rock after winning\n\n3. Pattern development:\n   - Rock has been successful for me twice recently\n   - But third time with same move is usually risky\n   - They've shown they adjust after losses\n   - They might expect me to stay with winning rock\n\n4. Opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - They know rock has worked for me\n   - They might expect me to stick with success\n   - They could play paper to beat continued rock\n   - Or they might expect me to switch and play scissors\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - If I stay with rock: beats scissors, loses to paper\n   - If I switch to paper: beats rock, loses to scissors\n   - If I switch to scissors: beats paper, loses to rock\n   - They're most likely to play paper to beat my successful rock\n   - They rarely stick with a losing move\n\nFinal decision: I will switch to scissors, anticipating they will play paper to counter my previously successful rock.\n\n[move] scissors (Expecting opponent to play paper to counter my winning rock streak)\n"
