However, now they've lost twice to scissors in this streak, and three times to scissors overall in recent rounds. Even with their demonstrated tendency to stick with moves, this much punishment should finally trigger a switch.\n\nThe logical counter to my successful scissors would be rock, and given their previous pattern of eventually switching to counter moves that repeatedly beat them...\n\n[move] paper Expecting them to finally switch to rock to counter my successful scissors\n"

Stubbornly stick with paper (as they did in early game)\n\nGiven that they've shown more strategic adaptation in recent rounds, and they've just lost to scissors (which creates a strong psychological impetus to counter it), I think they're most likely to make the logical counter-play.\n\n[move] paper Expecting them to switch to rock to counter my successful scissors\n",
