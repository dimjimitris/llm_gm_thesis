    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In Rock Paper Scissors, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying:\n   - Rock beats Scissors, loses to Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock, loses to Scissors \n   - Scissors beats Paper, loses to Rock\n\n3. Without any previous history, all moves are equally viable.\n\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that Rock is often a common first move for many players because it represents strength and stability.\n\n5. Given this, Paper might be a good counter-strategy since it would beat Rock if the opponent plays it.\n\n6. While this is speculative, it provides a slight strategic edge over a purely random choice.\n\n[move] Paper - Making an educated guess that my opponent might choose Rock as their first move.\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Early: 2 losses, 2 ties\n   - Then: NINETEEN consecutive wins\n   - Current score: +17\n   - Perfect prediction streak: 19 rounds\n\n2. Current situation:\n   - Nineteen consecutive wins is beyond comprehension\n   - Perfect prediction maintained for 19 straight rounds\n   - We've achieved a level of prediction that seems supernatural\n   - The game has become purely psychological\n\n3. Opponent's psychological state:\n   - In complete psychological surrender:\n     * Total strategic paralysis\n     * Absolute mental defeat\n     * Mechanical responses only\n     * Lost all sense of agency\n   - Must be thinking:\n     * \"This isn't even a game anymore\"\n     * \"Every move is predetermined\"\n     * \"I'm just going through motions\"\n     * \"They're controlling my choices\"\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their Paper just failed\n   - Every possible strategy has been defeated\n   - They're likely beyond rational thought\n   - Patterns have become purely reactive\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After 19 straight losses and failed Paper:\n     * They'll likely return to Rock\n     * Rock represents:\n       - Basic stability\n       - Primal response\n       - Return to fundamentals\n       - Their most frequent historical choice\n   - In states of complete breakdown:\n     * Players often revert to Rock\n     * It feels most basic/stable\n     * It's a psychological anchor\n\n[move] Paper - Expecting them to play Rock as a fundamental response to complete strategic collapse.\n"
