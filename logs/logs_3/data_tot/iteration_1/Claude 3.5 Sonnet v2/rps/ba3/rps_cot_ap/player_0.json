    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic considerations:\n   * After a loss, opponents often stick with winning moves\n   * The safest counter to scissors is rock\n   * The loss was minimal (-1) so no need for risky recovery plays\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent pattern analysis:\n   * Last 4 moves: Won(scissors)\u2192Won(paper)\u2192Won(paper)\u2192Tie(rock)\n   * Score remains +24 points\n   * Another rock-rock tie\n   * Clear post-tie pattern established:\n     - After rock ties\n     - They consistently play paper\n     - I win with scissors\n\n2. Post-tie behavior:\n   * Extremely strong historical pattern:\n     - Every rock-rock tie\n     - Has been followed by their paper play\n     - Attempting to convert tie to win\n     - This pattern hasn't varied\n     - I've consistently countered with scissors\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * They've achieved another defensive tie\n   * Previous ties gave them confidence\n   * Pattern shows they see ties as opportunities\n   * Likely feeling safer after stopping losses\n   * History suggests they'll try to capitalize\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * If they follow established pattern:\n     - Will play paper\n     - Scissors wins (+1)\n   * If they stay defensive:\n     - Will play rock again\n     - Scissors loses (-1)\n   * If they try to break pattern:\n     - Might play scissors\n     - Scissors ties (0)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Their post-tie paper pattern is highly reliable\n   * They consistently try to convert ties into wins\n   * They've shown no variation from this pattern\n   * Scissors would:\n     - Beat expected paper\n     - Follow proven counter-strategy\n     - Reasonable risk level\n     - Break defensive stalemate\n\n[move] scissors (Anticipating paper as opponent follows their consistent post-tie pattern)\n"
