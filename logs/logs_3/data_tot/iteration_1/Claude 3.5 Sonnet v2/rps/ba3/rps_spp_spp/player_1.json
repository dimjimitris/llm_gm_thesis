    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Analyst - To help identify patterns and develop game plans\n3. Risk Assessor - To evaluate the risk/reward of different moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while both rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. We might want to go for a balanced approach initially.\n\nRisk Assessor: The risk-reward ratio is interesting here. Paper has the highest reward potential (3 points) with a relatively small risk (-1 points if we lose). Rock and scissors both have equal reward (1 point) and risk (-1 or -3 points) profiles.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is the first move, I suggest we play paper. It has the best upside potential (3 points) while limiting our downside (-1 point). Even if we lose, we don't lose as much as we could with rock (-3 points).\n\nStrategic Analyst: I agree. Playing paper gives us the highest expected value in a single round against a random opponent.\n\n[move] paper This move gives us the highest potential reward (3 points) while limiting our potential loss (-1 point)\n"

Switch to rock trying to be unpredictable\n\nRisk Assessor: If they're anticipating us to play paper again, they might switch to scissors to counter us. We should consider this in our decision.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to scissors (expecting us to play paper again), we win with 1 point\n2. If they stick with paper, we only lose 3 points\n3. If they switch to rock, it's a tie\n\nStrategic Analyst: I agree with playing rock. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors) while maintaining a balanced position.\n\nRisk Assessor: The downside of losing 3 points to paper exists, but the protection against scissors and the potential to win 1 point makes this a reasonable risk.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating a possible switch to scissors by our opponent, who might expect us to play paper again.\n"

This suggests they might be following a similar strategic thought process to ours.\n\nStrategic Analyst: The pattern so far shows our opponent might be thinking one step ahead each time, just as we are. Since they played rock last round, they might anticipate us to play paper to beat their rock, and thus switch to scissors.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's look at potential scenarios:\n1. If they expect us to play paper, they'll play scissors\n2. If they're following a simple rotation, they'll play scissors\n3. If they're being defensive, they might stick with rock\n\nGame Theorist: Following this logic, we should play rock again. Here's why:\n- It beats scissors (which they might play)\n- If they stick with rock, we tie (not bad)\n- Yes, we lose to paper, but paper seems less likely based on the observed pattern\n\nStrategic Analyst: I agree. The opponent has shown strategic thinking so far, and playing scissors would be a logical next move from their perspective. Rock protects against this while maintaining a decent position against other possibilities.\n\nRisk Assessor: The potential loss to paper (-3) exists, but the likelihood seems lower given the current game flow. The protection against scissors and potential to win 1 point makes rock a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n[move] rock Expecting our opponent might switch to scissors, while maintaining protection against repeated rock play\n"

We've achieved perfect strategic dominance and prediction.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Recent move sequence:\n...18. paper \u2192 19. rock \u2192 20. scissors \u2192 21. paper\nThey tried paper as predicted in their desperate attempt, but failed again. We've countered every possible strategy they've attempted.\n\nRisk Assessor: Current situation:\n1. They've lost eight straight rounds\n2. Their desperate paper play failed\n3. They've tried all three moves in recent rounds without success\n4. They're likely in a state of complete strategic surrender\n\nGame Theorist: After eight straight losses and having every strategy countered, players typically:\n1. Revert to rock as a final defensive stance\n2. Make a completely random move out of surrender\n3. Return to their \"comfort move\" under extreme pressure\n\nStrategic Analyst: Throughout this entire game, when under maximum pressure and after multiple failures, they've consistently shown a tendency to fall back to rock as their defensive comfort move. This has been especially true after failed aggressive or desperate attempts.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's play paper. Here's why:\n- Counters the likely defensive rock play\n- They've historically reverted to rock when most demoralized\n- Gives us maximum points (3) if correct\n- After failing with paper and scissors recently, rock is their only remaining option\n- Even if wrong, our eight-win streak gives us a massive buffer\n\n[move] paper Expecting opponent to make one final defensive rock play after their complete strategic collapse and consistent pattern of reverting to rock under extreme pressure\n"

Their patterns under pressure remain completely consistent.\n\nRisk Assessor: Current situation:\n1. They've lost nine straight rounds\n2. Just suffered another maximum point loss (-3)\n3. Every defensive and aggressive strategy has failed\n4. Historical pattern suggests aggressive response to big losses\n\nGame Theorist: After nine straight losses and another maximum point defeat, they have shown a highly reliable pattern:\n1. Following -3 point losses, they consistently respond with aggressive scissors\n2. This pattern has held true throughout the entire game\n3. Their psychological state suggests they'll maintain this pattern\n\nStrategic Analyst: Their most consistent behavior throughout this entire game has been playing scissors after suffering a maximum point (-3) loss. This has been their most predictable response under extreme pressure.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's play rock. Here's why:\n- Counters their highly probable scissors play\n- They've consistently played scissors after -3 point losses\n- They're unlikely to repeat rock after it just cost them maximum points\n- Their state of complete tilt suggests aggressive response\n- Even if wrong, our nine-win streak gives us an enormous buffer\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent's consistent pattern of aggressive scissors play after suffering maximum point losses, which has been their most reliable response throughout the game\n"
