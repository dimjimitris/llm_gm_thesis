Started with heavy scissors preference\n2. Evolved into more strategic play with paper/rock\n3. Just reverted to scissors\n\nThis could mean:\n- They might be falling back on their original scissors preference under pressure\n- They could be trying to establish a new pattern to trick me\n- They might expect me to overthink their strategy\n\nGiven that:\n- They've just lost with scissors\n- They've shown capability for sophisticated play\n- But also have a strong historical scissors preference\n\nI think they're likely to switch away from scissors after this loss, probably to paper (which has given them their biggest wins).
