Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. This is a new game against a fresh player, so I have no prior history to base decisions on.\n\n2. Analyzing the point system:\n   * Paper beating rock gives highest points (+3)\n   * Rock beating scissors gives lower points (+1)\n   * Scissors beating paper gives lower points (+1)\n   * Losses result in corresponding negative points\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   * Paper has highest reward potential (+3)\n   * But scissors could counter paper giving me -1\n   * Rock is safer with lower point swings\n\n4. For first move against unknown opponent:\n   * Paper offers highest potential gain\n   * Even if countered by scissors, the loss (-1) is manageable\n   * Worth the risk for potential +3 gain\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   * Choose aggressive high-reward strategy to start\n   * Test opponent's approach\n   * Can adjust strategy based on their response\n\n[move] paper\n",

Analyzing the risks and rewards:\n   * Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3)\n   * Rock and Scissors have lower stakes with +1/-1 outcomes\n\n4. For a first move with no information:\n   * Playing Paper is high-risk/high-reward\n   * Rock or Scissors are safer options with less downside\n\n5. Since this is the first move, I'll take a balanced approach:\n   * I'll choose Rock as it can give me protection against Scissors\n   * If opponent plays Paper, my loss is bigger but they might be cautious too\n\n[move] rock\n",
