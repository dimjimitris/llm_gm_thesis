    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without prior knowledge of opponent's behavior, I should consider:\n   - Paper has potential for highest reward (3 points)\n   - Paper's risk is relatively low (-1 if beaten by scissors)\n   - Rock and scissors both have lower reward potential (1 point)\n   - Rock has highest risk (-3 if beaten by paper)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper offers best risk/reward ratio\n   - High potential gain (3)\n   - Moderate potential loss (-1)\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as it offers the best balance of potential reward versus risk in this initial round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Psychological assessment:\n   - Opponent is likely in a highly negative mindset (5 straight losses)\n   - They might be becoming predictable due to frustration\n   - They might make a desperate move to break pattern\n   - After scissors loss, they have two main psychological options:\n     * Make a \"safe\" play to stop losing\n     * Make an aggressive play to try to win big\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their cyclical pattern suggests paper would come next\n   - However, pattern-following has led to their losses\n   - They've just lost to rock with scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock again after success\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they make a \"safe\" play with rock, paper wins (+3)\n   - If they try to counter expected rock with paper, scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they repeat scissors (unlikely), rock wins (+1)\n   - Given their likely desperation, they might go for paper to try for highest points (+3)\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. This anticipates them either following their pattern to paper or making an aggressive paper play to try to score big points against expected rock. While rock has worked twice recently, continuing with it becomes predictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Analyzing recent sequence:\n   - Last six rounds (all wins):\n     * scissors vs paper (won +1)\n     * paper vs rock (won +3)\n     * rock vs scissors (won +1)\n     * scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - I'm on an extraordinary six-win streak\n   - Perfect read of their moves lately\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n2. Psychological analysis:\n   - They've lost six straight rounds\n   - Maximum frustration and likely tilting\n   - Every strategy they've tried has failed\n   - They might make a completely irrational move\n   - Or they might try to simplify and reset mentally\n\n3. Pattern assessment:\n   - They've tried all moves recently and lost with each\n   - Paper has lost twice to scissors\n   - Rock has lost to paper\n   - Scissors has lost to rock\n   - No move has worked for them\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After repeated losses, players often:\n     * Resort to rock as a \"reset\" move\n     * Make completely random choices\n     * Try to break obvious patterns\n   - Given their total frustration, they're most likely to:\n     * Return to rock as a basic, simple choice\n     * Try to stabilize their game\n     * Avoid paper after just losing with it\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. At this point of extreme frustration, players often return to rock as a \"reset\" button - it's psychologically seen as the most basic, stable move. While they might try scissors to counter this prediction, their current mental state suggests they're more likely to attempt to stabilize their game with a fundamental move like rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"
