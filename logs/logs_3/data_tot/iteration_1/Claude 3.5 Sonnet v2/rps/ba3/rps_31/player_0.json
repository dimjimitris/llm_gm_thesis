    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Data Analyst - For tracking patterns and analyzing payoff structures\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while having a relatively low penalty (-1) when losing to scissors. This asymmetric payoff structure is interesting.\n\nRisk Manager: True, but we're playing against a fresh player with no history. In such scenarios, it's generally good to start with a balanced approach that doesn't expose us to the highest possible penalty (-3 from playing scissors and losing to paper).\n\nData Analyst: The payoff structure shows:\n- Paper: Can win 3, lose 1\n- Rock: Can win 1, lose 3\n- Scissors: Can win 1, lose 1\nPaper has the best risk-reward ratio with potential for highest gain while not risking the highest loss.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. For an opening move against a fresh player, paper offers the best combination of potential reward while limiting our downside. The worst case is losing 1 point to scissors, while we could gain 3 points if they play rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Playing paper as it offers the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move, with potential for highest gain (3 points) while limiting potential loss (-1 points).\n"

            "text": "Starting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting. Our opponent chose scissors in the first round, which countered our paper strategy. They might be an aggressive player, or they might have also analyzed the payoff structure similarly to us but chose to counter the optimal first move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they showed willingness to play scissors, they might stick to it expecting us to play paper again. However, they might also anticipate us switching to rock to counter their previous scissors move.\n\nData Analyst: Let's look at the situation:\n1. If they play scissors again and we play rock, we win 1 point\n2. If they anticipate our rock and play paper, we lose 3 points\n3. If they mix it up completely and play rock, our rock would tie\n\nGame Strategist: This is a classic game theory scenario. They've shown they're willing to make an aggressive move. The safest play that also has winning potential would be rock - it beats their previous move if they repeat it, and at worst ties with rock.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. While rock exposes us to the highest potential loss (-3), it's a calculated risk worth taking here. It beats scissors which they've shown willingness to play, and if they switch to paper thinking we'll play scissors, they're making a very aggressive play themselves.\n\nData Analyst: Rock also gives us good information for future rounds - if they beat our rock with paper, we'll know they're likely thinking multiple steps ahead. If they play scissors again and lose to our rock, we'll know they might be pattern players.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Our opponent showed willingness to play aggressively with scissors.

They might finally abandon scissors after losing with it\n2. They might expect us to think they'll change and stick to scissors again\n3. They could anticipate our analysis and play paper to beat an expected rock\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown persistence with scissors despite losing. This could indicate either:\na) A predetermined strategy\nb) Limited strategic adaptation\nc) Or they could be setting up a trap, expecting us to play rock again\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've stuck to scissors even after losing, there's a good chance they might finally switch to counter our rock. Paper would be their optimal counter to our previous move. Playing scissors ourselves would be a good counter to their potential paper play.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Playing scissors here has a balanced risk profile:\n- If they finally play paper, we win 1 point\n- If they stick to scissors again, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If they play rock, we only lose 1 point\n\nData Analyst: The scissors play also continues our information gathering.

If they're using a \"counter the previous move\" strategy:\n- We just played scissors\n- They might play rock to beat scissors\n- Therefore, paper would be our optimal counter to their expected rock\n\nRisk Manager: The paper play here has a strong risk-reward profile:\n- If they play rock as we expect: we win 3 points\n- If they play scissors: we lose only 1 point\n- If they play paper: it's a tie (0 points)\n\nData Analyst: This also continues our information gathering. If they do play rock, it will strongly confirm our theory about their strategy of countering the previous move. This would be invaluable for future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: The potential 3-point gain with paper is particularly attractive here because we've already accumulated positive points (+1+1=2 points), so we can afford to take this calculated risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper We predict they'll play rock to counter our previous scissors move, making paper our optimal choice for potentially high reward while maintaining acceptable risk.\n"
