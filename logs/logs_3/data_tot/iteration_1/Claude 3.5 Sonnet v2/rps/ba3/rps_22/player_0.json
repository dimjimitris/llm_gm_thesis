    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavior Analyst - To understand opponent patterns and psychology\n3. Risk Manager - To evaluate risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), while rock and scissors only give 1 point. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points). Since we're playing against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy.\n\nBehavior Analyst: With a fresh player, they might default to rock as it's a common first move for many players. People often perceive rock as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the asymmetric payoffs, if we guess wrong with paper, we lose 3 points, while other moves only risk 1 point. However, if we get it right with paper, we gain 3 points. Since we have no historical data, we should consider a balanced approach.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing paper. While it's riskier, it has the highest potential payoff, and if our behavior analysis is correct about new players often choosing rock, it's our best option.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the risk, especially in a one-off situation with no prior information.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the highest potential reward while countering the common opening move of rock.\n"

They're also using a strategic approach focused on maximum potential gain\n2. They might stick with paper since it resulted in a tie\n3. They might expect us to change our move and plan accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n- If they stick with paper, scissors would give us 1 point\n- If they switch to rock (expecting our scissors), we'd lose 1 point with scissors\n- If they switch to scissors (expecting our paper), we'd lose 1 point with paper\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper in the first round, we should be cautious about being too predictable. The safest maximum loss is -1 point (with rock or scissors) compared to -3 with paper.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, scissors might be our best move because:\n1. It beats paper if they stick to their previous move\n2. It has a smaller potential loss (-1) compared to paper (-3)\n3. Even if we guess wrong and they play rock, we only lose 1 point\n\nBehavior Analyst: Agreed. Players who choose paper in their first move often show a preference for high-risk, high-reward strategies. They might stick to paper hoping to score 3 points.\n\n[move] scissors Based on the opponent's paper play in the first round and the lower risk profile of scissors compared to paper, we'll attempt to counter a potential paper repeat while limiting our downside.\n"

We've seen them use both paper and rock\n2. They successfully countered our attempt to exploit their previous move\n3. They might be employing a counter-strategy approach\n\nRisk Manager: Our current total is -1 points. We need to be strategic but also consider damage control. They've demonstrated sophisticated play by:\n- Opening with the high-risk paper move\n- Switching to rock when we tried scissors\nThis suggests they're a thoughtful player who's reading our moves well.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their shown adaptability, they might expect us to play paper to beat their rock. However, this leaves us vulnerable to a -1 loss if they play scissors, or a -3 loss if they stick with rock.\n\nBehavior Analyst: The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us. In such cases, sometimes the best strategy is to be unpredictable. Since they've shown paper and rock, they might complete the cycle with scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock would be our safest play here:\n- Beats scissors if they complete the cycle\n- Only risks -3 against paper\n- Ties against rock\nGiven their demonstrated strategic thinking, they're less likely to go back to paper as it would be too obvious.\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's demonstrated strategic adaptation and the probability they'll complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle with scissors, while also protecting against another rock play.\n"

However, there are two important considerations:\n1. They've lost three rounds in a row\n2. We've successfully predicted their last three moves\nThis might finally push them to break their pattern.\n\nBehavior Analyst: The psychology here is interesting. Three consecutive losses, especially the last one being a major -3 loss, creates enormous pressure to change strategy. This might be the round where they finally break their pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: However, some players become even more committed to their pattern when losing, believing that it will eventually work. There's also the possibility that this is an automated player programmed to follow this specific sequence.\n\nRisk Manager: Given our strong position at +5 points, we can afford to be conservative.
