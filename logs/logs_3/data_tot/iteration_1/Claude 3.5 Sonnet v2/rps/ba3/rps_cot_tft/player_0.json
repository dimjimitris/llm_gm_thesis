    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points)\n   - But paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Rock and scissors have more balanced risk/reward profiles (\u00b11 point)\n\n4. First move strategy:\n   - Without knowledge of opponent's tendencies, I'll aim for the highest potential reward\n   - The upside of paper (3 points) outweighs its downside risk in this first move\n   - People often choose rock as first move (as it feels \"strong\"), making paper potentially advantageous\n\n[move] paper\n"

Strategic options:\n   - If they stick to scissors, rock would be optimal\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating rock, scissors would be optimal\n   - If they switch to rock expecting my scissors, paper would be optimal\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Already lost 1 point, should be more conservative\n   - Rock is the safest play here:\n     * Beats scissors if they repeat\n     * Ties rock if they play defensively\n     * Only vulnerable to paper, which seems less likely given their aggressive first move\n\n[move] rock Since they showed aggressive play with scissors last round, rock provides good defense while maintaining winning potential.\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - After losing to paper with rock, they will:\n   a) Play scissors to counter paper (following their fixed pattern)\n   b) This is 100% certain given their unchanging behavior\n   c) Pattern has been consistent for entire winning streak\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - With +27 points, continue exploiting their pattern\n   - Their scissors response is guaranteed\n   - Rock would be the perfect counter to their scissors\n   - Continue perfect prediction streak\n\n[move] rock Their response is now entirely predictable. After losing to paper, they will definitely play scissors, making rock the optimal choice to continue our domination.\n"
