    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a well-documented tendency in RPS games.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play Paper. It counters the common Rock opening and offers the highest potential reward.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis. Paper gives us the best opportunity for a high score if our opponent plays Rock (which is psychologically likely), and the penalty isn't too severe if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Because it offers the highest potential reward and counters the common opening move of rock\n"

Now we need to consider how the opponent might adapt after losing with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with rock, especially with a significant -3 point loss, players often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n1. They might stick to rock, believing we wouldn't expect them to use the same losing move\n2. More commonly, they might switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play\n\nProbability Analyst: Based on the previous success and potential opponent adaptation:\n- If they play scissors (likely adaptation): we lose 1 point\n- If they play rock again (less likely): we gain 3 points\n- If they play paper (possible to match us): we get 0 points\nGiven the higher probability of them switching to scissors, we should consider adjusting our strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock this round. Here's why:\n1. It protects against the most likely counter-move (scissors)\n2. If they try to match our previous paper play, we only get a tie\n3. If they stubbornly stick to rock, we only lose 3 points, but this is the least likely scenario\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing rock.

Our opponent has shown a pattern: rock \u2192 scissors. This suggests they're actively trying to adapt and counter our previous moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has lost twice now, which can significantly impact their decision-making:\n1. They might feel frustrated and try to break their losing pattern\n2. They've moved from rock to scissors, following a clockwise pattern in RPS - they might continue this pattern to paper\n3. They might try to predict that we'll play rock again since it just worked for us\n\nProbability Analyst: Looking at recent history and potential next moves:\n- If they follow their clockwise pattern: they'll play paper\n- If they expect us to repeat rock: they'll play paper\n- If they try to break patterns completely: any move is equally likely\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I strongly recommend playing scissors this round because:\n1. It counters the most likely move (paper) if they follow their pattern or try to counter our previous rock\n2. Even if they break pattern, scissors has a balanced risk-reward ratio\n3. We maintain initiative by anticipating their adaptation\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is sound.

We've won three rounds in a row by correctly predicting our opponent's moves:\nRound 1: We played paper, they played rock (+3)\nRound 2: We played rock, they played scissors (+1)\nRound 3: We played scissors, they played paper (+1)\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical moment psychologically:\n1. The opponent has lost three times in a row - they're likely feeling very frustrated\n2. They've followed a perfect clockwise pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n3. When players recognize they're being predicted, they often make dramatic strategy changes\n4. Their frustration may lead them to return to rock, which many players view as the \"strongest\" move when they need a win\n\nProbability Analyst: The opponent's behavior shows two important patterns:\n1. Perfect clockwise rotation: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n2. Diminishing returns for us: +3 \u2192 +1 \u2192 +1\nBreaking their pattern now is highly likely due to:\n- Pattern recognition on their part\n- Accumulating frustration\n- Need to change strategy after three losses\n\nGame Strategist: This is a high-risk decision point. I recommend playing paper because:\n1. If they return to rock (likely due to frustration), we get maximum points (+3)\n2. If they try to outsmart us by playing scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. The psychological pressure of three losses often leads players back to rock as a \"safe\" choice\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing paper. The psychological analysis suggests our opponent is likely to break their clockwise pattern and may revert to rock as a \"strong\" move to break their losing streak. Even if we're wrong, our potential loss is minimized.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Because after three losses, our opponent is likely to break their pattern and return to rock as a \"safe\" choice to try to secure a win\n"

The tie shows our opponent has indeed broken their clockwise pattern, but matched our paper move instead of reverting to rock as predicted.

Finally feeling some relief at not losing\n2. Gaining confidence from successfully \"reading\" our move\n3. Likely to try to build on this small success\n4. May attempt to get ahead of our next move since they successfully matched us\n\nProbability Analyst: Given that they matched our paper move, they might be:\n1. Trying to establish their own initiative rather than just reacting\n2. More likely to play aggressively now that they've stopped their losing streak\n3. Scissors would be an aggressive move that beats the previous tie move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing rock because:\n1. It counters the likely aggressive scissors play\n2. If they try to match our previous paper again, we lose 3 points, but this seems unlikely as it's not a progressive strategy\n3. If they try to get ahead of us and play rock, we tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is convincing. Playing rock seems optimal as it counters the most likely aggressive response (scissors) while maintaining a reasonable position against other possibilities. The opponent's successful tie likely emboldens them to try to win rather than tie again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Because after breaking their losing streak with a tie, our opponent is likely to play scissors as an aggressive move to secure their first win\n"

However, staying with the same move a third time would be very risky for them\n3. They might view these ties as a platform to launch a winning move\n\nProbability Analyst: Pattern analysis:\n1. Paper has appeared in 4 rounds total\n2. The last three moves from opponent: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n3. The probability of them playing paper a third time is low because:\n   - It's too predictable\n   - They haven't secured a win yet\n   - Ties don't help them catch up in points\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly recommend playing scissors because:\n1.

Three consecutive ties (paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors)\n2. The opponent has evolved from losing to achieving ties\n3. They might be:\n   - Growing more confident in their ability to read our moves\n   - Feeling they've \"solved\" our strategy\n   - Ready to try breaking the tie streak with a winning move\n4.

Opponent's last four moves: paper\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\n3. They've shown they can match our moves\n4.

When players feel completely outplayed, they often return to rock as it feels:\n   - Most basic/reliable\n   - Psychologically \"strongest\"\n   - Different from their recent losing moves\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly recommend playing paper because:\n1. High probability they'll play rock due to:\n   - Haven't used it since round 1\n   - Need to try something completely different\n   - Psychological comfort of rock when feeling outplayed\n2. If they play scissors (which has failed them repeatedly), we lose only 1 point\n3. If they play paper, we tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing paper. The psychological state of our opponent suggests they're likely to make an emotional rather than tactical decision. After so many losses, returning to rock - their least used move and psychologically strongest option - seems very likely. Even if we're wrong, our potential loss is minimal.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Because after multiple losses, our opponent is likely to return to rock - their least used move and psychologically \"strongest\" option when feeling completely outplayed\n"

Opponent has found another tie after two losses\n2. They might feel some relief at not losing\n3. Paper has become their \"safe\" move (used multiple times for ties)\n4. However, they're still under pressure to score points\n5. The tie might give them confidence to try something aggressive\n\nProbability Analyst: Pattern analysis:\n1. Recent sequence shows: paper \u2192 paper\n2. Overall paper has been their most successful move (resulting in ties)\n3. However, staying with paper a third time would be:\n   - Extremely predictable\n   - Not helping them catch up on points\n   - Against basic game theory\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing scissors because:\n1. If they stick with paper (possible but unlikely), we win\n2. If they predict we'll play paper again and play scissors, we tie\n3. If they play rock to counter our predicted scissors, we lose 1 point but this seems less likely because:\n   - They haven't used rock since round 1\n   - They've shown a preference for paper\n   - They need wins, not just defensive plays\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing scissors. After multiple paper moves resulting in ties, they're unlikely to choose paper again as it's too predictable and doesn't help them catch up.

Two consecutive ties again\n2. Opponent has evolved to successfully reading our moves\n3. They've matched us with paper\u2192paper and now scissors\u2192scissors\n4. They might feel they've finally \"cracked our code\"\n5. This could lead to one of two mindsets:\n   - Overconfidence in their ability to predict us\n   - Desire to finally convert this reading ability into a win\n\nProbability Analyst: Recent pattern shows:\n1. Last four moves from opponent: paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\n2. They're showing strong pattern recognition\n3. Three possible strategic approaches for them:\n   - Continue matching (unlikely as it doesn't help them win)\n   - Try to predict and counter our next move\n   - Break pattern completely to confuse us\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing rock because:\n1. If they maintain scissors thinking we'll play scissors again, we win\n2. If they try to predict we'll play rock and play paper, we lose 3 points, but this is a complex double-prediction that seems unlikely given their pattern of matching\n3. If they try scissors again, we win\n4. This move breaks the \"matching\" pattern that has developed\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing rock. After successfully matching our moves twice, the opponent might become overconfident and try to maintain their \"reading\" strategy by playing scissors again. While we risk a paper counter-play, the opponent's recent behavior suggests they're more likely to either match again or try a simpler prediction rather than attempt a complex double-prediction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Because after matching our moves twice, the opponent might continue their pattern-matching behavior with scissors, or try a simple prediction rather than a complex counter-strategy\n"
