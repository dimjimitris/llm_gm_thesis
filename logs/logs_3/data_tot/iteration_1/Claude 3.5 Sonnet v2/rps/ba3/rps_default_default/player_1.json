The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests my opponent and I are operating on very similar levels of strategic thinking. After four ties, there's an even stronger psychological pressure to break the pattern, but also uncertainty about how to do it. The obvious move would be paper to beat our mutual rock play, but this opponent has consistently shown they can think multiple steps ahead. Since they're likely expecting me to make this paper play to break the tie streak, they might choose scissors.

They've now shown scissors loss after our series of ties, and throughout the game, they've typically switched moves after losses.

They've now had success with paper, and in previous patterns, they sometimes stick with successful moves while other times switch quickly. After their strong paper play, they might expect me to counter with scissors, leading them to switch to rock. However, given their previous success in predicting my moves after they win, they might anticipate this thinking and stick with paper, expecting me to overthink again. I'll choose scissors - if they maintain paper thinking I'll choose rock again, I'll win, and if they switch to rock expecting scissors, I risk a small loss rather than a large one.\n\n[move] scissors Taking a calculated risk with scissors, anticipating they might stick with their successful paper\n"
