    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Evaluating the risks and rewards:\n   - Rock: Can win 1 point or lose 3 points\n   - Paper: Can win 3 points or lose 1 point\n   - Scissors: Can win 1 point or lose 1 point\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   - Scissors has the most balanced risk/reward (-1/+1)\n   - Rock has high risk of big loss (-3) with small potential gain (+1)\n\n5. For a first move without knowing opponent's strategy, I should:\n   - Choose an option with good upside potential\n   - Avoid options with catastrophic downsides\n   - Paper offers the best upside (3 points) with moderate downside (-1)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Considering the payoff structure:\n   - If they stick with scissors and I play rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper and I play rock, I lose 3 points\n   - The rock play has high risk but could counter their previous strategy\n\n5.

Complete history with breakthrough:\n   - Previous rounds: All losses/tie (-13 points)\n   - Last round: FIRST WIN with scissors vs rock (+1)\n   - Total: -12 points\n   - This is a significant change in pattern!\n\n2. Analyzing this sudden success:\n   - First win after 10 rounds of losses/ties\n   - Came when I was most resigned to defeat\n   - Happened with a balanced risk-reward play\n   - Opponent might have finally failed to predict my move\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - Opponent might be:\n     * Surprised by their first loss\n     * Expecting me to feel confident and repeat scissors\n     * Planning to counter my potential newfound confidence\n   - I might be tempted to:\n     * Repeat the winning move (likely predictable)\n     * Get overconfident from one win\n     * Overthink this new development\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Could repeat scissors (probably too obvious)\n   - Could play paper to beat expected rock\n   - Could play rock anticipating their counter to scissors\n\n5. Final decision:\n   - The opponent will likely expect me to repeat scissors\n   - They might play rock again to crush new confidence\n   - Paper would beat their rock if they repeat\n   - Paper also has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if they predict this, the loss is only -1\n\n[move] paper\n"

Remarkable winning streak:\n   - Won scissors vs rock (+1)\n   - Won rock vs paper (+3)\n   - Won paper vs scissors (+1)\n   - Won scissors vs rock (+1)\n   - FOUR consecutive wins!\n   - Complete turnaround from early game\n\n2. Success pattern analysis:\n   - Simple, natural progression working perfectly\n   - Following basic RPS sequence\n   - Not overthinking moves\n   - Opponent seems unable to counter\n   - Strategy is clear and effective\n\n3. Psychological momentum:\n   - I have maximum confidence\n   - Opponent likely:\n     * Highly frustrated\n     * Desperate to break streak\n     * Might make emotional decisions\n     * Could revert to earlier successful strategy\n\n4. Risk consideration:\n   - Winning streak can't last forever\n   - But changing working strategy would be mistake\n   - Opponent must adapt eventually\n   - But they're currently off-balance\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Stay with proven approach\n   - Continue natural sequence:\n     * Last move was scissors\n     * Natural progression is rock\n     * Keep it simple\n     * Maintain momentum\n   - Choose rock:\n     * Follows winning pattern\n     * Maintains straightforward strategy\n     * Shows confidence in approach\n     * Forces opponent to adapt to me\n\n[move] rock\n"
