You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n3. If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nWhile this move has risk of a larger loss, it also provides reasonable defensive coverage and potential for gain. As this is the first move against a fresh player, I'm taking a balanced approach to gather information about their strategy.\n",
        "Let me think about my first move strategically. Given the payoff structure:\n- Rock vs Paper: High stakes (+/-3 points)\n- Paper vs Scissors and Scissors vs Rock: Lower stakes (+/-1 points)\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll start with a balanced option. Rock has the potential for the highest gain (3 points against paper) but also risks the highest loss. Paper is involved in both high-stakes outcomes. Scissors appears to have the most moderate risk/reward profile.\n\n[move] scissors Starting with scissors as it has moderate risk/reward and could be effective against a player who might choose paper as an opening move\n",
        "Let me think through this strategically for my first move:\n\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n- Equal moves result in 0 points\n\nSince this is a fresh game with no prior history, I'll make a move based on the potential payoffs. Rock has the highest potential payoff (3 points) if it wins, though it can lose to scissors (-1 point). Paper can win 1 point but lose 3. Scissors can win 1 but lose 1.\n\nGiven these payoffs, I'll choose rock since it has the highest potential upside.\n\n[move] rock I'm choosing rock for its potential high payoff of 3 points if successful\n",
        "Let me think about my first move strategically. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs Paper: Winner gets 3 points (high reward)\n- Paper vs Scissors & Scissors vs Rock: Winner gets 1 point (lower reward)\n\nSince this is a first move against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll go with paper. Paper gives me the potential for the highest gain (3 points if opponent plays rock), while risking a smaller loss (-1 if opponent plays scissors).\n\n[move] paper\n",

Rock has the highest potential gain but also highest risk. Paper can win big against rock but is vulnerable to scissors. Scissors has lower stakes overall.\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as my opening move since it has potential for high reward while being able to minimize losses against scissors.\n"

        "Interesting outcome - I lost with rock against paper, costing me -3 points.\n\nFor this next round, I need to consider that my opponent has shown willingness to play paper. They might:\n1. Stick with paper since it worked\n2. Anticipate me switching to paper and play scissors\n3. Mix it up completely\n\nGiven they won with paper, there's a decent chance they might stick with it or anticipate me countering with paper. \n\n[move] scissors I'm choosing scissors because it would beat paper if they repeat their move, and if they try to counter my previous rock move with paper again, I'll win. Even if they play rock, my loss would only be -1 points.\n",
