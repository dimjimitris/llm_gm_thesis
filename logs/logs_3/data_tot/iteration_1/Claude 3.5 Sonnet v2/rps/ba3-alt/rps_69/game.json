Psychological assessment:\n   - After a tie, players often:\n     * Change their move to break deadlock\n     * Try to predict opponent's change\n     * Sometimes stubbornly repeat same move\n   - The opponent might expect me to:\n     * Switch to scissors to beat repeated paper\n     * Play rock thinking they'll switch\n     * Stick with paper hoping for another tie\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock\n   - If they expect rock from me, they might play paper\n   - If they stick with paper, scissors would win\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given recent improvement in results\n   - And the tendency to change after a tie\n   - Scissors would:\n     * Beat paper if they repeat\n     * Tie with scissors if they make same prediction\n     * Only lose small (-1) to rock if they predict this\n   - This maintains the balanced risk approach that recently worked\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic decision:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   - Its worst-case scenario (-1 point) is better than rock's worst case (-3 points)\n   - This makes it a balanced choice for the first move\n\n[move] paper\n",
