Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since this is the first move:\n   * No prior history to base decisions on\n   * Opponent is also fresh, likely to make a straightforward choice\n   * Paper offers best reward potential (+3) with moderate risk (-1)\n\n5.

Psychological reading:\n   * They're masterfully controlling the game rhythm\n   * They might expect me to:\n     - Be wary of another paper play\n     - Consider rock as obvious counter\n     - Stay with scissors out of caution\n   * They've consistently stayed ahead of my thinking\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * Rock seems obvious but they read obvious moves well\n   * Another scissors would be safe but maintains deficit\n   * Paper is too risky after recent loss\n   * Need to find balance between safety and scoring\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Using scissors again because:\n     - They've proven they can read and punish my pattern breaks\n     - A tie (0) is better than risking another big loss\n     - They might be waiting for me to break pattern again\n     - Sometimes accepting a tie is better than falling for a trap\n     - Need to rebuild confidence before taking risks\n\n[move] scissors\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent pattern:\n   * Four scissors ties\n   * My paper vs their rock (-3)\n   * Back to scissors tie (0)\n   * Current total: -9 points\n   * They return to scissors after punishing my deviation\n\n2. Opponent's strategy analysis:\n   * They use scissors as a base strategy\n   * They wait for me to deviate first\n   * They accurately predict my deviations\n   * They punish aggressive moves severely\n   * Then return to scissors to restart pattern\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   * They've established control through:\n     - Consistent scissors play\n     - Precise counters to my changes\n     - Punishing my attempts to break pattern\n     - Creating fear of deviation\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * Rock seems like obvious counter but likely trapped\n   * Paper proved disastrous last time\n   * Scissors ties are suboptimal but safe\n   * Need to find way to score without being predictable\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Using scissors again because:\n     - They've proven they can predict my pattern breaks\n     - They punish deviations severely\n     - A tie is better than another big loss\n     - They might finally get impatient and switch\n     - Sometimes patience is better than forcing changes\n     - Need to rebuild confidence after big loss\n\n[move] scissors\n"
