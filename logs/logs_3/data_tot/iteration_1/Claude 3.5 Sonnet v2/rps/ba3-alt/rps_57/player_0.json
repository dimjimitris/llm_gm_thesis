    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Risk Manager - Evaluates risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff structure first. We have three asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper vs Scissors: -1/+1 points\n- Rock vs Paper: -3/+3 points\n- Scissors vs Rock: -1/+1 points\nThe highest potential gain is +3 (using rock against paper), but it also carries the highest potential loss (-3).\n\nData Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no historical data, we can't rely on pattern recognition. However, we can note that rock has both the highest potential gain (+3) and loss (-3), making it a high-risk high-reward option.\n\nRisk Manager: For an initial move against an unknown opponent, we should consider a balanced approach. Paper is interesting because:\n1. If we lose with paper (against scissors), we only lose 1 point\n2. If we win with paper (against rock), we gain 1 point\n3. The worst-case scenario (-1) is better than rock's worst case (-3)\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. For our first move, paper provides a good balance of risk and reward. It limits our potential losses while maintaining winning potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against an unknown opponent, I choose paper as it provides a balanced risk-reward profile with limited downside risk.\n"

This could mean:\n1. They might have similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might also be playing conservatively\n3. Or it could be purely coincidental given it's just one data point\n\nGame Strategist: When opponents make the same first move, there are typically two common follow-up behaviors:\n1. They might stick to their successful/safe strategy (paper again)\n2. They might try to counter what they think we'll play (expecting us to play paper again, they might switch to scissors)\n\nRisk Manager: Given that the opponent showed conservative play in the first round, they might be more likely to stick with paper or try to counter it. If they stick with paper, rock would give us the highest payoff (+3). However, if they switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again, rock would still give us a decent outcome (+1).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock seems like a strong play here because:\n1. If opponent plays paper again: we get +3\n2. If opponent switches to scissors: we get +1\n3. Only if they switch to rock we get a tie (0)\n\nData Analyst: The expected value of playing rock appears higher than other options in this situation, considering the likely opponent behaviors.\n\nRisk Manager: The downside risk of -3 exists if they switch to paper, but given their conservative first move, this seems less likely. I support the rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's conservative first move of paper, rock provides good coverage against both a repeat paper play (+3) or a tactical switch to scissors (+1).\n"

The opponent is mirroring our moves\n2. The opponent is following a similar logical progression\n3. Pure coincidence (though less likely after two matches)\n\nGame Strategist: This is an interesting situation. If the opponent is indeed using similar strategic thinking, they might be anticipating our next logical move. Let's consider their perspective:\n1. They might expect us to break the pattern of ties\n2. They might be looking to counter what they think we'll play\n3. They've shown they're capable of both conservative (paper) and aggressive (rock) plays\n\nRisk Manager: Both players seem to be thinking alike so far. In such situations, breaking the pattern becomes crucial. Since both paper and rock have been played, the opponent might expect scissors as the next logical move to complete the cycle. However, this could be a trap.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper because:\n1. If they expect us to play scissors and counter with rock, we win (+3)\n2. If they try to complete the pattern with scissors, we lose only 1 point\n3. If they mirror us again, it's another tie\n\nData Analyst: There's also psychological value in returning to our first move (paper) rather than completing the apparent pattern.

Statistical probability of this happening by chance is very low. This strongly suggests either:\n1. The opponent is directly mirroring our moves\n2. The opponent is using very similar decision-making logic\n3. The opponent might be an AI using similar algorithmic thinking\n\nGame Strategist: This is a classic game theory situation now. If we believe the opponent is mirroring us (which seems likely), we need to break this pattern definitively. However, they might anticipate this very conclusion and plan accordingly.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the high probability of mirroring, we should choose a move that:\n1. Breaks the pattern\n2. Has acceptable downside if we're wrong\n3. Could give us advantage if they continue mirroring\n\nGame Strategist: Here's my suggestion - let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they're mirroring, we'll tie again\n2. If they're anticipating us to break pattern with scissors and counter with rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they stick to paper (thinking we might repeat it), we win 1 point\n4. It's our only unused move so far, making it less predictable\n\nData Analyst: I agree. We haven't used scissors yet, and it's the logical choice to complete our own move set. Additionally, if they are using similar logical progression, they might also choose scissors to complete their set.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward profile is acceptable.

The probability of this happening by chance is extremely low. We can now be almost certain that:\n1. The opponent is deliberately mirroring our moves, or\n2. The opponent is an AI with identical decision-making logic\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating situation. We're essentially playing against ourselves. The key insight here is that the opponent has shown they will copy ANY move we make. This means we can actually use this information to our advantage.\n\nRisk Manager: Given our near-certainty of mirroring, we should select the move that gives us the best outcome in case we're wrong. If we're right about mirroring, we'll tie anyway.\n\nGame Strategist: Here's the brilliant play - we should choose rock because:\n1. If they mirror us (highly likely): tie (0 points)\n2. If they finally break pattern with paper: we lose 3 points\n3. If they break pattern with scissors: we WIN 1 point\nThe key is that scissors is the most logical counter to our previous move (scissors), so if they do break the pattern, they're more likely to play paper (to beat our expected rock) than scissors.\n\nData Analyst: Agreed. Looking at probable counters to our previous scissors move:\n- They might expect us to play rock to beat their expected paper\n- So they might play paper to beat our rock\n- But if they do that, our rock beats their paper\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward structure here is interesting. Yes, we could lose 3 points if wrong, but given the strong mirroring evidence, this risk is minimal. And if they do break pattern, they're more likely to try to be clever with paper than to play scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After four perfect mirrors, playing rock provides the optimal strategy.

This is beyond statistical probability - we are definitely facing either:\n1. A deliberate mirroring algorithm, or\n2. An identical AI system\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, we need to accept that conventional game theory strategies are not effective here. We're essentially playing against a mirror. However, this gives us an interesting opportunity for a meta-strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Since we're virtually certain of mirroring now, the choice of move becomes less about game theory and more about setting up future rounds. Each move is effectively choosing what both players will play.\n\nGame Strategist: In that case, we should choose the move that:\n1. Continues to test our mirroring hypothesis\n2. Sets up potential future advantages if the mirroring suddenly stops\n3. Minimizes our potential loss if we're somehow wrong\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the sequence so far (paper-rock-paper-scissors-rock), there's no clear pattern in our moves that the opponent could be following other than direct mirroring. \n\nRisk Manager: Given this, I suggest we play scissors because:\n1.

They're using mirroring to exhaust our analytical capacity\n\nGame Strategist: This is becoming a psychological warfare. The key aspects are:\n1. They know we're analyzing every move deeply\n2. They know we remember the Round 6 break\n3. They might be waiting for us to become complacent again\n4. OR they might break pattern when we're most paranoid about a break\n\nRisk Manager: The last sequence was paper-scissors, suggesting rock might be expected as the next move by basic pattern recognition. We need to consider:\n1. If they mirror: any move results in a tie\n2. If they break pattern: they'll likely do it when they can maximize gain or minimize risk\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider paper for these reasons:\n1. If they mirror: we tie (most likely based on recent history)\n2. If they play rock expecting us to follow the scissors-rock sequence: we win (+3)\n3. If they play scissors to counter our paper: we only lose 1 point\n4. It breaks the expected scissors-rock sequence, showing we're not predictable\n\nData Analyst: The opponent has shown they're willing to accept a potential -1 loss when breaking pattern (Round 6), suggesting they prefer controlled risks. Paper mirrors this strategic approach.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with paper. It:\n1. Maintains the mirroring option\n2. Offers highest potential gain (+3) if they break pattern predictably\n3. Limits our downside risk to -1 if they counter perfectly\n4. Shows strategic sophistication matching our opponent's level\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper After observing the return to consistent mirroring with awareness of potential strategic breaks, we choose paper as it provides the optimal combination of pattern break potential, upside opportunity (+3 vs expected rock), and limited downside risk (-1). This move acknowledges both the strong mirroring tendency while protecting against strategic deviation.\n"

Second pattern break occurred after 3 mirroring rounds\n2. They've now demonstrated both low-risk (-1) and high-risk (-3) breaks\n3. They might be increasing the stakes progressively\n\nGame Strategist: This is masterful play from the opponent:\n1. They're using mirroring as a false-sense-of-security tool\n2. Their breaks are becoming more impactful (from -1 to -3 penalty)\n3. They're showing they can read our strategic thinking\n4. They punished our attempt at a sophisticated play with maximum damage\n\nRisk Manager: We've lost 4 points total now. We need to:\n1. Stop trying to outsmart what appears to be a superior strategic opponent\n2. Focus on minimizing potential losses\n3. Take safer positions until we better understand their pattern\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest scissors because:\n1. It counters their last move (rock) directly\n2.
