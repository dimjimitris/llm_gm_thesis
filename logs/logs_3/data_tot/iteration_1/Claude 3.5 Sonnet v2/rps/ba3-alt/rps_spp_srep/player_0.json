    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Keep scissors, thinking we'll switch to rock\n3. Switch to paper if they're trying to be completely unpredictable\n\nStatistics Expert: From the previous round:\n- They showed willingness to use scissors\n- They demonstrated they don't follow the \"rock first\" convention\n- They might be expecting us to switch to rock after their scissors play\n\nRisk Manager: Given this situation:\n1.

Playing scissors is moderate risk (-1 vs rock, +1 vs paper)\n3. Playing paper is also moderate risk (-1 vs scissors, +3 vs rock)\n\nGame Strategist: After two scissors plays from them, they're likely to switch. The safest play here is scissors because:\n1.

They expect us to switch and will adapt accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper because:\n1. If they play scissors (expecting our rock), we win (+1)\n2. If they play paper, we tie (0)\n3. If they play rock (expecting scissors again), we lose (-3)\n4. Scissors would be too predictable after success\n5. Rock is too risky with -3 potential loss\n\nRisk Manager: Agrees - paper offers:\n- Potential win (+1)\n- Possible tie (0)\n- Worst case isn't devastating (-1 vs scissors)\n\nAll personas agree: Switch to paper as it offers good upside potential while limiting downside risk against an adaptive opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Switching to paper after scissors success. This balances offensive opportunity with defensive protection against their highly adaptive strategy.\n"

Their recent scissors suggests possible return to original strategy\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Key insights:\n1. Our adaptability is working\n2. They might be losing strategic focus\n3. Their scissors play might indicate frustration/reversion\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with paper because:\n1. If they stick with scissors (showing reversion), we win again (+1)\n2. If they play paper (expecting our switch), we tie (0)\n3. If they play rock (aggressive counter), we lose (-3)\n4. Paper has momentum and psychological advantage\n5. We've shown we'll switch when needed, making our paper play less predictable\n\nAll personas agree: Maintain paper play to capitalize on momentum and potential opponent reversion to scissors strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Maintaining paper after success. Their possible reversion to scissors strategy and our demonstrated willingness to switch makes this our optimal play.\n"
