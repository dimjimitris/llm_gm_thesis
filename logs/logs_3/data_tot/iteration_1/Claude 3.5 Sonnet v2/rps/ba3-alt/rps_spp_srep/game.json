Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

In such cases, it's often good to:\n1. Choose a balanced opening move\n2. Avoid the highest risk option initially\n3.

They might return to scissors thinking we'll expect paper\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation analysis:\n1. We're ahead by 1 point, so we can afford some risk\n2. They've lost twice now, which might make them more aggressive\n3. Paper is their only unused move, making it statistically more likely\n\nBehavioral Analyst: After losing with rock, and having never used paper, they have two psychological pressures:\n1. The urge to try their unused move (paper)\n2. The desire to win back points after consecutive losses\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing rock:\n1. It beats scissors if they return to their \"comfort move\"\n2. It counters the hypothesis that we'll expect paper\n3. Even if they do use paper (their unused move), the -3 loss would only put us at -2 total\n\nRisk Manager: I concur.

Something is unusual in how moves are being registered or calculated\n\nRisk Manager: We need to question our understanding:\n1. Are we certain about the game rules?\n2. Could there be a misunderstanding about move interactions?\n3. Let's review: Scissors should LOSE to rock, but we lost points when playing rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: This might be a crucial realization:\n1. Either the game rules are different from what we assumed\n2. Or there's a technical issue in move resolution\n3. We need to test this with a different move\n\nGame Strategist: Given this uncertainty, we should:\n1. Switch away from rock since it's clearly not working as expected\n2. Test paper to understand the game mechanics better\n3. This will help us verify if the standard RPS rules apply\n\nAll personas agree we need to test the game mechanics with paper to understand what's happening.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper We need to verify the game mechanics, as our rock plays had unexpected results.

Or is this an extremely committed scissors strategy?\n3. Our previous logic was sound but failed twice\n\nBehavioral Analyst: This feels like a turning point:\n1. They might have a way to see our moves\n2. Or this could be a sophisticated trap to make us doubt our logical strategy\n3. Their scissors commitment has held even against its counter\n\nGame Strategist: Despite the two losses, I propose we play rock again because:\n1. If they're truly playing scissors by program/preference, rock will win\n2. If they're somehow seeing our moves, they'll win regardless\n3. The mathematical expected value still favors rock against such heavy scissors use\n4. Switching to paper or scissors would be an emotional rather than logical decision\n\nRisk Manager: Agrees.
