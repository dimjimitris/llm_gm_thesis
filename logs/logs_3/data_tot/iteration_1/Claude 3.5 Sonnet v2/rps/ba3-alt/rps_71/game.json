Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering the points:\n   * Rock has potential for +1 win/-3 loss\n   * Paper has potential for +3 win/-1 loss\n   * Scissors has potential for +1 win/-1 loss\n\n4. Analysis:\n   * Paper has the highest potential gain (+3)\n   * Scissors has the most balanced risk/reward ratio\n   * Rock has the worst potential loss (-3)\n\n5. For the first move with no prior information:\n   * Paper could give the highest reward\n   * But Scissors has the most balanced risk/reward\n   * Rock seems too risky due to high potential loss\n\n6.

Key observations:\n- Rock has the highest potential win (3 points)\n- But rock also has highest potential loss (-3 points)\n- Scissors and paper have more balanced outcomes (1/-1)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n- Without knowledge of opponent's tendencies, safer moves might be better\n- Scissors or paper provide more balanced risk/reward\n- Many players tend to choose rock as first move in RPS games\n\n5.
