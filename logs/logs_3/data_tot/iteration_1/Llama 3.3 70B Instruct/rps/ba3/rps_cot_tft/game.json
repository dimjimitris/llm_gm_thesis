I'm starting to think that this game is going to continue indefinitely, with neither player able to gain an advantage. I'm going to keep making moves, but I'm not expecting anything to change. I'll choose rock, which is a move that I've made many times before, and see if anything happens. Maybe this time will be different, but I'm not holding my breath. I'll just keep playing and see what happens.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I've made every move possible, and my opponent has mirrored me every time. I'm starting to think that this game is unwinnable, at least in the classical sense. I'm going to choose scissors, not because I think it will give me an advantage, but because it's the only move left to make. Maybe, just maybe, my opponent will slip up and make a different move, giving me a chance to win. But I'm not holding my breath.\n",

At this point, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a never-ending loop, where no matter what move I make, my opponent will always mirror it and we'll end up with a tie. I'm going to keep making moves, but I'm not expecting to win anytime soon. I'll choose scissors, which is a move that I've made many times before, and see if anything changes. Maybe someday, my opponent will make a mistake or deviate from their strategy, and I'll be able to gain an advantage. Until then, I'll just keep playing and hope for the best.\n",

Something has to give eventually, and I'm hoping to find a way to break the tie cycle and win a round.\n"
