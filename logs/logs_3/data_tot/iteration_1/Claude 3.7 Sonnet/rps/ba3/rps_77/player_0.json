Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Consider the asymmetry in payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower rewards (1 point each)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Traditional rock-paper-scissors strategy suggests randomization, but the asymmetric payoffs change optimal strategy.\n\n5. Due to the higher payoff for paper winning against rock (3 points vs. 1 point for other winning combinations), paper has a slight strategic advantage.\n\n6. For the first move without prior information, choosing paper offers the potential for the highest gain if the opponent chooses rock.\n\n7. If the opponent anticipates this logic and chooses scissors, my loss would be minimal (-1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper for the first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - My opponent also chose paper\n   - The round ended in a tie with 0 points for both players\n\n2. Consider what my opponent might be thinking:\n   - Since we both chose paper last time, my opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to something else\n   - A common behavior in RPS games is to shift to the move that would have beaten the previous choice\n   - Following this logic, my opponent might expect me to play scissors (which beats paper)\n\n3. If my opponent thinks I'll play scissors, they would likely play rock to counter it\n\n4. Consider the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Given the higher potential payoff of paper (3 points if it wins) and considering that my opponent might play rock anticipating my scissors, playing paper again could be advantageous.\n\n6. However, there's also a chance my opponent might stay with paper, expecting me to switch to rock. In that case, scissors would be best.\n\n7. Considering the risk-reward ratio, scissors offers a moderate gain (1 point) with a moderate risk (-1 point), while paper offers a high gain (3 points) with a moderate risk (-1 point).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, predicting that my opponent might stay with paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze current standing:\n   - My accumulated score is now -5 points\n   - I've lost 4 consecutive rounds (with one tie)\n   - I've correctly predicted their move only twice out of nine rounds\n\n3. Reconsider opponent's pattern:\n   - Their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors three times in their last four moves\n   - This suggests a possible preference for scissors lately\n\n4. Pattern breakdown:\n   - I haven't been able to successfully predict a consistent pattern\n   - They seem to be either successfully anticipating my moves or using a complex pattern\n   - Their playing scissors again breaks the pattern I thought I identified\n\n5. Game theory approach:\n   - In standard RPS with equal payoffs, the optimal strategy is random selection with equal probability\n   - However, this game has unequal payoffs, favoring paper wins (3 points vs 1 point)\n   - Given their apparent preference for scissors recently, rock would counter effectively\n\n6. Risk minimization:\n   - I'm performing poorly, so should prioritize limiting further losses\n   - Rock has highest potential loss (-3) but seems most likely to win against their recent scissors preference\n   - My attempts at pattern recognition have failed; a simpler strategy might be better\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - They've played scissors in 4/9 rounds (44% of the time), a much higher frequency than random\n   - They just played scissors twice in a row, suggesting possible continued preference\n   - Rock is the direct counter to scissors\n   - While rock carries higher risk against paper, their recent play suggests scissors is more likely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to counter their apparent preference for scissors in recent rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological consideration:\n   - After a tie with both playing rock, many players would switch to paper (to beat rock)\n   - If they anticipate I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors\n   - However, they might also stick with rock, expecting me to play scissors (a common move after rock)\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Paper: Wins against rock (3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point)\n   - Rock: Wins against scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3 points)\n   - Scissors: Wins against paper (1 point), loses to rock (-1 point)\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Given my negative score, I need to be cautious but also seek opportunities to gain points\n   - If they expect me to play paper and counter with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they stick with rock, we tie again (0 points)\n   - If they play paper, I lose (-3 points)\n   - Given their frequent use of scissors in recent rounds, rock remains a relatively safe choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again, anticipating they might switch to scissors expecting my paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current situation:\n   - My accumulated score is now -14 points\n   - I've lost 9 out of the last 10 non-tie rounds\n   - My strategy attempts have consistently failed\n\n3. Opponent's full pattern:\n   - Their moves: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\n   - They've now played scissors three times in a row\n   - This is the first time they've shown such a strong preference for one move consecutively\n\n4. Statistical analysis:\n   - Their move distribution: paper (6 times), scissors (7 times), rock (3 times)\n   - Scissors is now their most played move\n   - They've played scissors against my paper 4 times successfully\n   - They've played scissors in the last 3 rounds\n\n5. Psychological consideration:\n   - Playing the same move three times in a row is unusual\n   - They might switch now, expecting me to counter scissors\n   - Alternatively, they might continue with scissors if they believe I'll avoid rock\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - I've had terrible results, so need to prioritize breaking the losing streak\n   - Rock directly counters scissors\n   - While rock carries the highest potential loss (-3), it has the clearest advantage against their recent consistent scissors play\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Their three consecutive scissors plays strongly suggest countering with rock\n   - Even if they switch to paper (their second most common move), I've already lost so many points that the additional risk is worth taking\n   - My previous attempts at finding complex patterns or balancing risk have consistently failed\n   - I need to make a direct counter to their clear recent pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, directly countering their three consecutive scissors plays.

Strategic reconsideration:\n   - All attempts at finding patterns have failed\n   - They appear to be either reading my moves or using a sophisticated algorithm\n   - My best wins came early in the game with scissors (rounds 3 and 4)\n   - Rock has been my most costly move (-12 points total from losses)\n\n5. Opponent move frequency:\n   - Their moves: paper (7 times), scissors (7 times), rock (3 times)\n   - They strongly favor paper and scissors over rock\n   - Paper is now tied with scissors as their most common move\n\n6. Risk management:\n   - Given my extremely negative score, I need to avoid further big losses\n   - Rock has consistently led to the biggest losses (-3 points each time)\n   - I should avoid rock at all costs at this point\n\n7.

Consider opponent's possible strategy:\n   - They've successfully countered my move 11 times in a row\n   - This is statistically improbable with random play (would happen <0.05% of the time)\n   - They might be using my previous move to determine their next one\n   - They might also be using a more sophisticated algorithm\n\n5. Statistical analysis:\n   - Their move distribution: paper (7 times), scissors (7 times), rock (4 times)\n   - Paper and scissors remain tied as their most frequent moves\n   - They've increased their use of rock slightly\n\n6. New approach consideration:\n   - All attempts at pattern recognition have consistently failed\n   - They might be successfully anticipating what I'll play next\n   - I should try something completely different\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Given their last move was rock, they might expect me to play paper\n   - If they expect me to play paper, they might play scissors\n   - I could try to be one step ahead by playing rock, which would beat their expected scissors\n   - However, if they play paper again, I'll lose 3 more points\n   - Given my large negative score, I should prioritize avoiding further large losses\n   - Paper has a balanced risk-reward profile against their most common moves\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. While this directly counters their last move (rock), I recognize this hasn't worked well previously. However, the potential 3-point gain makes it worth the risk, and I need to try different approaches since my previous strategies have consistently failed.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider fundamental game theory:\n   - In a truly random game, each move should be played with equal probability\n   - However, this opponent is clearly not playing randomly\n   - They're either successfully predicting my moves or using a complex algorithm\n\n5. Statistical review:\n   - Their move distribution: paper (7 times), scissors (8 times), rock (4 times)\n   - Scissors is now their most frequent move\n   - They've played scissors against my paper 5 times successfully\n\n6. Consider their possible strategy:\n   - They might be successfully reading my moves in real-time\n   - They might be using my previous move to determine their counter\n   - They might be using a more complex pattern that I haven't detected\n\n7.

Current situation:\n   - My accumulated score is now -19 points\n   - I've only won 3 rounds out of 22\n   - I've lost with scissors against rock 4 times now\n\n3. Opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Their moves: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - Their last move was rock\n   - After playing rock in the past, they've played: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper (no clear pattern)\n\n4. Look for recent patterns:\n   - Their last few moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - When I've played scissors, they've often countered with rock (4/7 times)\n   - Their rock plays have been relatively rare but effective against me\n\n5. Statistical review:\n   - Their move distribution: paper (9 times), scissors (8 times), rock (5 times)\n   - Paper remains their most frequent move\n   - Rock is still their least common move but has increased slightly\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Given my large negative score, I need to consider both potential gains and avoiding losses\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (3 points) but has often lost to their scissors\n   - Rock carries the highest risk (-3 points) but counters their frequent scissors plays\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Their last move was rock, which they've most often followed with scissors or paper\n   - Paper would counter their rock if they play it again\n   - Paper would also counter if they switch to rock as they sometimes do after playing rock\n   - While paper has lost to their scissors often, the higher potential reward makes it worth considering\n   - I need to take some calculated risks to improve my score significantly\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, countering their last move (rock) and giving me the potential for a 3-point gain. While there's risk if they play scissors, the higher reward potential is necessary given my large negative score.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current situation:\n   - My accumulated score is now -20 points\n   - I've lost 14 out of 18 non-tie rounds\n   - My paper plays have lost to scissors 6 times\n\n3. Opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Their moves: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - Their last two moves: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've just played scissors, which has been their counter to my paper plays\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - When I've played paper, they've played scissors 6/8 times (75%)\n   - When I've played scissors, they've played rock 4/7 times (57%)\n   - When I've played rock, they've played paper 4/5 times (80%)\n   - They seem to be successfully countering my moves\n\n5. Statistical overview:\n   - Their move distribution: paper (9 times), scissors (9 times), rock (5 times)\n   - Paper and scissors are now tied as their most frequent moves\n   - Rock remains their least common move\n\n6. New approach consideration:\n   - All attempts at pattern recognition have consistently failed\n   - They seem to be successfully anticipating and countering my moves\n   - I need a completely different strategy\n\n7. Decision logic:\n   - Their last move was scissors\n   - Rock directly counters scissors\n   - While rock carries the highest risk (-3 points if they play paper), it's been my most successful move historically (won in round 3)\n   - Given my extremely negative score, I need to take some calculated risks to gain points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. This directly counters their last move (scissors) and gives me a chance to win with a move I've had success with before. While it carries risk if they play paper (which they often do against my rock), I need to break this pattern of losses.\n\n[move] rock\n"
