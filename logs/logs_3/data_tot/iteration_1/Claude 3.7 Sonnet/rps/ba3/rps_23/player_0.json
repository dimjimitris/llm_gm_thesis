The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same move results in a tie with 0 points for both\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) if it wins, but scissors only loses 1 point if it loses to rock.\n\n4. Rock is a relatively safe choice - it can win 1 point or lose 3 points.\n\n5. Given that paper has the highest upside (3 points), many players might choose it in the first round, which would make scissors a good counter.\n\n6. However, since I have no information about the opponent, I'll go with the move that has the highest potential gain - paper.\n\n7. If my opponent plays rock, I'll gain 3 points. If they play scissors, I'll lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n8. The expected value seems favorable for choosing paper in the first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie with 0 points.\n\n2. This reveals some information - my opponent also chose the move with the highest potential gain (paper) in the first round.\n\n3. Given that we both played paper last time, I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to counter their expected paper) and play rock to counter that\n   - They might simply stick with paper again\n\n4. The most common pattern in RPS after a tie is for at least one player to switch moves.\n\n5. If I were to follow standard RPS psychology, scissors would be a natural follow-up to counter the opponent's potential repeated paper play.\n\n6. However, if my opponent is thinking one step ahead, they might play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n7. Since paper resulted in a tie last time, I should definitely change my strategy. The question is whether to go with rock or scissors.\n\n8. Looking at the payoffs again: if I play scissors and win, I get 1 point. If I play rock and win, I get 1 point. But if I lose with scissors, I lose only 1 point, whereas losing with rock costs me 3 points.\n\n9. The risk-to-reward ratio is better with scissors: potential gain of 1 point with a potential loss of 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors for this round, anticipating that my opponent might play paper again or at least expecting me to play paper again.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

In round 1, both players chose paper (tie).\n2. In round 2, both players chose scissors (tie).\n3. This suggests my opponent and I are thinking similarly or using similar logic.\n\n4. The progression so far has been paper \u2192 scissors. Following standard RPS patterns, the natural next move after scissors would be rock.\n\n5. My opponent might anticipate this and play paper to counter my expected rock play.\n\n6. However, they might also think I'll try to outthink them and stay with scissors, expecting them to play paper, in which case they'd play rock.\n\n7. This is becoming a recursive thinking pattern, which is typical in RPS games.\n\n8. Let me consider the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n\n9. Since our moves have aligned twice, there's a possibility our thinking continues to align. If we both follow the natural progression, we'd both play rock.\n\n10. However, I can try to break this pattern by anticipating they'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\n11. Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) if it wins against rock, and a relatively small loss (1 point) if it loses to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, predicting my opponent will choose rock following the natural progression from scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: Both chose scissors (tie)\n3. Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost 1 point)\n\n2. The pattern of my opponent's moves has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   My moves have been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. This suggests my opponent decided to stick with scissors in round 3, breaking the pattern we both followed in rounds 1-2.\n\n4. My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row. This could mean:\n   - They've found a pattern they like and might continue with scissors\n   - They're aware that continuing with the same move is predictable, so they may switch\n   - They might be using a strategy of repeating moves that win for them\n\n5. If they continue with scissors for a third time, rock would be my best counter.\n\n6. If they anticipate my rock play and switch to paper, I would lose 3 points.\n\n7. If they switch to rock (completing the typical RPS cycle), and I play rock, we'd tie.\n\n8. Given that my opponent has played scissors twice in a row and just won with it, there's a psychological tendency to stick with winning moves.\n\n9. Looking at the risk-reward: \n   - Rock beats scissors: I gain 1 point\n   - Rock loses to paper: I lose 3 points\n   - Rock ties with rock: 0 points\n\n10. Despite the risk of losing 3 points if they switch to paper, I believe the highest probability is that they'll play scissors again or rock.

Round 2: Both scissors (tie)\n3. Round 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost 1 point)\n4. Round 4: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost 3 points)\n5. Round 5: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost 1 point)\n6. Round 6: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won 3 points)\n7. Round 7: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won 1 point)\n8. Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n9. Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost 1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   My moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n\n4. My opponent has played rock in rounds 5, 6, and now 9, but not consecutively. They seem to return to rock after playing other moves.\n\n5. After our tie with paper in round 8, they played rock - which successfully countered my scissors.\n\n6. There seems to be a pattern where my opponent often plays what would beat my previous move:\n   - After I played paper in round 8, they played rock in round 9 (which would beat my previous paper if repeated)\n\n7. If this pattern continues, since I just played scissors, they might play paper (which would beat my scissors if repeated).\n\n8. My current score tally is: +3 (win) + 1 (win) - 1 (loss) - 3 (loss) - 1 (loss) - 1 (loss) = -2 points\n\n9. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n\n10. Given their tendency to play what beats my previous move, and that I just played scissors, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play, based on their apparent strategy of playing what would beat my previous move. The risk-reward is favorable: potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 3 points if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n\n5. Interesting pattern: In rounds 9-10, my opponent played rock-scissors, which is a common RPS sequence.\n\n6. Looking at their full pattern, they've never played paper after scissors. After playing scissors, they've played either rock or scissors again.\n\n7. If they continue with the natural RPS progression, after scissors they might play paper.\n\n8. However, it's also possible they might anticipate that I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), in which case they'd play scissors.\n\n9. I notice my opponent has played scissors in rounds 2, 3, 7, and now 10. This suggests scissors might be their preferred move when uncertain.\n\n10. After losing with scissors in round 10, they might avoid it and play either rock or paper.\n\n11. Looking at the payoff structure and our history:\n    - I've won twice with rock (against scissors)\n    - I've won once with paper (against rock)\n    - I've never won with scissors\n\n12. Given that I just won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again, and counter with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play (either following RPS progression or trying to counter my expected rock). The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the pattern suggests they may avoid immediate repetition of moves after losing.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   My moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. This is our 4th tie in the game. We've tied with paper twice and scissors twice.\n\n4. Looking at the sequence after our previous ties:\n   - After tie with paper in Round 1: both played scissors\n   - After tie with scissors in Round 2: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - After tie with paper in Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n5. After the tie with scissors in Round 2, my opponent played scissors again in Round 3. They've just played scissors twice in a row (Rounds 10-11), so they might play scissors a third time.\n\n6. In RPS psychology, after a tie with scissors, the natural progression is for players to play rock next.\n\n7. If my opponent follows this progression, they'll play rock. However, they might anticipate I'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played scissors 5 times, rock 4 times, and paper 2 times. They seem to favor scissors most.\n\n9. Looking at what has historically followed their scissors plays:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - So after scissors, they've played scissors twice and paper once\n\n10. Given the payoff structure and our history, if I anticipate they'll play scissors again or rock, my best move would be rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would beat scissors if they repeat it a third time (which they've done before), and would also be the natural progression in RPS psychology after a scissors tie. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but based on their history, they play scissors more frequently than paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 10: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n\n5. After our tie with scissors in Round 11, my opponent played paper in Round 12, breaking the common RPS progression (which would be rock after scissors).\n\n6. I notice my opponent has played paper in rounds 1, 4, 8, and now 12. Looking at what follows their paper plays:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - In 2 out of 3 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n7. After playing paper in Round 12, they might follow their most common pattern and play rock next.\n\n8. My opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my moves recently - they countered my rock with paper last round.\n\n9. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent never played the same move more than twice consecutively.\n\n10. The payoff structure reminds me that:\n    - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n    - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n    - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n11. If I expect them to play rock (following their pattern after paper), scissors would be my best counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. While scissors would counter their potential rock play, paper would be effective against rock too (with a higher point gain), and would tie if they play paper again. My reasoning is that after losing with paper, they may avoid it or try to counter my expected scissors play with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My prediction from the last round was correct - they did play rock after their paper, following their historical pattern.\n\n6.

If they follow their most common pattern, they'll play scissors next after their rock.\n\n8. Given our competitive history, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper again (since it just won), and counter with scissors.\n\n9. If they expect me to switch to scissors (to counter their expected scissors), they might play rock.\n\n10. Looking at the payoff structure:\n    - If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), paper would work best\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock), scissors would work best\n\n11. Considering they've played scissors most frequently (5 times), followed by rock (5 times) and paper (3 times), and just lost with rock, scissors seems their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play based on their historical pattern after rock. Rock has worked well for me before against their scissors, and the risk-reward is favorable at this point.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I notice a pattern in rounds 12-14: my opponent has gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, while I've gone rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n6. Their last two moves (rock \u2192 paper) constitute a standard RPS progression. If they continue this progression, they would play scissors next.\n\n7. Looking at what follows their paper plays historically:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 4 cases, they played rock or scissors after paper\n\n8. My opponent has played more paper recently (rounds 12 and 14), which is a shift from their earlier preference for scissors and rock.\n\n9. They might expect me to avoid rock (since I've lost with it twice recently) and play scissors to counter their expected paper, in which case they might play rock.\n\n10. They also might anticipate I'll play paper (to break my rock-paper-rock pattern), and play scissors to counter.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and recent history, scissors would counter their potential paper play and also align with breaking my own pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper again (which they did in 2 of the last 3 rounds), and would break my alternating rock-paper pattern. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the potential to gain 1 point against their possible paper play makes this a reasonable calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I notice a striking pattern in my opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which is the same pattern they showed in rounds 12-14 but reversed (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n6. Looking at their full sequence, my opponent seems to alternate somewhat predictably between paper and rock in the later rounds:\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: rock  \n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: rock\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they might play paper next.\n\n8. I've lost several recent rounds, suggesting my opponent may be successfully anticipating my moves or I'm falling into predictable patterns.\n\n9. Looking at my own sequence, I've played rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 12-15.\n\n10. Considering the payoff structure and recent history:\n    - If they play paper as predicted by their alternating pattern, scissors would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock again (breaking their pattern), paper would work best\n    - If they play scissors (which they haven't played recently), rock would work best\n\n11. Given that I've just lost with scissors against rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors and play paper or rock instead.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter their rock if they play it again, and their scissors if they decide to switch to that move. While it would lose to scissors, they haven't played scissors in the last 5 rounds, making it less likely. Their alternating pattern suggests paper might be next, but given my recent losses, I'm anticipating they might play rock again to exploit my expected move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score is still -4 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n\n5. My opponent broke their alternating paper-rock pattern in round 16 by playing paper again after rock.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 ?\n\n7. After our previous paper ties, there's no consistent pattern from my opponent.\n\n8. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often move to scissors.\n\n9. My opponent has played paper in rounds 12, 14, and 16 recently. After playing paper in round 12, they played rock in round 13. After playing paper in round 14, they played rock in round 15.\n\n10. Based on their historical pattern after paper plays, they might play rock next.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play scissors (the natural counter to paper), and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n12. Since we both just played paper, and their pattern suggests rock often follows their paper play, scissors would be risky.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter their potential scissors play (if they follow standard RPS psychology after a tie) and would tie if they play rock as their historical pattern suggests. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper again, but given they just played paper and their tendency to switch after paper, this seems less likely.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score remains -4 points after another tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n\n5. We're now seeing consecutive ties, which suggests we might be thinking similarly or following similar logic patterns.\n\n6. Looking at what follows rock ties historically:\n   - This is our first rock tie in the game.\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with rock, players often move to paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played rock in rounds 15 and 17 recently. Prior to that, they played rock in rounds 13, 9, 6, and 5.\n\n9. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 ?\n   - In 2 out of 5 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 other cases, they played paper\n\n10. Their more recent pattern after rock has been to play paper (rounds 14 and 16).\n\n11. In the current flow of the game, we've had paper tie \u2192 rock tie. If traditional RPS psychology holds, the next logical move would be paper to beat rock, but since we both just played rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n12. Given the payoff structure, recent game flow, and my opponent's historical patterns:\n    - If they play paper (following standard progression after rock tie), scissors would counter\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would counter\n    - If they play rock again, paper would counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This aligns with the natural progression after a rock tie, would beat rock if they play it a third time, and has the highest potential point gain (3 points). The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but based on the game flow and their historical patterns, paper seems the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n\n5. After our rock tie in Round 17, they played scissors in Round 18, which deviates from the standard RPS progression (paper would typically follow rock).\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern, they played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 16-18, which is a full RPS cycle.\n\n7. If they continue this cycling pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Looking at what follows their scissors plays historically:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R3) \u2192 Paper (R4)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - Scissors (R11) \u2192 Paper (R12)\n   - Scissors (R18) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 5 cases, they played paper after scissors\n\n9. Their most common follow-up to scissors has been paper, but they've also repeated scissors or played rock.\n\n10. Given that I just lost with paper against their scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock next (to counter their scissors), and respond with paper.\n\n11. Looking at the overall game, my opponent has been successful at anticipating my moves recently.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as suggested by their cycling pattern, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play paper as their historical pattern after scissors suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter if they repeat scissors (which they've done before) and would align with breaking the pattern of my recent losses. While it would lose to paper, paper seems less likely based on their recent cycling pattern. The rock choice balances potential gain against risk in the current game context.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n\n5. I've lost the last two rounds, and my opponent has successfully countered my moves both times.\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern, they've played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in rounds 17-19, which is a full RPS cycle in the standard order.\n\n7. If they continue this cycling pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Looking at what follows their paper plays historically:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 ?\n   - In 5 out of 6 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. Their most consistent pattern has been to play rock after paper, which aligns with the cycling pattern observed in rounds 17-19.\n\n10. Given that I just lost with rock against their paper, they might anticipate I'll play paper next (to counter their paper), and respond with scissors.\n\n11. However, if they follow their strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper, scissors would lose.\n\n12.

Their historical pattern of playing rock after paper is their strongest pattern in the game (5 out of 6 times), and it also aligns with their recent cycling pattern.

My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 = -5 points (improved from -8)\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n\n5. My prediction from last round was correct - they did play rock after paper, following their strongest historical pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves, they've played scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in rounds 18-20, which is a full RPS cycle in reverse order.\n\n7. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 6 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 cases, paper\n\n8. Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper, but scissors is their most common follow-up (3 out of 6 times).\n\n9. Given that I just won with paper against their rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper again (since it worked), and respond with scissors.\n\n10. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they'll play scissors.\n\n11. If they continue their reverse cycling pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), they might play paper next.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and my recent win:\n    - If they play scissors as their historical pattern after rock suggests, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper as their reverse cycling pattern suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat rock, paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper (following their reverse cycling pattern) and would break the pattern of my paper-rock-paper sequence. While it would lose to rock if they repeat it, their historical pattern suggests scissors is more likely after rock. Given that they might anticipate I'll repeat paper after winning with it, scissors seems the most strategic choice to avoid being predictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   My moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 -1 = -6 points\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n\n5. My opponent has played rock twice in a row now (rounds 20-21), breaking their previous patterns.\n\n6. Looking at their longer pattern of play:\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - This suggests they might be establishing a new pattern or responding to my moves differently.\n\n7. Looking at instances where they've played rock twice in a row:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21) \u2192 ?\n   - The only previous time they played rock twice, they followed with scissors.\n\n8. Looking at my own recent moves:\n   - Rock (R19) \u2192 Paper (R20) \u2192 Scissors (R21)\n   - I've been cycling through RPS in order, which could be predictable.\n\n9. After playing rock twice, they might:\n   - Continue with rock a third time (though this is rare in RPS)\n   - Switch to paper (following standard progression)\n   - Switch to scissors (as they did the only other time they played rock twice)\n\n10. If I were to follow my own pattern, I'd play rock next. They might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock a third time, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play paper, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\n12. Given that I've lost several times with scissors against rock, and they've now played rock twice in a row, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter their rock if they play it a third time (with the highest potential gain of 3 points), and break my apparent cycling pattern. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but given their consistency with rock recently and the higher potential gain, paper is worth the calculated risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score remains -6 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n\n5. My opponent switched from playing rock twice in a row to playing paper, resulting in our tie.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 Both rock (R17)\n   - Paper tie (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - After paper ties, we've seen scissors-scissors, scissors-rock, and rock-rock\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a paper tie, scissors is a common follow-up.\n\n8. Looking at my opponent's sequence after paper plays (not just ties):\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20)\n   - Paper (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - In 6 out of 7 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. Their most consistent pattern throughout the game has been to play rock after paper.\n\n10. If they follow this strong pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as their historical pattern strongly suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors following standard psychology after a paper tie, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper again, it would result in another tie\n\n12. Given their very strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper (6 out of 7 times), I'll prepare for that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again this round. While this goes against the standard expectation to switch moves after a tie, my opponent has shown a remarkably consistent pattern of playing rock after paper throughout the game. If they follow this pattern, I'll win 3 points. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but their historical consistency makes paper the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 -1 +3 = -3 points (improved from -6)\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n\n5. My prediction was correct - they did play rock after paper in round 23, continuing their strongest pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22) \u2192 Rock (R23)\n\n7. Looking at what follows after they play rock and I win with paper:\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They will play ?\n   - Their responses have been inconsistent after losing to paper\n\n8. Looking at their pattern after playing rock historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 ?\n   - After rock, they've played scissors 3 times, paper 3 times, and rock 2 times\n\n9. Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper.\n\n10. I've now played paper twice in a row and won both times. They might strongly expect me to play paper again, which would lead them to play scissors.\n\n11. If they follow the standard RPS psychology of not repeating the same move after losing, they'll play either scissors or paper instead of rock.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and recent game flow:\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my repeated paper), rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper (as they've done after rock 3 times), scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play rock again (as they've done after rock 2 times), paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. Given that I've won with paper twice in a row, they're very likely to anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors. Rock would beat their scissors if they follow this logic. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but given the psychology of the game after my repeated paper plays, scissors seems their most likely response.\n\n[move] rock\n"
