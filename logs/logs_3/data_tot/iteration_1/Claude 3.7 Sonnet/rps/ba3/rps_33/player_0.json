    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Consider the expected values:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-1)\n   - Rock has medium potential gain (+1) but the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Scissors has medium potential gain (+1) but medium potential loss (-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I don't have prior information about their tendencies\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in the first round as a default\n   - Paper would beat rock and give me the highest possible gain (+3)\n   - If they choose scissors instead, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they choose paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n4. The risk-reward ratio of choosing paper seems optimal for the first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review what happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3-20: I won all rounds by predicting their moves correctly\n   - My current total: Won 18 consecutive rounds\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Their pattern has remained perfectly consistent through all 20 rounds without a single deviation\n   - The clockwise rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock) is absolutely established\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - I've won eighteen rounds in a row by predicting their moves perfectly\n   - There is absolutely no reason to believe they will ever change their strategy\n   - This is certainly a bot or a player committed to this rotation regardless of outcomes\n\n4. Evaluate my options considering the opponent will play paper:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, we tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point\n\n5. Scissors is clearly the optimal move:\n   - It beats the predicted move (paper)\n   - Continues my winning streak\n   - Prevents the high penalty of losing to paper (-3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
