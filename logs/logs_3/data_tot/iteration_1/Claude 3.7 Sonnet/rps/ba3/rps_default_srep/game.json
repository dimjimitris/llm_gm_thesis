The opponent has demonstrated their ability to change strategy by playing rock instead of scissors\n2. This significant change suggests they may maintain rock for at least another round\n3. If they continue with rock, my paper will win (+3 points)\n4. If they anticipate my switch and play scissors, I would lose (-1 point)\n5. If they switch to paper as well, we would tie (0 points)\n\nThis is a calculated risk, but the opponent's first deviation from scissors suggests they may be implementing a new approach.

My rock strategy has now been successful three times in a row against their scissors, earning me 1 point each time.\n\nMy reasoning for maintaining rock yet again:\n1.

They may be attempting to condition me to expect scissors and then switch to paper, but haven't done so yet\n3. At this point, they almost certainly expect me to continue with rock, so they should logically play paper\n4. However, given their demonstrated tendency to repeat scissors despite losses, there's still a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again\n\nThis is becoming an interesting psychological test - conventional game theory would suggest they should have switched to paper already, but their persistence with scissors makes continuing with rock a reasonable, if risky, strategy.
