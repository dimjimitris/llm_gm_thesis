First, I need to understand the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not a standard rock-paper-scissors game because the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) and punishment (-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give smaller rewards (+1) and penalties (-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3), making it potentially attractive.\n\n5. However, if I choose paper and my opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n6. If I choose rock and my opponent chooses paper, I lose 3 points, which is the worst possible outcome.\n\n7. The expected value calculation would be important here, but without knowing opponent tendencies, I need to consider the risk-reward tradeoff.\n\n8.
