    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I finally broke the losing streak by switching up my strategy. My hypothesis about their pattern might be correct - they seemed to be anticipating that I would play scissors (the counter to their rock), but I played rock instead and won.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nI'm choosing paper because:\n1. If the opponent is following the pattern I identified, they would expect me to play rock against their scissors (which I just did), so they might play paper to counter my expected rock\n2. By playing paper instead, I'm disrupting that expectation\n3. If they play scissors again, I'll lose (-1 point)\n4. If they play rock expecting me to play scissors (to counter their scissors), I'll win (+3 points)\n5. If they play paper expecting me to play rock, it's a tie\n\nSince my theory about breaking their predictive pattern worked in the last round, I'm continuing with the strategy of not playing the direct counter to their last move. Instead of scissors (which would counter their scissors), I'm playing paper to try to stay one step ahead of their predictions.\n"
