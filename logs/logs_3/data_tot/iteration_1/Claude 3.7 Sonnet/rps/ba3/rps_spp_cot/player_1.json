Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The highest potential reward comes from playing paper and winning (3 points), but it also risks losing to scissors (-1 points).\n5. Rock gives a moderate potential win (1 point) against scissors but risks a larger loss (-3 points) against paper.\n6. Scissors has a moderate potential win (1 point) against paper but risks a moderate loss (-1 point) against rock.\n7. Without prior information, I need to make an initial choice that balances risk and reward.\n8.

My opponent seems to be playing strategically, countering my moves:\n   - They played paper to beat my rock\n   - They played rock to beat my scissors\n4. This suggests they might be anticipating my moves or following a rotation strategy of their own.\n5. Looking at their pattern, they've played paper \u2192 rock. If they continue a rotation pattern, they might play scissors next.\n6. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll try to counter their last move (rock) by playing paper, so they might play scissors to counter that.\n7. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (as the pattern suggests), I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper again, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors (which counters my expected paper), I lose 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play rock again, I win 3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock again, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point\n8.

Let me review all rounds played so far:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n2. I notice a clear pattern: my opponent has played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which is the standard rock-paper-scissors sequence.\n3. More importantly, they seem to be consistently playing the move that beats my choice. This suggests they might be:\n   - Predicting my moves with high accuracy\n   - Following a predetermined pattern that happens to counter mine\n   - Possibly receiving information about my moves before making theirs (though unlikely)\n4. If they're following the standard rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), their next move should be paper.\n5. If they're continuing to counter my expected move, they might anticipate I'll play rock (to counter their scissors) and thus play paper.\n6. Given their perfect counter-strategy so far, I should break the pattern in an unexpected way.\n7. Let me evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper (either continuing their rotation or countering me), I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors again, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock (countering me), I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper (following their rotation), I win 1 point\n8. The safest option with potential gain appears to be playing scissors. If they follow their rotation to paper, I win. If they continue perfectly countering me, they'll play rock and I'll lose only 1 point (better than losing 3 with rock).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I expected rock according to their original pattern, but they played scissors instead.\n\n3. This suggests they might be:\n   - Playing more adaptively and trying to anticipate my moves\n   - Following a different pattern I haven't fully identified\n   - Making some random moves to confuse my strategy\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 11: They played scissors\n   - Round 12: They played paper\n   - Round 13: They played scissors\n\n5. There's no obvious pattern in these last three moves, but they might be responding to my moves rather than following their own pattern.\n\n6. Since they've just played scissors, I have three options:\n   - Play rock to beat their scissors (if they repeat)\n   - Play paper (risky if they repeat scissors)\n   - Play scissors (if they switch to rock, I lose)\n\n7.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n\n2. Their recent move sequence is now: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. My successful prediction suggests they are indeed trying to anticipate and counter what they think I'll play next.\n\n4. They just played rock, likely expecting me to play scissors (to counter their previous paper).\n\n5. After losing this round, they might:\n   - Expect me to continue with paper since it worked\n   - Anticipate I might switch to scissors to counter their expected paper\n   - Try to counter my expected paper with scissors\n\n6. If they expect me to stick with paper, they'll likely play scissors.\n\n7. I could:\n   - Continue with paper (but lose to their potential scissors)\n   - Switch to scissors (which would tie with their scissors but lose to potential rock)\n   - Switch to rock (which would beat their scissors if they're trying to counter my expected paper)\n\n8. Since they seem to be trying to counter what they think I'll play, and they might expect me to play paper again, rock is my best option to counter their potential scissors play.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they'll play scissors to counter my expected paper) Rock\n"

Their recent move sequence is now: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. This sequence looks like the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, but in reverse order: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Additionally, they seem to be adapting to counter what they think I'll play next, but they're one step behind.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Expect me to continue with rock since it worked\n   - Try to counter my expected rock with paper\n   - Be hesitant to play scissors again after just losing with it\n\n6. If they're following the reverse cycle, their next move would be paper (after scissors).\n\n7. If they're trying to counter my expected rock (assuming I stick with what worked), they'd also play paper.\n\n8. Both analyses point to them likely playing paper next.\n\n9. To counter their expected paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] (Countering their expected paper move based on their reverse cycle) Scissors\n"

Their recent move sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. This confirms they're following a reverse cycle pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc.\n\n4. They've been predictable with this pattern for the last four rounds.\n\n5. If they continue this reverse cycle, their next move would be rock (after paper).\n\n6. However, they've now lost three rounds in a row, which might prompt them to change their strategy.\n\n7. They might:\n   - Continue their reverse cycle with rock\n   - Break the pattern to try to be less predictable\n   - Try to directly counter what they think I'll play next\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper (to counter their expected rock in the reverse cycle), they might play scissors.\n\n9. Given their consistency with the reverse cycle pattern over four rounds, and the fact that changing strategies after losses is common, I need to balance these possibilities.\n\n10. I'll play paper to counter their expected rock if they continue their pattern, which has been their most consistent behavior.\n\n[move] (Countering their expected rock move based on their reverse cycle pattern) Paper\n"
