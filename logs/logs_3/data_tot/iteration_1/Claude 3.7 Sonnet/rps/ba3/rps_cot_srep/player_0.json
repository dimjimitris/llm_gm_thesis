Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I'll analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. I note that paper beating rock has the highest reward (+3) and highest penalty (-3), making it a high-risk, high-reward option.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what most players tend to choose in their first move.\n\n4. Research suggests many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it psychologically feels \"strongest\" or \"safest.\"\n\n5. If my opponent plays rock, then paper would give me the maximum possible gain (+3).\n\n6. If they play scissors (trying to be clever), I would lose with paper (-1).\n\n7. If they play paper (anticipating my rock), and I play paper too, it's a tie (0).\n\n8. The potential reward of playing paper (+3) outweighs the potential penalty (-1) given the probability distribution of first moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This could indicate several things about my opponent:\n   - They might anticipate that many players start with paper\n   - They might favor scissors as an opening move\n   - They might be a strategic player who predicted my move\n\n3.

If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - This seems likely since winning strategies tend to be repeated\n\n5. If they switch to rock anticipating my scissors, and I play rock, we tie (0)\n\n6. If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, and I play rock, I lose (-3)\n   - This is the worst outcome\n\n7.

After winning with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with rock (as they did with their scissors streak)\n   - Switch to paper (to counter potential rock from me)\n   - Switch to scissors (to be unpredictable)\n\n5. Their behavior after consecutive wins:\n   - After winning with scissors in round 1, they played scissors again\n   - After winning with paper in round 6, they played paper again\n   - After winning with scissors in round 14, they returned to rock\n   - This suggests they often repeat successful moves\n\n6. Given they just won with rock and they've developed a pattern of repeating successful moves, there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n7. If they play rock again, paper would be my best counter (+3).\n\n8. If they switch to scissors, and I play paper, I lose (-1).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, and I play paper, we tie (0).\n\n10. Though playing paper carries the risk of losing to scissors, the potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\n11. Additionally, they've now played rock in back-to-back rounds for the first time since early in the game, suggesting they may be establishing a new pattern of repetition.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll stick with rock based on their tendency to repeat successful moves and their recent pattern shift.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My current score: +7 - 1 = +6 points after another loss.\n\n4. I've now lost 3 of the last 4 rounds, suggesting my opponent may be developing a more sophisticated strategy.\n\n5. Their recent sequence (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) breaks their previous patterns.\n\n6. After winning with scissors against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (repeating a successful move)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (trying to be unpredictable)\n\n7. Looking at their overall game behavior:\n   - They've significantly favored scissors (53% of moves)\n   - They've rarely played paper (only 12% of moves)\n   - They've often switched after establishing apparent patterns\n\n8. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n11.

My current score remains at +6 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at their behavior after rock ties:\n   - After our rock tie in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After our rock tie in round 15, they played rock again in round 16\n   - Their pattern after rock ties is inconsistent\n\n5. More generally, looking at all their moves after ties:\n   - After scissors tie in round 4, they played rock in round 5\n   - After rock tie in round 5, they played paper in round 6\n   - After scissors tie in round 10, they played rock in round 11\n   - After scissors tie in round 13, they played scissors in round 14\n   - After rock tie in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - Their behavior after ties has become less predictable\n\n6. If they follow their earliest pattern after a rock tie (from rounds 5-6), they might play paper.\n\n7. If they follow their more recent behavior of repeating moves (as in rounds 15-16), they might play rock again.\n\n8. They've been increasingly favoring rock lately (3 of the last 4 moves).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, scissors would be my best counter (+1).\n\n10. If they stick with rock, and I play scissors, I lose (-1).\n\n11. If they switch to scissors, and I play scissors, we tie (0).\n\n12. Given their recent emphasis on rock and their historical pattern of sometimes playing paper after a rock tie, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\n13. Playing paper would:\n    - Beat their rock if they repeat it (+3)\n    - Tie against their paper if they follow their earliest pattern (0)\n    - Lose to scissors if they switch (-1)\n\n14. The expected value of playing paper is higher than scissors or rock, considering their recent tendencies.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll either stick with rock (based on their recent frequency) or switch to paper (based on their earliest pattern after a rock tie).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I need to break the pattern of my recent losses:\n   - Playing paper has resulted in losses in rounds 14, 17, and 19\n   - Playing scissors resulted in a loss in round 16\n   - Playing rock resulted in ties in rounds 15 and 18\n\n7.

My current score: +5 + 1 = +6 points after breaking my losing streak with a win.\n\n4. After losing with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (to counter potential repeated rock)\n   - Try paper (to beat my successful rock)\n   - Continue with scissors (though this seems illogical after losing with it)\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 2, they switched to rock\n   - After losing with rock in round 3, they switched to scissors\n   - After losing with paper in round 7, they switched to rock\n   - After losing with scissors in round 9, they stayed with scissors\n   - After losing with rock in round 11, they switched to scissors\n   - Their behavior after losses varies, but they often switch\n\n6. They've now played scissors in 4 of the last 6 rounds despite mixed results, suggesting a strong preference.\n\n7. If they switch to rock as a counter to my rock, paper would be my best response (+3).\n\n8. If they switch to paper to beat my rock, scissors would be my best response (+1).\n\n9. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, rock would continue to be effective (+1).\n\n10. Since they've mostly alternated between scissors and rock recently, with a stronger preference for scissors, they might switch to rock after just losing with scissors.\n\n11. Given their historical pattern of often switching after a loss and their second-most common move being rock, they're likely to play rock next.\n\n12.

My current score: +6 - 1 = +5 points after another loss.\n\n4. Critical observations:\n   - My opponent has played scissors in 3 consecutive rounds\n   - They've played scissors in 5 of the last 7 rounds\n   - Every time I've played paper in recent rounds (14, 17, 19, 21), they've played scissors\n   - My opponent seems to strongly anticipate when I'll play paper\n   - Rock has been my most successful recent move\n\n5. After winning with scissors against my paper again, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (extending their successful streak)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (which they've rarely used)\n\n6. Given their strong tendency to play scissors, especially against my paper moves, and their current 3-move scissors streak, scissors remains their most likely next move.\n\n7. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n8. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n10. While there's always a risk they might switch, their demonstrated pattern of favoring scissors (57% of all moves) and correctly anticipating my paper moves suggests they're likely to continue with scissors.\n\n11. I need to stop playing paper, as they seem to be anticipating this move exceptionally well.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, directly countering their established strong preference for scissors and breaking my pattern of alternating between rock and paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Full sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - Their last four moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times in a row\n   - Their overall frequency: scissors (13/22 = 59%), rock (7/22 = 32%), paper (2/22 = 9%)\n\n3. My current score: +5 + 1 = +6 points after another win.\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - My rock move has been highly successful against their strong scissors preference\n   - They've now played scissors in 13 out of 22 rounds (59%)\n   - Every time I've played rock in the last several rounds (20, 22), I've won\n   - They've now played scissors in 4 consecutive rounds, their longest streak\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock again, they might:\n   - Finally switch to rock (to counter my rock)\n   - Try paper (which they've rarely used but would beat my rock)\n   - Stubbornly continue with scissors (though this seems illogical after consecutive losses)\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after consecutive losses:\n   - When they lost with scissors in rounds 2 and 20, they continued with scissors\n   - They've generally been persistent with scissors despite losses\n   - Only after multiple consecutive losses have they typically switched\n\n7. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors (59% of moves) and their current 4-move streak with it, they're likely reaching a point where they'll finally switch, most likely to rock to counter my successful rock plays.\n\n8. If they switch to rock as predicted, paper would be my best response (+3).\n\n9. If they switch to paper, and I play paper, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, and I play paper, I lose (-1).\n\n11. This is a critical decision point - they must realize their scissors strategy is failing against my rock, and the logical counter would be for them to switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, anticipating they'll finally switch to rock after their scissors strategy has repeatedly failed against my rock moves.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "I need to make a significant strategic adjustment after repeatedly losing with paper against scissors.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Full sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - Their last five moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 5 times in a row\n   - Their overall frequency: scissors (14/23 = 61%), rock (7/23 = 30%), paper (2/23 = 9%)\n\n3. My current score: +6 - 1 = +5 points after yet another loss.\n\n4. Critical observations:\n   - My opponent has played scissors in EVERY round where I played paper recently (rounds 14, 17, 19, 21, 23)\n   - They've now played scissors 5 consecutive times, their longest streak\n   - They appear to be extremely stubborn with their scissors strategy\n   - Rock has consistently won against their scissors (rounds 2, 9, 12, 20, 22)\n   - My paper strategy has consistently failed against their scissors\n\n5. This suggests either:\n   - My opponent has determined I'll alternate rock and paper moves\n   - They can predict when I'll play paper with surprising accuracy\n   - They've committed to scissors as their dominant strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They're exhibiting extreme stubbornness despite losses\n\n6. After winning with scissors against my paper yet again, they might:\n   - Continue with their extremely successful scissors streak\n   - Finally switch to rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (to be unpredictable after establishing a strong pattern)\n\n7. However, given their unprecedented 5-move scissors streak and consistent success against my paper moves, they've shown remarkable commitment to scissors.\n\n8. If they continue with scissors, rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, and I play rock, we tie (0).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, and I play rock, I lose (-3).\n\n11. Given their extreme preference for scissors (61% of all moves) and their current 5-move streak, scissors remains their most likely move by far.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round, directly countering their established overwhelming preference for scissors and breaking the cycle of alternating between rock and paper that has been unsuccessful.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
