The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same move results in a tie with 0 points for both\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) if it wins, but scissors only loses 1 point if it loses to rock.\n\n4. Rock is a relatively safe choice - it can win 1 point or lose 3 points.\n\n5. Given that paper has the highest upside (3 points), many players might choose it in the first round, which would make scissors a good counter.\n\n6. However, since I have no information about the opponent, I'll go with the move that has the highest potential gain - paper.\n\n7. If my opponent plays rock, I'll gain 3 points. If they play scissors, I'll lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n8. The expected value seems favorable for choosing paper in the first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie with 0 points.\n\n2. This reveals some information - my opponent also chose the move with the highest potential gain (paper) in the first round.\n\n3. Given that we both played paper last time, I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to counter their expected paper) and play rock to counter that\n   - They might simply stick with paper again\n\n4. The most common pattern in RPS after a tie is for at least one player to switch moves.\n\n5. If I were to follow standard RPS psychology, scissors would be a natural follow-up to counter the opponent's potential repeated paper play.\n\n6. However, if my opponent is thinking one step ahead, they might play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n7. Since paper resulted in a tie last time, I should definitely change my strategy. The question is whether to go with rock or scissors.\n\n8. Looking at the payoffs again: if I play scissors and win, I get 1 point. If I play rock and win, I get 1 point. But if I lose with scissors, I lose only 1 point, whereas losing with rock costs me 3 points.\n\n9. The risk-to-reward ratio is better with scissors: potential gain of 1 point with a potential loss of 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors for this round, anticipating that my opponent might play paper again or at least expecting me to play paper again.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

In round 1, both players chose paper (tie).\n2. In round 2, both players chose scissors (tie).\n3. This suggests my opponent and I are thinking similarly or using similar logic.\n\n4. The progression so far has been paper \u2192 scissors. Following standard RPS patterns, the natural next move after scissors would be rock.\n\n5. My opponent might anticipate this and play paper to counter my expected rock play.\n\n6. However, they might also think I'll try to outthink them and stay with scissors, expecting them to play paper, in which case they'd play rock.\n\n7. This is becoming a recursive thinking pattern, which is typical in RPS games.\n\n8. Let me consider the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n\n9. Since our moves have aligned twice, there's a possibility our thinking continues to align. If we both follow the natural progression, we'd both play rock.\n\n10. However, I can try to break this pattern by anticipating they'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\n11. Paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) if it wins against rock, and a relatively small loss (1 point) if it loses to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, predicting my opponent will choose rock following the natural progression from scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n2. Round 2: Both chose scissors (tie)\n3. Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost 1 point)\n\n2. The pattern of my opponent's moves has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   My moves have been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. This suggests my opponent decided to stick with scissors in round 3, breaking the pattern we both followed in rounds 1-2.\n\n4. My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row. This could mean:\n   - They've found a pattern they like and might continue with scissors\n   - They're aware that continuing with the same move is predictable, so they may switch\n   - They might be using a strategy of repeating moves that win for them\n\n5. If they continue with scissors for a third time, rock would be my best counter.\n\n6. If they anticipate my rock play and switch to paper, I would lose 3 points.\n\n7. If they switch to rock (completing the typical RPS cycle), and I play rock, we'd tie.\n\n8. Given that my opponent has played scissors twice in a row and just won with it, there's a psychological tendency to stick with winning moves.\n\n9. Looking at the risk-reward: \n   - Rock beats scissors: I gain 1 point\n   - Rock loses to paper: I lose 3 points\n   - Rock ties with rock: 0 points\n\n10. Despite the risk of losing 3 points if they switch to paper, I believe the highest probability is that they'll play scissors again or rock. Rock would be effective against scissors and neutral against rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round, anticipating my opponent might play scissors again or possibly switch to rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score tally is: +3 (win) + 1 (win) - 1 (loss) - 3 (loss) - 1 (loss) - 1 (loss) = -2 points\n\n9. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n\n10. Given their tendency to play what beats my previous move, and that I just played scissors, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play, based on their apparent strategy of playing what would beat my previous move. The risk-reward is favorable: potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 3 points if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score total: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -1 = -1 points\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n\n5. Interesting pattern: In rounds 9-10, my opponent played rock-scissors, which is a common RPS sequence.\n\n6. Looking at their full pattern, they've never played paper after scissors. After playing scissors, they've played either rock or scissors again.\n\n7. If they continue with the natural RPS progression, after scissors they might play paper.\n\n8. However, it's also possible they might anticipate that I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), in which case they'd play scissors.\n\n9. I notice my opponent has played scissors in rounds 2, 3, 7, and now 10. This suggests scissors might be their preferred move when uncertain.\n\n10. After losing with scissors in round 10, they might avoid it and play either rock or paper.\n\n11. Looking at the payoff structure and our history:\n    - I've won twice with rock (against scissors)\n    - I've won once with paper (against rock)\n    - I've never won with scissors\n\n12. Given that I just won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again, and counter with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play (either following RPS progression or trying to counter my expected rock). The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the pattern suggests they may avoid immediate repetition of moves after losing.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   My moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. This is our 4th tie in the game. We've tied with paper twice and scissors twice.\n\n4. Looking at the sequence after our previous ties:\n   - After tie with paper in Round 1: both played scissors\n   - After tie with scissors in Round 2: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - After tie with paper in Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n5. After the tie with scissors in Round 2, my opponent played scissors again in Round 3. They've just played scissors twice in a row (Rounds 10-11), so they might play scissors a third time.\n\n6. In RPS psychology, after a tie with scissors, the natural progression is for players to play rock next.\n\n7. If my opponent follows this progression, they'll play rock. However, they might anticipate I'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played scissors 5 times, rock 4 times, and paper 2 times. They seem to favor scissors most.\n\n9. Looking at what has historically followed their scissors plays:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - So after scissors, they've played scissors twice and paper once\n\n10. Given the payoff structure and our history, if I anticipate they'll play scissors again or rock, my best move would be rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would beat scissors if they repeat it a third time (which they've done before), and would also be the natural progression in RPS psychology after a scissors tie. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but based on their history, they play scissors more frequently than paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After our tie with scissors in Round 11, my opponent played paper in Round 12, breaking the common RPS progression (which would be rock after scissors).\n\n6. I notice my opponent has played paper in rounds 1, 4, 8, and now 12. Looking at what follows their paper plays:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - In 2 out of 3 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n7. After playing paper in Round 12, they might follow their most common pattern and play rock next.\n\n8. My opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my moves recently - they countered my rock with paper last round.\n\n9. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent never played the same move more than twice consecutively.\n\n10. The payoff structure reminds me that:\n    - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n    - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n    - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n11. If I expect them to play rock (following their pattern after paper), scissors would be my best counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. While scissors would counter their potential rock play, paper would be effective against rock too (with a higher point gain), and would tie if they play paper again. My reasoning is that after losing with paper, they may avoid it or try to counter my expected scissors play with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they follow their most common pattern, they'll play scissors next after their rock.\n\n8. Given our competitive history, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper again (since it just won), and counter with scissors.\n\n9. If they expect me to switch to scissors (to counter their expected scissors), they might play rock.\n\n10. Looking at the payoff structure:\n    - If they play scissors as predicted, rock would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), paper would work best\n    - If they play paper (anticipating my rock), scissors would work best\n\n11. Considering they've played scissors most frequently (5 times), followed by rock (5 times) and paper (3 times), and just lost with rock, scissors seems their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play based on their historical pattern after rock. Rock has worked well for me before against their scissors, and the risk-reward is favorable at this point.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I notice a pattern in rounds 12-14: my opponent has gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, while I've gone rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n6. Their last two moves (rock \u2192 paper) constitute a standard RPS progression. If they continue this progression, they would play scissors next.\n\n7.

My opponent has played more paper recently (rounds 12 and 14), which is a shift from their earlier preference for scissors and rock.\n\n9. They might expect me to avoid rock (since I've lost with it twice recently) and play scissors to counter their expected paper, in which case they might play rock.\n\n10. They also might anticipate I'll play paper (to break my rock-paper-rock pattern), and play scissors to counter.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and recent history, scissors would counter their potential paper play and also align with breaking my own pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper again (which they did in 2 of the last 3 rounds), and would break my alternating rock-paper pattern. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the potential to gain 1 point against their possible paper play makes this a reasonable calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I notice a striking pattern in my opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which is the same pattern they showed in rounds 12-14 but reversed (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n6. Looking at their full sequence, my opponent seems to alternate somewhat predictably between paper and rock in the later rounds:\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: rock  \n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: rock\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they might play paper next.\n\n8. I've lost several recent rounds, suggesting my opponent may be successfully anticipating my moves or I'm falling into predictable patterns.\n\n9. Looking at my own sequence, I've played rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 12-15.\n\n10.

This would counter their rock if they play it again, and their scissors if they decide to switch to that move. While it would lose to scissors, they haven't played scissors in the last 5 rounds, making it less likely. Their alternating pattern suggests paper might be next, but given my recent losses, I'm anticipating they might play rock again to exploit my expected move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   My moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My current score is still -4 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n\n5. My opponent broke their alternating paper-rock pattern in round 16 by playing paper again after rock.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 ?\n\n7. After our previous paper ties, there's no consistent pattern from my opponent.\n\n8. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often move to scissors.\n\n9. My opponent has played paper in rounds 12, 14, and 16 recently. After playing paper in round 12, they played rock in round 13. After playing paper in round 14, they played rock in round 15.\n\n10. Based on their historical pattern after paper plays, they might play rock next.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play scissors (the natural counter to paper), and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n12. Since we both just played paper, and their pattern suggests rock often follows their paper play, scissors would be risky.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter their potential scissors play (if they follow standard RPS psychology after a tie) and would tie if they play rock as their historical pattern suggests. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper again, but given they just played paper and their tendency to switch after paper, this seems less likely.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score remains -4 points after another tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n\n5. We're now seeing consecutive ties, which suggests we might be thinking similarly or following similar logic patterns.\n\n6. Looking at what follows rock ties historically:\n   - This is our first rock tie in the game.\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with rock, players often move to paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played rock in rounds 15 and 17 recently. Prior to that, they played rock in rounds 13, 9, 6, and 5.\n\n9. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 ?\n   - In 2 out of 5 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 other cases, they played paper\n\n10. Their more recent pattern after rock has been to play paper (rounds 14 and 16).\n\n11. In the current flow of the game, we've had paper tie \u2192 rock tie. If traditional RPS psychology holds, the next logical move would be paper to beat rock, but since we both just played rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n12. Given the payoff structure, recent game flow, and my opponent's historical patterns:\n    - If they play paper (following standard progression after rock tie), scissors would counter\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would counter\n    - If they play rock again, paper would counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This aligns with the natural progression after a rock tie, would beat rock if they play it a third time, and has the highest potential point gain (3 points). The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but based on the game flow and their historical patterns, paper seems the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n\n5. After our rock tie in Round 17, they played scissors in Round 18, which deviates from the standard RPS progression (paper would typically follow rock).\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern, they played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 16-18, which is a full RPS cycle.\n\n7. If they continue this cycling pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Looking at what follows their scissors plays historically:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R3) \u2192 Paper (R4)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - Scissors (R11) \u2192 Paper (R12)\n   - Scissors (R18) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 5 cases, they played paper after scissors\n\n9. Their most common follow-up to scissors has been paper, but they've also repeated scissors or played rock.\n\n10. Given that I just lost with paper against their scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock next (to counter their scissors), and respond with paper.\n\n11. Looking at the overall game, my opponent has been successful at anticipating my moves recently.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as suggested by their cycling pattern, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play paper as their historical pattern after scissors suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter if they repeat scissors (which they've done before) and would align with breaking the pattern of my recent losses. While it would lose to paper, paper seems less likely based on their recent cycling pattern. The rock choice balances potential gain against risk in the current game context.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n\n5. I've lost the last two rounds, and my opponent has successfully countered my moves both times.\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern, they've played rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in rounds 17-19, which is a full RPS cycle in the standard order.\n\n7. If they continue this cycling pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Looking at what follows their paper plays historically:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 ?\n   - In 5 out of 6 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. Their most consistent pattern has been to play rock after paper, which aligns with the cycling pattern observed in rounds 17-19.\n\n10. Given that I just lost with rock against their paper, they might anticipate I'll play paper next (to counter their paper), and respond with scissors.\n\n11. However, if they follow their strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper, scissors would lose.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and my recent losses:\n    - If they play rock as both their cycling pattern and historical pattern after paper suggest, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors anticipating my paper, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat paper, scissors would counter (1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.

My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 = -5 points (improved from -8)\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n\n5. My prediction from last round was correct - they did play rock after paper, following their strongest historical pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves, they've played scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in rounds 18-20, which is a full RPS cycle in reverse order.\n\n7. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 6 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 cases, paper\n\n8. Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper, but scissors is their most common follow-up (3 out of 6 times).\n\n9. Given that I just won with paper against their rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper again (since it worked), and respond with scissors.\n\n10. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they'll play scissors.\n\n11. If they continue their reverse cycling pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), they might play paper next.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and my recent win:\n    - If they play scissors as their historical pattern after rock suggests, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper as their reverse cycling pattern suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat rock, paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper (following their reverse cycling pattern) and would break the pattern of my paper-rock-paper sequence. While it would lose to rock if they repeat it, their historical pattern suggests scissors is more likely after rock. Given that they might anticipate I'll repeat paper after winning with it, scissors seems the most strategic choice to avoid being predictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at instances where they've played rock twice in a row:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21) \u2192 ?\n   - The only previous time they played rock twice, they followed with scissors.\n\n8. Looking at my own recent moves:\n   - Rock (R19) \u2192 Paper (R20) \u2192 Scissors (R21)\n   - I've been cycling through RPS in order, which could be predictable.\n\n9. After playing rock twice, they might:\n   - Continue with rock a third time (though this is rare in RPS)\n   - Switch to paper (following standard progression)\n   - Switch to scissors (as they did the only other time they played rock twice)\n\n10. If I were to follow my own pattern, I'd play rock next. They might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock a third time, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play paper, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\n12. Given that I've lost several times with scissors against rock, and they've now played rock twice in a row, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter their rock if they play it a third time (with the highest potential gain of 3 points), and break my apparent cycling pattern. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but given their consistency with rock recently and the higher potential gain, paper is worth the calculated risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score remains -6 points after the tie.\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n\n5. My opponent switched from playing rock twice in a row to playing paper, resulting in our tie.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 Both rock (R17)\n   - Paper tie (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - After paper ties, we've seen scissors-scissors, scissors-rock, and rock-rock\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a paper tie, scissors is a common follow-up.\n\n8. Looking at my opponent's sequence after paper plays (not just ties):\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20)\n   - Paper (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - In 6 out of 7 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. Their most consistent pattern throughout the game has been to play rock after paper.\n\n10. If they follow this strong pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as their historical pattern strongly suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors following standard psychology after a paper tie, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper again, it would result in another tie\n\n12. Given their very strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper (6 out of 7 times), I'll prepare for that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again this round. While this goes against the standard expectation to switch moves after a tie, my opponent has shown a remarkably consistent pattern of playing rock after paper throughout the game. If they follow this pattern, I'll win 3 points. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but their historical consistency makes paper the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 -1 +3 = -3 points (improved from -6)\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n\n5. My prediction was correct - they did play rock after paper in round 23, continuing their strongest pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22) \u2192 Rock (R23)\n\n7. Looking at what follows after they play rock and I win with paper:\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They played rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 I won with paper \u2192 They will play ?\n   - Their responses have been inconsistent after losing to paper\n\n8. Looking at their pattern after playing rock historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 ?\n   - After rock, they've played scissors 3 times, paper 3 times, and rock 2 times\n\n9. Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper.\n\n10. I've now played paper twice in a row and won both times. They might strongly expect me to play paper again, which would lead them to play scissors.\n\n11. If they follow the standard RPS psychology of not repeating the same move after losing, they'll play either scissors or paper instead of rock.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and recent game flow:\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my repeated paper), rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper (as they've done after rock 3 times), scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play rock again (as they've done after rock 2 times), paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. Given that I've won with paper twice in a row, they're very likely to anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors. Rock would beat their scissors if they follow this logic. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but given the psychology of the game after my repeated paper plays, scissors seems their most likely response.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given this tendency and the payoff structure, playing paper would give me the highest expected value if my opponent plays rock (+3).\n\n6. The risk is that if my opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point, which is less severe than the 3 points I would lose if I played rock and they played paper.\n\n7.

Alternatively, if my opponent thinks I'll anticipate their switch to scissors and play rock instead, they might choose paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n6.

I've now won three consecutive rounds by accurately predicting my opponent's moves.\n\n3. There appears to be a pattern in my opponent's play: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This suggests they might play rock next, following their pattern.\n\n4. However, after three consecutive losses, my opponent is likely aware they're being predicted successfully and may try to break their pattern.\n\n5. Players who have lost multiple times often attempt one of two strategies:\n   - Break their pattern completely and play unpredictably\n   - Try to analyze and anticipate their opponent's next move more carefully\n\n6. If my opponent realizes I've been countering them successfully, they might try to \"think one level deeper\" and anticipate my next counter.\n\n7. Since I played rock last round, they might expect me to play paper this round (as I've been making optimal counters).\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors to counter it.\n\n9. Therefore, if I believe they'll try to counter my expected paper with scissors, I should play rock again.\n\n10. However, there's also a chance they revert to a simpler strategy and just play what would beat my last move (paper beats my rock).\n\n11.

My opponent has now played: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which doesn't show an obvious pattern.\n\n4. After winning, players often stick with their successful strategy. My opponent may play paper again after it just gave them a significant win (+3).\n\n5. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll counter their paper with scissors, so they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n6. I need to consider the psychology after my first loss:\n   - I might be expected to switch to what would have beaten their move (scissors)\n   - I might be expected to stick with my previous move out of stubbornness (rock)\n   - I might try to be unpredictable by playing what they just played (paper)\n\n7. If my opponent expects me to play scissors to counter their paper, they would play rock.\n\n8. Given the significant swing in points (from winning to a big loss), and considering my opponent's adaptation, I should avoid being predictable.\n\n9. The safest play against an opponent who's showing adaptation is to play scissors, which:\n   - Counters paper if they repeat their winning move\n   - Loses minimally (-1) to rock if they anticipate my scissors\n   - If they play scissors too, we tie (0 points)\n\n10.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They've now played rock in rounds 12 and 14.\n\n3. After losing with rock against my paper, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat what beat them)\n   - Avoid repeating rock (as it just lost)\n   - Possibly play paper (if they think I'll anticipate scissors and play rock)\n\n4. Looking at their previous responses after losses:\n   - After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in rounds 5 and 9, they played rock both times\n   - After losing with rock in round 12, they played rock again (repeating)\n\n5. This last observation is important - after losing with rock in round 12, they unexpectedly played rock again in round 14, breaking their usual pattern of switching after losses.\n\n6. However, losing with the same move twice in a row (rock) makes it very unlikely they'll play it a third time.\n\n7. They've shown adaptability throughout the game but might be trying to establish a new pattern to confuse me.\n\n8. Based on traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology and their behavior, scissors seems most likely as it directly counters my winning paper move.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n10. Given their unpredictability but the strong psychological tendency to counter a winning move, I believe scissors is their most probable next choice.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Looking at their previous responses after losses:\n   - After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in rounds 5 and 9, they played rock both times\n   - After losing with rock in round 12, they played rock again (repeated)\n   - After losing with rock in round 14, they played scissors\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to play rock after losses, especially after losing with scissors, though their last few moves have been less predictable.\n\n7. I've won the last two rounds and four of the last five. They might be feeling pressure to break my winning streak with a less predictable move.\n\n8.

Looking at their previous responses after ties:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played scissors\n   - After scissors tie in round 2, they played paper\n   - After paper tie in round 8, they played scissors\n   - After scissors tie in round 11, they played rock\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to play scissors after paper ties (rounds 1 and 8).\n\n7. I haven't won after a tie yet in this game, so improving my performance after ties could be valuable.\n\n8.

We've now had six ties in the game, with the latest being rock vs rock.\n\n3.

There's no clear pattern in how they respond to ties, though they've never repeated the same move after a tie.\n\n7. Based on common rock-paper-scissors psychology after a rock tie, paper seems like the most likely move from them.\n\n8. If I expect them to play paper, my best response would be scissors.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie, 0 points\n\n10. The expected value with scissors seems reasonable, and the potential loss is minimal (-1) compared to other options.\n\n11.

My prediction in the last round was correct. I expected scissors and they indeed played scissors.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They just played scissors.\n\n4. I've won the last round and 9 of the last 12 rounds, suggesting my predictions have been generally accurate.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to rock (to beat what would beat them)\n   - Avoid repeating scissors (as it just lost)\n   - Possibly play paper (if they think I'll anticipate rock and play paper)\n\n6. Looking at their previous responses after losing with scissors:\n   - After losing with scissors in rounds 5, 9, and 15, they played rock, rock, and paper\n\n7. Their most common response to losing with scissors has been to play rock (2 out of 3 times).\n\n8. Additionally, looking at the longer-term pattern, there's been somewhat of an alternating nature to recent moves, though not perfectly consistent.\n\n9. Based on their historical tendency after losing with scissors and traditional psychology, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n10. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3\n    - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose -1\n    - If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n12. The expected value with paper seems highest, given their historical tendency to play rock after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We've just had another tie with paper, our seventh tie overall.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They've now played paper in rounds 20 and 22.\n\n4. After a tie with paper, players often:\n   - Play scissors (to beat the tied paper move)\n   - Occasionally repeat paper (betting the opponent will switch)\n   - Rarely play rock (as it would lose to the expected scissors)\n\n5. Looking at their previous responses after paper ties:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played scissors\n   - After paper tie in round 8, they played scissors\n   - After paper tie in round 16, they played rock\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to play scissors after paper ties (2 out of 3 times).\n\n7. Based on common rock-paper-scissors psychology after a paper tie and their past behavior, scissors seems most likely as their response to our paper tie.\n\n8. If I expect them to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n10. The expected value with rock seems reasonable if scissors is indeed their most likely move, based on their historical pattern after paper ties.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've played paper three times in the last four rounds.\n\n4. I notice they've now played paper after a paper tie twice in a row (rounds 22 and 16), breaking their previous tendency to play scissors after paper ties.\n\n5. After winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper since it was successful\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock, thinking I'll try to counter their expected scissors\n\n6. Looking at their responses after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in rounds 6 and 20, they played rock and scissors\n\n7. There's no clear pattern in how they respond after winning with paper.\n\n8. Given they've played paper three times in the last four rounds, I think they're unlikely to play paper again, as that would be too predictable.\n\n9. Their most recent pattern suggests they might play scissors next, especially if they anticipate I'll play paper to counter their paper.\n\n10. If I expect them to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n    - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n    - If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n12. While there's a risk of them playing paper again, their recent heavy use of paper makes scissors more likely as they try to anticipate my adjustment.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is an asymmetric scoring system where paper beating rock has the highest payoff.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, with no prior information, each move has equal expected value.\n\n5. However, with this scoring system, paper has potentially higher upside (+3) with same downside (-1) as other moves.\n\n6. Paper is a strategically attractive first move because:\n   - If opponent plays rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7.

Scissors can win against paper for +1, and only risks a -1 loss against rock.\n\n6. Given this is the first move with no information about my opponent, I should balance potential gain and risk.\n\n7.

Given that paper has the highest upside (3 points), many players might choose it in the first round, which would make scissors a good counter.\n\n6.

If I play rock:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to play paper again), I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock (also changing strategies), it's another tie\n   - If they play paper (anticipating I might switch to rock), I lose 3 points\n\n6. If I play scissors:\n   - If they play paper again, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n7. If I play paper again:\n   - If they play paper again, it's a tie\n   - If they play rock, I win 3 points\n   - If they play scissors, I lose 1 point\n\n8. Given that they played paper in the first round, and many players tend to switch after a tie, scissors seems like a reasonable counter-strategy.\n\n9. The risk with scissors is relatively low (only -1 if I lose), and there's a good chance to win if they play paper again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n",
        "I need to decide on my next move after the tie in the first round where both players chose paper.\n\nSteps:\n1. In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie with 0 points.\n\n2. This reveals some information - my opponent also chose the move with the highest potential gain (paper) in the first round.\n\n3. Given that we both played paper last time, I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (to counter their expected paper) and play rock to counter that\n   - They might simply stick with paper again\n\n4. The most common pattern in RPS after a tie is for at least one player to switch moves.\n\n5. If I were to follow standard RPS psychology, scissors would be a natural follow-up to counter the opponent's potential repeated paper play.\n\n6. However, if my opponent is thinking one step ahead, they might play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n7. Since paper resulted in a tie last time, I should definitely change my strategy. The question is whether to go with rock or scissors.\n\n8. Looking at the payoffs again: if I play scissors and win, I get 1 point. If I play rock and win, I get 1 point. But if I lose with scissors, I lose only 1 point, whereas losing with rock costs me 3 points.\n\n9. The risk-to-reward ratio is better with scissors: potential gain of 1 point with a potential loss of 1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors for this round, anticipating that my opponent might play paper again or at least expecting me to play paper again.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

There are a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I'll change my move\n   - They might switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper again\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\n4. Looking at the game theory, many players tend to shift their move after a tie.\n\n5. If they expect me to play paper again, they would likely switch to scissors.\n\n6. If they switch to scissors, my best response would be rock (which beats scissors).\n\n7. By playing rock, I would:\n   - Win 1 point if they play scissors\n   - Lose 3 points if they play paper again\n   - Tie if they also switch to rock\n\n8. Since they've shown a preference for paper in the first round, and the high payoff of paper is attractive, there's a decent chance they might stick with it.\n\n9. However, the most common move after a tie is to switch to what would have beaten the previous move, which would be scissors in this case.\n\n10. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter the likely scissors move from my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

This reveals information: my opponent chose paper in the first round, perhaps for similar reasoning as mine (the high reward potential).\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they might do next after our tie. There are several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I'll change my strategy\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, so they might switch to rock\n   - They might switch to scissors themselves, expecting me to play paper again\n\n4. In Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamics, players often shift after a tie. The opponent might be thinking I'll play paper again or switch to scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent sticks with paper, scissors would be my best move (win 1 point).\n   If my opponent switches to rock, paper would be my best move (win 3 points).\n   If my opponent switches to scissors, rock would be my best move (win 1 point).\n\n6. Given that the first round was a tie with paper, the opponent might expect me to switch. The most common next move after a tie is often to play what would have beaten the previous move.\n\n7. This suggests my opponent might play scissors to beat my previous paper. Therefore, rock would counter that effectively.\n\n8. Rock has a good risk-reward profile here: if they play scissors as predicted, I win 1 point; if they play paper again, I lose 3 points; if they play rock too, it's a tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next. There are several possibilities:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I'll change\n   - They might predict I'll play scissors to counter their previous paper, so they might play rock\n   - They might play scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n\n4. If I play paper again:\n   - Win (vs rock): +3 points\n   - Tie (vs paper): 0 points\n   - Loss (vs scissors): -1 point\n\n5.

Playing rock would be risky as it loses heavily to paper, but scissors seems like a reasonable move that balances risk and reward.\n\n9.

This suggests my opponent might be using similar reasoning to mine or could be purposely trying to match my moves.\n4. The pattern so far shows that both of us moved from paper to scissors, following typical RPS psychology (counter the previous move).\n5. Following that pattern, my opponent might expect me to play rock next (to counter the scissors from the last round).\n6. If they anticipate I'll play rock, they may play paper to counter it.\n7.

However, if they anticipate this thinking from me, they might play scissors instead.\n9. Looking at the history, we seem to be following similar reasoning patterns, which leads to ties.\n10. I need to break this cycle by choosing differently than the natural progression.\n11.

This could mean:\n   - They might avoid rock again\n   - They might finally use rock as a surprise\n   - They might be following a more complex strategy\n\n8. My opponent just played paper. Common RPS psychology suggests they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\n9. Given that they've successfully predicted my last two moves, I should avoid what seems like the obvious next move (scissors to counter their paper).\n\n10. Instead, I'll play paper again - a less expected move that would:\n    - Beat rock if they finally decide to play it\n    - Tie with paper if they stick with it\n    - Lose only 1 point to scissors if they try to counter my expected scissors play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round, attempting to break the pattern and potentially catch my opponent off-guard.\n\n[move] paper\n",

My opponent has now completed a full cycle back to paper. This could indicate they're using a deliberate pattern or successfully reading my moves.\n\n4. My total score is now -4 points, so I need to improve my strategy.\n\n5. If my opponent is trying to anticipate my next move, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper from the last round.\n\n6. If they anticipate scissors, they might play rock.\n\n7. However, they might also be using a pattern. If they're cycling through moves, after paper would come scissors.\n\n8. Since I've been losing, I should try to break any patterns I've established and potentially catch my opponent off guard.\n\n9. Looking at the risk-reward of each move:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie, 0 points\n\n10. Scissors has a balanced risk-reward profile (can win or lose 1 point), and it would counter their last move of paper.\n\n11.

If they're thinking one step ahead of me, they might anticipate I'll play scissors now to counter their paper.\n\n8. In which case, they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n9. But instead of trying to predict their move, I might be better off using the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, which is effective in these games. Since I lost with rock, I should shift.\n\n10. If I play paper and they play scissors again (anticipating my paper), I'd lose 1 point.\n    If I play scissors and they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'd lose 1 point.\n    The potential loss is the same, but scissors beats paper which they just played.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.

Their most recent move was rock. Following the pattern of RPS, the natural counter to rock is paper.\n\n6. However, if they're truly anticipating my moves, they might expect me to play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n7. Given that I've lost three consecutive rounds, I need to break out of this losing pattern.\n\n8. One strategy in RPS when facing a winning opponent is to play the move that would have lost to your previous move, as opponents often play what would have beaten your last move.\n\n9. My last move was scissors. The move that would have lost to scissors is paper. So my opponent might expect me to play rock (which beats scissors).\n\n10.

Looking more closely at recent rounds:\n   - In Round 5, they played rock (which beats my scissors)\n   - In Round 6, they played rock again (which loses to my paper)\n\n5. It's possible they've shifted strategy and are now repeating moves more frequently.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might revert to their earlier strategy of playing what beats my previous move.\n\n7. If they follow the strategy of beating my previous move, since I just played paper, they would play scissors.\n\n8. I need to anticipate both possibilities: either they continue playing rock for a third time, or they switch to scissors to counter my paper.\n\n9. Considering the payoffs:\n   - If they play rock again: paper would win me 3 points\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock would win me 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors would win me 1 point\n\n10. Given that they've repeated rock twice now and I just won with paper, they're most likely to switch to scissors to counter my expected paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play, and would tie if they somehow switch to rock again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's last three moves have been: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   This suggests they finally broke their streak of playing rock and switched to scissors.\n\n4. Looking at our game, there's a new potential pattern emerging: my opponent might be playing what I played in the previous round:\n   - In round 6, I played scissors in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n   - In round 7, I played paper in round 6, they played scissors in round 7 (not paper, but scissors beats paper)\n\n5. If this pattern holds, since I just played rock, they might play rock next.\n\n6. However, they've lost two rounds in a row now and might be changing their strategy altogether.\n\n7. Another possibility is that they might play paper, expecting me to play rock again (since I just won with it).\n\n8. I've won with both paper and rock in the last two rounds, so I might be tempted to continue with one of those moves.\n\n9. Considering psychological factors:\n   - After two consecutive wins, I might be expected to be confident and stick with rock\n   - My opponent has lost twice and might be more aggressive or unpredictable\n\n10. Looking at the payoffs and recent history:\n    - If they're playing what I played in the previous round, they'll play rock\n    - If they're trying to counter my expected rock play, they'll play paper\n    - If they're completely changing strategy due to losses, it's harder to predict\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This counters rock (which they might play if following my previous move), and gives the highest potential gain (3 points) if I win.

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played rock\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors\n\n4. My opponent switched from rock to scissors in the last round. This could indicate:\n   - They anticipated I would play paper again (which worked well for me in round 6)\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern after losing with rock\n\n5. If they're following a reactive strategy, after losing to my rock with scissors, they might play rock to counter what they think I'll play next.\n\n6. Looking at my recent winning streak:\n   - I won with paper against rock\n   - I won with rock against scissors\n   - The logical progression in RPS would be scissors next\n\n7. However, if my opponent anticipates this progression, they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n8. Another possibility is that they might expect me to stick with rock since it just won. In that case, they would play paper.\n\n9. Reviewing the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock: win 3, lose 3\n   - Rock beats scissors: win 1, lose 1\n   - Scissors beats paper: win 1, lose 1\n\n10. Since I've just won with rock against scissors, sticking with rock would only work if they play scissors again, which is unlikely.\n\n11. If they play rock (to counter my expected scissors) or paper (to counter my expected rock), paper would be my best option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.

After playing rock twice in rounds 5-6, my opponent switched to scissors in round 7.\n\n4. Looking at my last three moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), I've completed an RPS cycle. My opponent might anticipate that I'll start this cycle again with scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent thinks I'll play scissors, they would play rock to counter.\n\n6. Another pattern is that we've each won after a streak of the other player winning. They won rounds 3-5, then I won rounds 6-7.\n\n7. My opponent might be getting frustrated after losing consecutive rounds and could make a more aggressive move.\n\n8. Looking at their recent behavior, they've been switching moves more frequently now: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors.\n\n9. Since I just won with rock against their scissors, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper.\n\n10. Alternatively, they could think I'll anticipate their paper and play scissors, so they might play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n11. Considering the payoff matrix again:\n    - Paper beats rock: +3 points\n    - Scissors beats paper: +1 point\n    - Rock beats scissors: +1 point\n\n12. Given that I just won with rock, playing the same move would be predictable. Since my opponent has been adapting, they likely won't play scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round. This would beat rock if they switch to that (giving me 3 points), and would lose to scissors if they repeat scissors (costing me 1 point). Based on psychological patterns in RPS, people rarely play the same move after losing with it, so I think rock or paper from them is more likely than scissors again.\n\n[move] paper\n",

After playing rock twice in rounds 5-6, my opponent switched to scissors in round 7.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's recent behavior, they've made several strategy shifts:\n   - Initially, they seemed to counter my previous moves\n   - Then they repeated rock twice\n   - Now they've switched to scissors\n\n5. My last two plays have been paper \u2192 rock, and I've won with both. My opponent might expect me to continue this winning pattern by playing scissors next.\n\n6. If they anticipate scissors, they might play rock to counter it.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might recognize that since I won with rock, I might play rock again (a common psychological tendency to stick with winning moves), in which case they'd play paper.\n\n8. Their overall pattern doesn't show strong predictability, so I need to focus on higher-level strategy rather than pattern matching.\n\n9. Considering the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (3 points).\n\n10. Given that I've won my last two rounds, I'm currently at a positive score. This might be a good time to make a safer play rather than risking a big loss.\n\n11. If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point. If they play rock, I lose 1 point. If they play scissors, it's a tie. This has the most balanced risk-reward profile.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. It's a measured approach that doesn't risk losing 3 points, while still giving me a chance to win.

A third possibility is they might revert to rock, thinking I'll play scissors expecting them to play paper.\n\n8. The most straightforward counter to my last move (rock) would be paper, so that's what a basic strategy would suggest they'll play.\n\n9. If they play paper, I should play scissors to counter.\n\n10.

After my two consecutive wins in rounds 6-7, they matched my move in round 8, resulting in a tie.\n\n7. Following a tie, players often switch to a different move.

Since we both played paper, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n   - Play rock, expecting me to switch to scissors\n   - Play paper again, hoping for another tie or expecting me to overthink\n\n7.

After our tie with paper, the standard RPS psychology would suggest that at least one of us might switch to scissors to counter the expected repeated paper play.\n\n6. My opponent might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors and play rock to counter.\n\n7. However, my opponent might also expect me to overthink and stay with paper, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n8. There have been three ties in this game so far, and each time both players made the same move. This suggests some level of similar thinking patterns between us.\n\n9.

We're seeing some interesting patterns emerge - there have been multiple ties where we both made the same move, suggesting we might be thinking similarly at times.\n\n6.

I notice my opponent has played rock quite frequently (3 times in the last 5 rounds).\n\n5. Looking at their last few moves:\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: rock\n   \n   This follows the standard RPS sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock).\n\n6. If my opponent continues this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might recognize that playing rock has worked well against me (winning twice, losing once), and stick with it.\n\n8. My own pattern in the last few rounds:\n   - Round 7: rock (won)\n   - Round 8: paper (tied)\n   - Round 9: scissors (lost)\n   \n   I've also been following the standard RPS sequence.\n\n9. My opponent might anticipate I'll play rock next (continuing the sequence) and counter with paper.\n\n10. My overall record is now: 2 wins, 4 losses, 3 ties. I should take some calculated risks to improve this.\n\n11. If I play paper and they play scissors (following their pattern), I lose 1 point.\n    If I play paper and they play rock (repeating their last move), I win 3 points.\n    If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie.\n\n12. If I play rock and they play scissors (following their pattern), I win 1 point.\n    If I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie.\n    If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would beat scissors if they follow the standard RPS sequence, and tie with rock if they repeat their last move. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but given their frequent use of rock and the pattern they've been following, I believe scissors or rock are more likely plays from them.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n\n4. My opponent has played rock in rounds 5, 6, and now 9, but not consecutively. They seem to return to rock after playing other moves.\n\n5. After our tie with paper in round 8, they played rock - which successfully countered my scissors.\n\n6. There seems to be a pattern where my opponent often plays what would beat my previous move:\n   - After I played paper in round 8, they played rock in round 9 (which would beat my previous paper if repeated)\n\n7. If this pattern continues, since I just played scissors, they might play paper (which would beat my scissors if repeated).\n\n8. My current score tally is: +3 (win) + 1 (win) - 1 (loss) - 3 (loss) - 1 (loss) - 1 (loss) = -2 points\n\n9. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n\n10. Given their tendency to play what beats my previous move, and that I just played scissors, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play, based on their apparent strategy of playing what would beat my previous move. The risk-reward is favorable: potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 3 points if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My opponent seems to have played rock multiple times, particularly when I've played scissors.\n\n5. It's interesting that they played rock after paper in the last round - this doesn't follow the standard RPS progression (which would be scissors).\n\n6. I notice that in rounds 5, 6, and 9, my opponent played rock. They seem to favor this move.\n\n7. If they continue to favor rock, paper would be my best counter.\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this and play scissors instead. But given their history, rock seems to be their fallback move.\n\n9. There's also a possibility that after winning with rock, they might stick with it.\n\n10. Looking at the payoff structure again:\n    - Paper beats rock: win 3, lose 3\n    - Rock beats scissors: win 1, lose 1\n    - Scissors beats paper: win 1, lose 1\n\n11. Since they've won with rock against my scissors, and they've played rock multiple times throughout the game, there's a decent chance they'll play rock again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.

Interestingly, my opponent has played rock multiple times when I've played scissors (rounds 5 and 9). This suggests they might be predicting my scissors plays effectively.\n\n5. Looking at what my opponent does after playing rock:\n   - After round 5 (rock), they played rock again\n   - After round 6 (rock), they played scissors\n   - Now they've played rock again in round 9\n\n6. My record shows 3 ties, 4 losses, and 2 wins.\n\n7. Since my opponent just played rock, they might:\n   - Follow with scissors (continuing the reverse RPS cycle)\n   - Play rock again (they've repeated rock before)\n   - Play paper (to counter if they expect me to play rock)\n\n8. If I believe they'll play scissors next (following their reverse cycle), I should play rock.\n   If I believe they'll play rock again, I should play paper.\n   If I believe they'll play paper, I should play scissors.\n\n9.

Looking at my opponent's overall strategy, they've shown an ability to counter my moves effectively, suggesting they might be anticipating my logical progressions.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.

It also represents breaking my own predictable pattern while acknowledging that paper (the obvious counter to their rock) might be too predictable after losing to rock.\n\n[move] rock\n",

There seems to be a pattern where after I play paper, my opponent tends to play rock or scissors (never paper) in the next round.\n\n7. Also, after I play scissors, they've consistently played rock.\n\n8. After ties (rounds 1, 2, and 8), there's no clear pattern in their response.\n\n9.

The safest move considering all these factors would be scissors, which would beat their paper if they follow the pattern of playing what loses to their previous move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This counters the paper I expect them to play based on their potential pattern of playing what would lose to their own previous move. The risk-reward is reasonable: potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current score remains -1 points after the tie.\n\n4. This is the fourth tie in the game, and the second time we've tied with scissors.\n\n5. Looking at the most recent rounds:\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n\n6. After a tie with scissors in Round 2, they played scissors again in Round 3.\n   After our most recent tie with scissors, they might follow a similar pattern.\n\n7. However, they've now played scissors twice in a row (Rounds 10-11), which they've only done with scissors before (Rounds 2-3) and rock (Rounds 5-6).\n\n8. In both previous cases when they repeated a move, they didn't play it a third time in a row.\n\n9. Following standard RPS psychology, rock often follows scissors.\n\n10. If they follow basic RPS strategy, they might play rock to counter the expectation that I'll play scissors again.\n\n11. If I play paper, I beat their rock (if they play it) and tie their paper (if they switch to that), but lose to scissors if they play it a third time.\n\n12. If I play rock, I tie their rock, lose to their paper, and beat their scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This counters scissors if they play it a third time, ties with rock if they follow the typical scissors-to-rock progression, and only loses to paper. Given their historical patterns and the recent tie with scissors, rock seems to offer the best risk-reward balance.\n\n[move] rock\n",

This is our 4th tie in the game. We've tied with paper twice and scissors twice.\n\n4. Looking at the sequence after our previous ties:\n   - After tie with paper in Round 1: both played scissors\n   - After tie with scissors in Round 2: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - After tie with paper in Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock\n\n5. After the tie with scissors in Round 2, my opponent played scissors again in Round 3. They've just played scissors twice in a row (Rounds 10-11), so they might play scissors a third time.\n\n6. In RPS psychology, after a tie with scissors, the natural progression is for players to play rock next.\n\n7. If my opponent follows this progression, they'll play rock. However, they might anticipate I'll play rock and counter with paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played scissors 5 times, rock 4 times, and paper 2 times. They seem to favor scissors most.\n\n9. Looking at what has historically followed their scissors plays:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - So after scissors, they've played scissors twice and paper once\n\n10. Given the payoff structure and our history, if I anticipate they'll play scissors again or rock, my best move would be rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would beat scissors if they repeat it a third time (which they've done before), and would also be the natural progression in RPS psychology after a scissors tie. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but based on their history, they play scissors more frequently than paper.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After ties in this game, what has happened next?\n   - After tie in Round 1 (both paper), we both played scissors\n   - After tie in Round 2 (both scissors), I played paper, they played scissors\n   - After tie in Round 8 (both paper), I played scissors, they played rock\n\n6. My opponent has now played scissors twice in a row. Previously, when they repeated moves (scissors in rounds 2-3, rock in rounds 5-6), they switched to a different move afterward.\n\n7. Following typical RPS psychology, after scissors, the natural progression would be rock.\n\n8. However, since we both played scissors and tied, they might anticipate me playing rock and counter with paper.\n\n9. Looking at the pattern when we both played the same move:\n   - After both playing paper in Round 1, they played scissors\n   - After both playing scissors in Round 2, they played scissors again\n   - After both playing paper in Round 8, they played rock\n\n10. There's no clear pattern after ties, but they have sometimes continued with the same move.\n\n11. Given that they've now played scissors twice in a row, I think they're likely to switch to either paper or rock. Rock would be the natural RPS progression, but paper would counter my expected rock.\n\n12. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n    If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n    If they play scissors again, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This continues the natural RPS progression after scissors and would win against scissors if they play it a third time. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but after two consecutive scissors plays, them switching to rock seems more likely than paper based on typical RPS psychology.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Following a tie with scissors in round 2, my opponent played scissors again in round 3.\n   Following a tie with paper in round 8, my opponent played rock in round 9.\n   Now we've had a tie with scissors in round 11.\n\n6. My opponent has played scissors three times in the last five rounds (rounds 7, 10, and 11).\n\n7. In RPS psychology, the natural follow-up to scissors is often rock (to break the pattern).\n\n8. However, my opponent has also shown a tendency to repeat scissors (they played it consecutively in rounds 2-3 and 10-11).\n\n9. If they follow the standard progression, they'll play rock next. If they repeat their pattern of sometimes repeating moves after a tie, they might play scissors again.\n\n10. If I think they'll play rock, I should play paper.\n    If I think they'll play scissors again, I should play rock.\n    If I think they'll play paper (to counter expected rock), I should play scissors.\n\n11. Given their history of occasionally repeating scissors and the standard RPS progression suggesting rock as the next move after scissors, rock seems to be the safest option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would win against scissors (if they repeat it) and tie with rock (if they follow standard progression). The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper, but their pattern shows scissors-paper transition is less common for them.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My opponent played scissors twice in a row now (rounds 10-11). This is the third time they've repeated a move (scissors in rounds 2-3, rock in rounds 5-6).\n\n6. After the tie with both of us playing scissors, the standard RPS psychology suggests rock as the next logical move.\n\n7. However, my opponent might anticipate this and play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n8. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After tie in round 1 (paper), they played scissors in round 2\n   - After tie in round 2 (scissors), they played scissors again in round 3\n   - After tie in round 8 (paper), they played rock in round 9\n\n9. There's no consistent pattern in how they play after ties, though they did repeat scissors after our scissors tie in round 2.\n\n10. If they expect me to follow standard RPS progression (scissors \u2192 rock), they might play paper.\n\n11. If they continue their pattern of sometimes repeating moves, they might play scissors a third time.\n\n12. Given the payoff structure, rock would be safer against potential scissors (win 1, lose 3), while paper would be better against potential rock (win 3, lose 1).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This decision balances several factors: it would beat rock (the standard progression after scissors), it offers the highest potential gain (3 points), and the loss if wrong is minimal (1 point).

If they follow their previous pattern after playing paper, they might play rock in this round.\n\n10. Given that they just beat my rock with paper, they might continue with paper expecting me to play rock again, or they might switch to scissors anticipating I'll play paper.\n\n11.

After our tie with scissors in Round 11, my opponent played paper in Round 12, breaking the common RPS progression (which would be rock after scissors).\n\n6. I notice my opponent has played paper in rounds 1, 4, 8, and now 12. Looking at what follows their paper plays:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - In 2 out of 3 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n7. After playing paper in Round 12, they might follow their most common pattern and play rock next.\n\n8. My opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my moves recently - they countered my rock with paper last round.\n\n9. Looking at the overall pattern, my opponent never played the same move more than twice consecutively.\n\n10. The payoff structure reminds me that:\n    - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n    - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n    - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n11. If I expect them to play rock (following their pattern after paper), scissors would be my best counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. While scissors would counter their potential rock play, paper would be effective against rock too (with a higher point gain), and would tie if they play paper again. My reasoning is that after losing with paper, they may avoid it or try to counter my expected scissors play with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n",

My current score total: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -1 -3 = -4 points\n\n4. Looking at the patterns in my opponent's moves:\n   - After playing scissors twice in rounds 10-11, they switched to paper in round 12\n   - When they've played paper in the past (rounds 1, 4, 8, now 12), they've followed with scissors twice, paper once, and now we need to predict\n\n5. I notice they've played paper in rounds 1, 4, 8, and 12 - roughly every 4 rounds. After paper in round 8, they played rock in round 9.\n\n6. In RPS psychology, after playing paper successfully, a common follow-up is to stick with paper or switch to scissors (anticipating the opponent will play paper to counter their paper).\n\n7. My opponent seems to avoid playing the same move three times in a row, so after scissors-scissors-paper, they'll likely play either rock or scissors next.\n\n8. If I were to think about what beats my previous move (rock), they might play paper again. However, they rarely repeat moves immediately.\n\n9. Looking at the payoff structure again:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n\n10. Given that they just played paper and won significantly (3 points), they might be tempted to play paper again.\n\n11. However, based on their pattern of rarely repeating moves, they're more likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper again, and would tie if they play scissors. Given their pattern of switching moves after a win and their low frequency of playing rock after paper, scissors seems to be the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They might expect me to play paper again since it just won, and counter with scissors.\n\n9. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to scissors (to counter their expected paper) and play rock to counter that.\n\n10. I've won twice with paper against rock (+3 each), once with rock against scissors (+1), and never with scissors.\n\n11. Looking at the recent sequence, our game has been quite dynamic with few obvious repeating patterns, suggesting my opponent is adapting to my moves.\n\n12. The previous rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ? sequence in rounds 9-11 was followed by scissors (both players).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. Since I just won with paper, my opponent might expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors. By playing scissors myself, I would tie if they play scissors or win if they play paper. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, which they have played after rock before, but the potential to break a pattern they might be expecting seems worth it.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n\n5. My pattern prediction was incorrect - after rock in Round 13, they played paper in Round 14, not scissors.\n\n6. I notice an interesting pattern in the last 3 rounds: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This is similar to what happened in rounds 3-5: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their full sequence, I notice they've never played the same move three times in a row.\n\n8. Their recent paper play in Round 14 is significant - they've beaten me with paper against rock twice in a row (Rounds 12 and 14).\n\n9. Looking at what tends to follow their paper plays:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 4 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n10. If they follow their most common pattern, they'll play rock next after their paper.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect rock and play paper, in which case they might play scissors.\n\n12. I need to break out of predictable patterns, as my opponent seems to be anticipating my moves successfully.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter the expected paper if they continue their pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, and would also work if they play paper again. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but I need to break the pattern where they've successfully countered my rock twice in a row.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

I notice an interesting pattern in the last three rounds:\n   - Round 12: They played paper\n   - Round 13: They played rock\n   - Round 14: They played paper\n   This suggests they may be alternating between paper and rock.\n\n6. Another pattern I notice is that when I play the same move twice in recent rounds, they counter it the second time:\n   - I played rock in R12, lost, then played rock again in R14 and lost again\n   - This suggests they might be watching for repeated patterns in my play\n\n7. Looking at their overall sequence, my opponent hasn't played scissors in the last 3 rounds. Given they've played scissors 5 times in total, they might return to it soon.\n\n8. After playing paper, historically they've followed with:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - In 3 out of 4 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. If they follow their most common pattern, they'll play rock next after their paper.\n\n10. If I anticipate them playing rock, my best counter would be paper.\n\n11. However, they might also expect me to play paper (to counter their expected rock) and play scissors to counter that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This disrupts any pattern they might be detecting in my play, anticipates they might play paper again (since it just worked for them), and would also work well if they try to anticipate my paper play with scissors. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the potential to win 1 point seems worth it at this point.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

I notice a pattern in rounds 12-14: my opponent has gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, while I've gone rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n6. Their last two moves (rock \u2192 paper) constitute a standard RPS progression. If they continue this progression, they would play scissors next.\n\n7.

My opponent has played more paper recently (rounds 12 and 14), which is a shift from their earlier preference for scissors and rock.\n\n9. They might expect me to avoid rock (since I've lost with it twice recently) and play scissors to counter their expected paper, in which case they might play rock.\n\n10. They also might anticipate I'll play paper (to break my rock-paper-rock pattern), and play scissors to counter.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and recent history, scissors would counter their potential paper play and also align with breaking my own pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper again (which they did in 2 of the last 3 rounds), and would break my alternating rock-paper pattern. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, but the potential to gain 1 point against their possible paper play makes this a reasonable calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Looking at their overall pattern, they've now played paper-rock-paper in rounds 12-14.\n\n7. I notice an interesting pattern: they seem to be countering my moves very effectively. In the last 7 rounds (8-14), they've beaten me 4 times, tied twice, and lost only once.\n\n8. If they're anticipating my moves well, they might expect me to play scissors next (to counter their paper).\n\n9. If they expect scissors from me, they would likely play rock.\n\n10. However, they've just played paper twice in the last three rounds, which is unusual for them. They might be developing a new pattern.\n\n11. Looking at their full sequence again, I don't see a consistent pattern in their play beyond generally not repeating the same move too many times.\n\n12. Since they've just played paper, they're likely to switch to either rock or scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This directly counters their paper from the last round, and given that they've played paper twice recently, they might play it again. The risk is losing 1 point if they play rock, which is less than the 3 points I've lost in recent rounds with rock against paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Given their balanced play and recent success in countering me, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n\n12. If they follow the RPS progression, after rock they might play paper.\n\n13. However, they might also anticipate I'll play paper to counter their expected rock repeat, and play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter if they play rock again or follow a pattern of repeating their last successful move. Paper gives me the highest potential gain (3 points) if successful, versus the potential loss of 1 point if they play scissors. Given my current score, I need the higher potential points gain to recover.\n\n[move] paper\n",

I notice a concerning pattern - my opponent seems to be anticipating my moves well:\n   - When I played rock, they played paper\n   - When I played scissors, they played rock\n   - When I played paper in Round 13, they played rock (which I won against)\n\n6. Their last three moves have been rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. This suggests they might continue this alternating pattern with paper next.\n\n7. Looking at their overall play history:\n   - They've played rock 6 times\n   - They've played paper 5 times\n   - They've played scissors 4 times\n\n8. What tends to follow their rock plays:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 ?\n\n9. In the most recent instance, they followed rock with paper. If this pattern continues, they might play paper after their rock from Round 15.\n\n10. I've lost several times recently trying to predict their moves, which suggests they might be reading my strategy or I'm being too predictable.\n\n11. Looking at my own moves, I've been cycling through rock, paper, and scissors somewhat predictably.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This breaks my recent pattern and would win against rock if they play it again, but would lose against scissors if they anticipate my paper. Given their recent tendency to alternate between rock and paper, I think paper has a good chance against their potential rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n\n5. I notice a striking pattern in my opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which is the same pattern they showed in rounds 12-14 but reversed (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper).\n\n6. Looking at their full sequence, my opponent seems to alternate somewhat predictably between paper and rock in the later rounds:\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: rock  \n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: rock\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they might play paper next.\n\n8. I've lost several recent rounds, suggesting my opponent may be successfully anticipating my moves or I'm falling into predictable patterns.\n\n9. Looking at my own sequence, I've played rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 12-15.\n\n10. Considering the payoff structure and recent history:\n    - If they play paper as predicted by their alternating pattern, scissors would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock again (breaking their pattern), paper would work best\n    - If they play scissors (which they haven't played recently), rock would work best\n\n11. Given that I've just lost with scissors against rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors and play paper or rock instead.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter their rock if they play it again, and their scissors if they decide to switch to that move. While it would lose to scissors, they haven't played scissors in the last 5 rounds, making it less likely. Their alternating pattern suggests paper might be next, but given my recent losses, I'm anticipating they might play rock again to exploit my expected move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After our previous paper ties, there's no consistent pattern from my opponent.\n\n8. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often move to scissors.\n\n9. My opponent has played paper in rounds 12, 14, and 16 recently. After playing paper in round 12, they played rock in round 13. After playing paper in round 14, they played rock in round 15.\n\n10. Based on their historical pattern after paper plays, they might play rock next.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play scissors (the natural counter to paper), and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n12. Since we both just played paper, and their pattern suggests rock often follows their paper play, scissors would be risky.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter their potential scissors play (if they follow standard RPS psychology after a tie) and would tie if they play rock as their historical pattern suggests. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper again, but given they just played paper and their tendency to switch after paper, this seems less likely.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After our previous paper ties, there was a tendency for scissors to be played, but with different outcomes.\n\n8. My opponent has now played paper twice in a row (R15-16), which breaks their previous alternating pattern.\n\n9. In RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, scissors is often the next move as players try to break the tie.\n\n10. If my opponent anticipates I'll play scissors (to break the paper tie), they might play rock.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and our history:\n    - If they play scissors (following common RPS psychology), rock would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), paper would work best\n    - If they play paper again, scissors would work best\n\n12. My opponent has shown they can be unpredictable, but also falls into patterns at times. The recent double paper play is new for them.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play to break our paper tie (following standard RPS psychology). It would also be effective if they continue their earlier alternating pattern and play scissors. The risk is losing 3 points if they play paper again, but three consecutive paper plays seems less likely.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My opponent's pattern in the last 3 rounds has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, continuing their alternating pattern.\n\n8. If they continue this alternation, they might play rock next.\n\n9. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often play scissors next.\n\n10. Looking at my opponent's overall pattern, they've played paper in rounds 1, 4, 8, 12, 14, and now 16.

The most common follow-up to their paper has been rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. In standard RPS psychology, scissors often follows paper after a tie. Additionally, if my opponent plays scissors (which they've done after a paper tie before), we'd tie again. If they continue their alternating pattern and play rock next (their most common move after paper), I would lose 1 point - but this is a manageable risk compared to the potential gain of 1 point if they play paper again.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

The alternating pattern I observed earlier (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) has continued with paper in round 16. If this pattern continues, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Given the psychological tendency in RPS to not repeat the same move after a tie, they're likely to play either rock or scissors.\n\n9. After our previous paper ties:\n   - After paper tie (R1): they played scissors\n   - After paper tie (R8): they played rock\n\n10. Considering the payoff structure and my overall losing record, I need to break predictable patterns while making a strategic choice.\n\n11. If they expect me to play scissors (the natural counter to our tied paper move), they might play rock. If they expect me to play rock (to counter their expected scissors), they might play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter their potential scissors play (which they used after our first paper tie), and align with breaking predictable patterns. While it would lose to paper, I'm calculating that they're more likely to play scissors or rock based on our tie history and their overall move distribution.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After the previous paper-paper ties, either both of us switched to scissors or one of us did. This suggests scissors might be a common follow-up to a paper tie.\n\n8. If my opponent follows this historical pattern, they might play scissors or rock next.\n\n9. Looking at their overall pattern in recent rounds, they were alternating paper and rock. The tie with paper might cause them to break this pattern.\n\n10. In RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, scissors is a common next move.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and our history:\n    - If they play scissors (following typical RPS progression), rock would be my best counter\n    - If they play rock (continuing their alternating pattern but skipping paper), paper would be best\n    - If they play paper again (repeating their move), scissors would be best\n\n12. Considering they might be observing my patterns too, and I've recently played scissors \u2192 paper, they might expect me to play rock next and counter with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play (following natural RPS progression after a paper tie). While it would lose to paper, I'm calculating that the psychological tendency to play scissors after a paper tie will prevail over their recent alternating pattern. This is a calculated risk with a potential gain of 1 point versus a potential loss of 3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n\n5. We're now seeing consecutive ties, which suggests we might be thinking similarly or following similar logic patterns.\n\n6. Looking at what follows rock ties historically:\n   - This is our first rock tie in the game.\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with rock, players often move to paper.\n\n8. My opponent has played rock in rounds 15 and 17 recently. Prior to that, they played rock in rounds 13, 9, 6, and 5.\n\n9. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 ?\n   - In 2 out of 5 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 other cases, they played paper\n\n10. Their more recent pattern after rock has been to play paper (rounds 14 and 16).\n\n11. In the current flow of the game, we've had paper tie \u2192 rock tie. If traditional RPS psychology holds, the next logical move would be paper to beat rock, but since we both just played rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n12. Given the payoff structure, recent game flow, and my opponent's historical patterns:\n    - If they play paper (following standard progression after rock tie), scissors would counter\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would counter\n    - If they play rock again, paper would counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This aligns with the natural progression after a rock tie, would beat rock if they play it a third time, and has the highest potential point gain (3 points). The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but based on the game flow and their historical patterns, paper seems the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n",

We've now had back-to-back ties with paper and then rock.\n\n6. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with rock, players often move to paper.\n\n7. Looking at what follows rock ties historically, this is our first rock tie in the game.\n\n8. Their overall pattern has featured several alternating sequences between paper and rock in later rounds.\n\n9. Recently, we've seen:\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: paper  \n   - Round 17: rock\n\n10. If they continue this alternating pattern, paper would be their next move.\n\n11. If they follow standard RPS psychology after a tie with rock, they would also play paper.\n\n12. Both patterns suggest paper as their most likely next move.\n\n13. Looking at my own recent moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), I seem to be following the RPS cycle in reverse. If I continue this pattern, I would play scissors next, but that would be risky against their expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter their expected paper play (which both their alternating pattern and standard RPS psychology suggest). While this is risky if they break their pattern and play rock again, the consistency of their recent alternating suggests paper is highly likely. Since I need to make up points, taking a calculated risk with scissors to gain 1 point against their expected paper seems worthwhile.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

They might also anticipate that I'll play paper (the natural counter to rock after a tie), and play scissors to counter my paper.\n\n11. Looking at the overall trend, we're experiencing more ties recently, suggesting our thinking processes might be aligning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This follows the natural RPS progression after a rock tie, and would counter their rock if they play it again. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but given their historical pattern of following rock with paper more recently, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n",

In round 15 it was preceded by paper in round 14, and in round 17 it was preceded by paper in round 16.\n\n9. Their playing rock in round 17 was consistent with their pattern of often playing rock after paper.\n\n10. Given that we just had a tie with rock, and following standard RPS progression, paper would be a natural next move for both of us.\n\n11. If my opponent anticipates I'll play paper, they might counter with scissors.\n\n12. However, looking at their historical pattern, after playing rock they've often played scissors (rounds 7, 10) or paper (rounds 14), but not consistently.\n\n13. We've had 6 ties in 17 rounds, suggesting we think similarly at times. This increases the likelihood they might play paper after a rock tie, following standard RPS psychology.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter the paper I expect them to play (following standard RPS progression after a rock tie). While it would lose to rock if they play it again, their historical pattern suggests they rarely play the same move three times in a row. The risk-reward ratio (potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 1 point) is also balanced.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

However, they might also anticipate that I'll play paper (the natural counter to rock), and play scissors to counter my anticipated paper.\n\n11.

This follows the standard RPS progression after a rock tie, would win against rock if they play it a third time, and aligns with their historical tendency to not play the same move three times in a row.

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 16: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n\n5. After our rock tie in Round 17, they played scissors in Round 18, which deviates from the standard RPS progression (paper would typically follow rock).\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern, they played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 16-18, which is a full RPS cycle.\n\n7. If they continue this cycling pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n8. Looking at what follows their scissors plays historically:\n   - Scissors (R2) \u2192 Scissors (R3)\n   - Scissors (R3) \u2192 Paper (R4)\n   - Scissors (R7) \u2192 Paper (R8)\n   - Scissors (R10) \u2192 Scissors (R11)\n   - Scissors (R11) \u2192 Paper (R12)\n   - Scissors (R18) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 5 cases, they played paper after scissors\n\n9. Their most common follow-up to scissors has been paper, but they've also repeated scissors or played rock.\n\n10. Given that I just lost with paper against their scissors, they might anticipate I'll play rock next (to counter their scissors), and respond with paper.\n\n11. Looking at the overall game, my opponent has been successful at anticipating my moves recently.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as suggested by their cycling pattern, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play paper as their historical pattern after scissors suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter if they repeat scissors (which they've done before) and would align with breaking the pattern of my recent losses. While it would lose to paper, paper seems less likely based on their recent cycling pattern. The rock choice balances potential gain against risk in the current game context.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After our rock tie in Round 17, my opponent played scissors, which successfully countered my paper.\n\n6. Looking at the pattern from rounds 16-18: paper tie \u2192 rock tie \u2192 they play scissors. This suggests they might be trying to anticipate and counter my moves.\n\n7. My opponent hasn't played the same move three times in a row throughout the game. Their most recent moves were rock \u2192 scissors.\n\n8.

Their most common follow-up to scissors has been paper. \n\n10. Given standard RPS psychology, after playing scissors, players often play rock (to beat the expected paper response).\n\n11. I've lost several recent rounds, suggesting my opponent is effectively anticipating my moves. I need to break any detectable pattern.\n\n12. Given the payoff structure and recent history:\n    - If they play paper (their historical pattern after scissors), scissors would counter\n    - If they play rock (standard progression after scissors), paper would counter\n    - If they play scissors again, rock would counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter if they play scissors again or follow the psychological tendency to play scissors after winning with it. Rock has a favorable risk-reward ratio in this situation - potential gain of 1 point versus potential loss of 3 points if they play paper, but their historical pattern and recent game flow make paper less likely as their next move.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After our rock tie, my opponent played scissors, breaking the common RPS progression (which would be paper after rock).\n\n6. I notice that my opponent has now played scissors 6 times, rock 6 times, and paper 6 times - a perfectly balanced distribution overall.\n\n7. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   This shows they're varying their moves significantly.\n\n8.

In standard RPS psychology, after scissors, the natural progression is rock.\n\n10. My opponent seems to have detected that I would play paper after our rock tie (following standard progression) and successfully countered with scissors.\n\n11. Given that I just lost with paper against scissors, they might anticipate that I'll play rock next to counter their scissors.\n\n12. If they anticipate rock, they might play paper. However, if they continue with their most common pattern after scissors, they would play paper anyway.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter their potential paper play (which is both their most common move after scissors and a good counter to my expected rock). While this risks losing 1 point if they play rock, it could gain 1 point against paper. Given their balanced distribution of moves and tendency to play paper after scissors, this seems like a calculated risk worth taking.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their strongest pattern in the game has been playing rock after paper. If this pattern holds, they'll likely play rock next.\n\n7.

My sequence of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in rounds 17-19 has been predictable and unsuccessful. I need to break this pattern.\n\n11.

If I attempt to counter their expected rock with paper, they might anticipate this and play scissors instead.\n\n10. Looking at my recent moves, I've played paper \u2192 rock in rounds 18-19. If I play scissors next, that would complete a standard RPS cycle, which might be predictable.\n\n11. Given the payoff structure and our history:\n    - If they play rock as their historical pattern suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors anticipating my paper, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper again, scissors would counter (1 point)\n\n12. I need to break out of the losing pattern. Their most consistent behavior has been playing rock after paper, but they might be anticipating my response to that pattern now.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.

My opponent played scissors \u2192 paper in the last two rounds. After playing scissors in Round 18, they played paper in Round 19, which aligns with their historical tendency (3 out of 5 times they played paper after scissors).\n\n6.

There's a strong pattern where my opponent plays rock after paper. Based on this, they're likely to play rock next.\n\n8. I've lost several consecutive rounds, suggesting my opponent is successfully anticipating my moves.\n\n9. Looking at my recent play pattern, I've gone paper \u2192 rock in the last two rounds.

Considering the payoff structure and my opponent's patterns:\n    - If they play rock as their historical pattern strongly suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat paper, scissors would counter (1 point)\n\n11. Given my opponent's strong historical tendency to play rock after paper, and my need to break my losing streak, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter the rock I strongly expect them to play based on their consistent historical pattern after paper. While it would lose to scissors, their pattern of playing rock after paper has been very consistent (5 out of 6 cases).\n\n[move] paper\n",

However, if they follow their strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper, scissors would lose.\n\n12.

Their historical pattern of playing rock after paper is their strongest pattern in the game (5 out of 6 times), and it also aligns with their recent cycling pattern.

My prediction from the last round was correct - they did play rock after paper, following their strongest historical pattern.\n\n6. Their recent sequence has now been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in rounds 18-20.\n\n7.

Scissors is their most common follow-up to rock, but they've also played paper after rock twice in the more recent rounds.\n\n9. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they'll play scissors next.\n\n10. After I won with paper in round 13, they played paper in round 14. After I won with paper in round 6, they played scissors in round 7.\n\n11.

Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 ?\n   - In 3 out of 6 cases, they played scissors after rock; in 2 cases, paper; in 1 case, rock again\n\n8. There's no overwhelmingly consistent pattern following their rock plays, but scissors is slightly more common.\n\n9. Looking at what happens after I win with paper against their rock:\n   - I won with paper in Round 6, then played rock in Round 7, they played scissors (I won)\n   - I won with paper in Round 13, then played rock in Round 14, they played paper (I lost)\n   - I won with paper in Round 20, now deciding Round 21...\n\n10. After my paper wins, my opponent has played both scissors and paper when I followed up with rock.\n\n11. Given their slightly higher tendency to play scissors after rock, and considering the reverse RPS cycle they've shown in rounds 18-20, scissors might be their next move.\n\n12. If I anticipate scissors, rock would be the counter. If they play paper instead, I would lose 3 points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. While rock would counter their potential scissors play, scissors would counter if they play paper (which they've done after rock in 2 cases). Additionally, scissors would break the pattern of my repeated paper play, making me less predictable. Given their varied responses after rock, and my need to recover points, I'll take this calculated risk.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

My prediction from last round was correct - they did play rock after paper, following their strongest historical pattern.\n\n6. Looking at their recent moves, they've played scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock in rounds 18-20, which is a full RPS cycle in reverse order.\n\n7.

Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper, but scissors is their most common follow-up (3 out of 6 times).\n\n9. Given that I just won with paper against their rock, they might anticipate I'll play paper again (since it worked), and respond with scissors.\n\n10. If they follow their most common pattern after rock, they'll play scissors.\n\n11. If they continue their reverse cycling pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), they might play paper next.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure and my recent win:\n    - If they play scissors as their historical pattern after rock suggests, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper as their reverse cycling pattern suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat rock, paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This would counter if they play paper (following their reverse cycling pattern) and would break the pattern of my paper-rock-paper sequence. While it would lose to rock if they repeat it, their historical pattern suggests scissors is more likely after rock. Given that they might anticipate I'll repeat paper after winning with it, scissors seems the most strategic choice to avoid being predictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their longer pattern of play:\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - This suggests they might be establishing a new pattern or responding to my moves differently.\n\n7.

If I were to follow my own pattern, I'd play rock next. They might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n11.

Given that I've lost several times with scissors against rock, and they've now played rock twice in a row, paper seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.

My opponent has played rock twice in a row (rounds 20-21). This is only the second time in the game they've repeated a move (they played scissors twice in rounds 2-3 and 10-11).\n\n6. When they've repeated moves before:\n   - After scissors twice (R2-3), they played paper (R4)\n   - After scissors twice (R10-11), they played paper (R12)\n   - This suggests that after playing rock twice, they might play paper next\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern lately:\n   - Rounds 15-21: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - There's no obvious cycling pattern, but they've been playing rock frequently (4 of the last 7 moves)\n\n8. Given that they've just played rock twice in a row, they'll likely change to either paper or scissors. Based on their historical pattern after repeating moves, paper seems more likely.\n\n9. Looking at what happens after I lose with scissors against rock (which has happened in rounds 5, 9, 15, and now 21):\n   - After R5: I played paper in R6 and won\n   - After R9: I played rock in R10 and won\n   - After R15: I played paper in R16 and tied\n   - This suggests paper or rock could be effective after this particular loss scenario\n\n10.

Given that they've played rock twice in a row (which they rarely do), and their historical pattern suggests paper follows after they repeat moves, I'm betting that they'll either play paper (resulting in a tie) or continue with rock (giving me a win with 3 points).

I've lost with scissors against their rock twice in a row now (rounds 15 and 21), which suggests they might be recognizing when I'm likely to play scissors.\n\n10.

This would counter their rock if they play it a third time (which would give me the highest point gain of 3), and would break the pattern of my recent rock-paper-scissors cycle.

My current score: +3 +1 +1 -1 -3 -1 -3 +3 -3 -1 -1 -3 +3 -1 = -6 points\n\n4. Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, they chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n\n5. My opponent has played rock twice in a row now (rounds 20-21), breaking their previous patterns.\n\n6. Looking at their rock plays historically:\n   - They've now played rock in rounds 5-6, 9, 13, 15, 17, 20-21\n   - This is the first time they've played rock three times in a row\n\n7. Looking at what follows their rock-rock sequence:\n   - This is the first time they've played rock twice in a row, so no historical pattern\n\n8. I've lost with scissors against rock in rounds 5, 9, 15, and now 21. This suggests my opponent might be anticipating when I'll play scissors and countering with rock.\n\n9. Given that they've played rock twice in a row now, they might:\n   - Continue with rock a third time if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their rock\n\n10. Looking at my own recent moves (paper \u2192 scissors), I might be expected to play rock next following RPS psychology.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure and recent game flow:\n    - If they play rock a third time, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they switch to paper, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they switch to scissors, rock would counter (1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round. This would counter their rock if they play it a third time, giving me the maximum potential gain (3 points). While it would lose to scissors, given their double rock play and my losses with scissors against rock, paper seems the most strategic move at this point. My opponent seems to be successfully anticipating my scissors plays, so paper is the higher-value counter to their apparent preference for rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent switched from playing rock twice in a row to playing paper, resulting in our tie.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 Both rock (R17)\n   - Paper tie (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - After paper ties, we've seen scissors-scissors, scissors-rock, and rock-rock\n\n7. In standard RPS psychology, after a paper tie, scissors is a common follow-up.\n\n8. Looking at my opponent's sequence after paper plays (not just ties):\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20)\n   - Paper (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - In 6 out of 7 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n9. Their most consistent pattern throughout the game has been to play rock after paper.\n\n10. If they follow this strong pattern, they'll play rock next.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as their historical pattern strongly suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors following standard psychology after a paper tie, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper again, it would result in another tie\n\n12. Given their very strong historical pattern of playing rock after paper (6 out of 7 times), I'll prepare for that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again this round. While this goes against the standard expectation to switch moves after a tie, my opponent has shown a remarkably consistent pattern of playing rock after paper throughout the game. If they follow this pattern, I'll win 3 points. The risk is losing 1 point if they play scissors, but their historical consistency makes paper the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper\n",

After playing rock twice in rounds 20-21, my opponent switched to paper in round 22.\n\n6. Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 Both rock (R17)\n   - Paper tie (R22) \u2192 ?\n\n7. After our previous paper ties, there's been a tendency toward scissors (from me) and rock/scissors from them.\n\n8. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often move to scissors.\n\n9. Looking at my opponent's overall pattern after ties:\n   - After ties, they've played scissors twice, rock once, and paper once\n\n10. My opponent has shown adaptability and the ability to anticipate my moves. They may expect me to play scissors after our paper tie, following standard RPS psychology.\n\n11. If they anticipate scissors from me, they might play rock to counter.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play rock as predicted, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors (following standard progression after paper), rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they repeat paper, we tie again (0 points)\n\n13. Given that rock has been their most played move in recent rounds (4 out of the last 6 rounds), playing paper would be risky.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter if they play scissors (which is the standard progression after a paper tie) and would break the apparent pattern they might be observing. While it would lose to paper if they repeat it, their historical preference for rock after paper ties and the overall game context suggests scissors or rock is more likely from them in this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Looking at what follows our paper ties historically:\n   - Paper tie (R1) \u2192 Both scissors (R2)\n   - Paper tie (R8) \u2192 I scissors, they rock (R9)\n   - Paper tie (R16) \u2192 Both rock (R17)\n   - Paper tie (R22) \u2192 ?\n\n7. After our previous paper ties, the pattern is inconsistent, but scissors has been played by at least one of us each time.\n\n8. In standard RPS psychology, after a tie with paper, players often move to scissors.\n\n9. Looking at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - Paper (R1) \u2192 Scissors (R2)\n   - Paper (R4) \u2192 Rock (R5)\n   - Paper (R8) \u2192 Rock (R9)\n   - Paper (R12) \u2192 Rock (R13)\n   - Paper (R14) \u2192 Rock (R15)\n   - Paper (R16) \u2192 Rock (R17)\n   - Paper (R19) \u2192 Rock (R20)\n   - Paper (R22) \u2192 ?\n   - In 6 out of 7 cases, they played rock after paper\n\n10. Their pattern of playing rock after paper has been extremely consistent throughout the game.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure and their strong historical pattern:\n    - If they play rock as their pattern suggests, paper would counter (3 points)\n    - If they play scissors (standard after a tie), rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper again, it would be another tie\n\n12. Given their very strong tendency to play rock after paper, and that this pattern has held throughout the game, scissors would be the logical counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round. This anticipates their likely rock play based on their strongest pattern in the entire game (playing rock after paper in 6 out of 7 instances). While there's a risk they'll break this pattern, their consistency makes scissors the most strategic choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I've now won with paper against rock twice recently (rounds 20 and 23), both confirming their strong pattern of playing rock after paper.\n\n6. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 ?\n   - After rock: scissors (3 times), paper (2 times), rock (2 times)\n\n7. Their pattern after rock is more varied, but scissors is still their most common follow-up (3 out of 8 times).\n\n8. However, looking at more recent patterns, they followed rock with paper in rounds 13-14, 15-16, and 21-22.\n\n9. I've now played paper twice in a row and won with it both times. My opponent might strongly anticipate I'll play paper a third time and counter with scissors.\n\n10. Considering my opponent's adaptability throughout the game, they may have noticed I've identified their \"rock after paper\" pattern and might change their strategy.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - If they play scissors as they might expect after my repeated paper plays, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper as their more recent pattern after rock suggests, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play rock again, paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. After two consecutive wins with paper, I expect my opponent to adapt and play scissors to counter my expected paper play. Rock would beat their scissors and continue building my comeback in terms of points. This also breaks my pattern of repeated paper plays, making me less predictable.\n\n[move] rock\n",

My prediction from last round was correct - they did play rock after paper, following their remarkably consistent pattern (now 7 out of 8 times).\n\n6.

Their pattern after rock is less consistent than their pattern after paper, but scissors is still their most common follow-up (3 out of 8 times).\n\n9. Given that I've won with paper twice recently and played it three times in my last four moves, they're likely to anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n10.

Since I've been successful with paper, they're likely expecting me to continue with it. Their most common move after rock is scissors, which would counter paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. This would counter the scissors I expect them to play based on both their historical pattern after rock and the tactical expectation that they'll try to counter my recent successful paper plays.

Given that I've won with paper twice in a row, they're very likely to anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors. Rock would beat their scissors if they follow this logic.

Looking at the last few rounds:\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 22: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, they chose rock (I won)\n\n5. I've played paper twice in a row now, winning the last round. My opponent once again played rock after paper, confirming their strongest pattern in the game (now 7 out of 8 times).\n\n6. Looking at what follows their rock plays historically:\n   - Rock (R5) \u2192 Rock (R6)\n   - Rock (R6) \u2192 Scissors (R7)\n   - Rock (R9) \u2192 Scissors (R10)\n   - Rock (R13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n   - Rock (R15) \u2192 Paper (R16)\n   - Rock (R17) \u2192 Scissors (R18)\n   - Rock (R20) \u2192 Rock (R21)\n   - Rock (R21) \u2192 Paper (R22)\n   - Rock (R23) \u2192 ?\n   - They've played scissors 3 times, paper 3 times, and rock once after rock\n\n7. Their pattern after rock is more variable, but scissors and paper are equally likely (3 times each).\n\n8. Given that I've won with paper twice recently (rounds 20 and 23), they might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n9. Since I've played paper twice in a row now, they might especially expect me to play paper a third time.\n\n10. My opponent has shown they can adapt and break patterns, as they did in round 22 when they played paper after my scissors, breaking their streak of playing rock.\n\n11. Considering the payoff structure and recent history:\n    - If they play scissors anticipating my paper, rock would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play paper following one of their patterns after rock, scissors would counter (1 point)\n    - If they play rock again, paper would counter (3 points)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round. I've won with paper twice recently and played it two rounds in a row, making it highly predictable that I might play paper again. My opponent likely anticipates this and will counter with scissors. Rock would beat their expected scissors, and given their adaptability and my recent success with paper, this seems to be the most strategic move to avoid being predictable.\n\n[move] rock\n"
