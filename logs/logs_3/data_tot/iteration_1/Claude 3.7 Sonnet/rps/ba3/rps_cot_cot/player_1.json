Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me review the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: tie, 0 points\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3) if wrong.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider what most players might choose initially.\n\n4. Many players choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\n5. Given this tendency and the payoff structure, playing paper would give me the highest expected value if my opponent plays rock (+3).\n\n6. The risk is that if my opponent plays scissors, I lose only 1 point, which is less severe than the 3 points I would lose if I played rock and they played paper.\n\n7. Paper therefore has the best risk-reward profile for an initial move: potential for highest gain (+3) with minimal potential loss (-1).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

In the previous round, both my opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie (0 points).\n\n2. Now I need to anticipate how my opponent might adjust their strategy after our tie.\n\n3. A common human tendency after revealing identical choices is to shift to a new move, thinking the other player will stick with the previous move or try to counter it.\n\n4. If my opponent thinks I'll play paper again, they might shift to scissors to beat me.\n\n5. Alternatively, if my opponent thinks I'll anticipate their switch to scissors and play rock instead, they might choose paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n6. Given these possibilities, I should consider what gives the best risk-reward ratio:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1\n\n7. Since scissors provides a chance to win +1 with only risking -1 (versus rock which risks -3), scissors seems to have the better risk profile for this round.\n\n8. Additionally, choosing scissors directly counters the previous shared choice (paper), which is psychologically sound if my opponent tends to repeat moves.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Following this pattern, one might expect rock to come next.\n\n5. If my opponent anticipates I'll play rock next, they might choose paper to counter it.\n\n6. However, they might also assume I'll try to break the pattern of ties by deliberately avoiding rock.\n\n7.

Rock would be a natural choice following the progression and would beat scissors if my opponent repeats their last move.\n\n9.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, continues to show adaptability without a simple pattern.\n\n3. I notice that my opponent has now played rock twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10), breaking their previous pattern of never repeating moves.\n\n4. After winning with rock against my scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Stick with rock since it was successful\n   - Switch to paper, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors, thinking I'll try to counter their expected paper\n\n5. Given that they've just repeated rock for the first time, this could indicate either:\n   - They've found a strategy they like (beating scissors with rock)\n   - They're deliberately breaking their own pattern to confuse me\n   - It was coincidental and they'll return to switching moves\n\n6. If they stick with rock a third time, paper would be my best response.\n\n7. If they switch to paper (anticipating my rock), scissors would be best.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper), rock would be best.\n\n9. I need to consider their most likely psychology. After successfully using rock twice (against my scissors in rounds 7 and 10), they may be developing confidence in this move.\n\n10. However, intelligent players rarely repeat the same move three times, as it becomes too predictable.\n\n11. Given their adaptability throughout the game, I think they're most likely to switch to paper, anticipating I'll counter their rock with paper.\n\n12. Therefore, my best move is scissors to counter their expected paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've switched from rock to scissors in the last round.\n\n4. After a tie with scissors, players often:\n   - Play rock (to beat the tied scissors move)\n   - Occasionally repeat scissors (betting the opponent will switch)\n   - Rarely play paper (as it would lose to the expected rock)\n\n5. The most probable move from my opponent would be rock, following the standard counter to a tie.\n\n6. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n7. However, my opponent has demonstrated high adaptability throughout, so they might anticipate this and play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they've been unpredictable but have shown a tendency to alternate between moves. After playing scissors, rock would be a logical next choice for them.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose -1\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n10. The potential gain with paper (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1), and it counters their most likely move (rock).\n\n11.

The most common response after losing is to play what would beat their opponent's previous move. Since I played paper, they would likely play scissors.\n\n5. My opponent has been adaptable but has shown some tendencies in their responses to losses. Examining their previous losses:\n   - After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in rounds 5 and 9, they played rock both times\n\n6. While past behavior doesn't guarantee future actions, their history suggests scissors is a strong possibility after losing with rock.\n\n7.

My prediction in the last round was correct. I expected paper and they indeed played paper.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They've shown variability throughout.\n\n4. After losing with paper against my scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to rock (to beat what beat them)\n   - Avoid repeating paper (as it just lost)\n   - Possibly play scissors (if they think I'll anticipate rock and play paper)\n\n5. Looking at their previous responses after losses:\n   - After losing with paper in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing with scissors in rounds 5, 9, and 15, they played rock, rock, and paper\n   - After losing with rock in rounds 12 and 14, they played rock and scissors\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to play rock after losing with paper (as in round 3), though their recent moves have been less predictable.\n\n7. I've now won 2 consecutive rounds and 7 of the last 10 rounds. They might be trying to break my successful prediction streak.\n\n8. Based on traditional psychology after a loss and their past behavior, rock seems most likely as their response to losing with paper.\n\n9. If I expect them to play rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3\n    - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose -1\n    - If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n11. The expected value with paper seems highest, given their historical tendency to play rock after losing with paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at their previous responses after losing with rock:\n   - After losing with rock in round 12, they played rock again\n   - After losing with rock in round 14, they played scissors\n\n7. They've been somewhat inconsistent after losing with rock, but the traditional strategy would be to play scissors to beat my paper.\n\n8. Additionally, they may have noticed I've been predicting their moves well and might try a less predictable approach.\n\n9. Given my recent success and their likely frustration after three consecutive losses, they might abandon patterns and play more unpredictably.\n\n10. Based on traditional psychology after losing with rock against paper and their past behavior, scissors seems most likely as their next move.\n\n11. If I expect them to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\n12.

I notice an interesting pattern in the last few rounds: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. There appears to be an alternating pattern developing.\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their expected scissors\n\n7. Given the emerging alternating pattern and traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology after a win, scissors seems most likely as their next move.\n\n8. If I expect them to play scissors, my best response would be rock.\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n10. While the alternating pattern suggests they might play rock next, their win with paper might encourage them to break the pattern. The psychological tendency to switch to scissors after winning with paper seems more compelling.\n\n11.

They've now played paper in rounds 20 and 22.\n\n4. After a tie with paper, players often:\n   - Play scissors (to beat the tied paper move)\n   - Occasionally repeat paper (betting the opponent will switch)\n   - Rarely play rock (as it would lose to the expected scissors)\n\n5. Looking at their previous responses after paper ties:\n   - After paper tie in round 1, they played scissors\n   - After paper tie in round 8, they played scissors\n   - After paper tie in round 16, they played rock\n\n6. They've shown a tendency to play scissors after paper ties (2 out of 3 times).\n\n7. Based on common rock-paper-scissors psychology after a paper tie and their past behavior, scissors seems most likely as their response to our paper tie.\n\n8.

They've played paper three times in the last four rounds.\n\n4. I notice they've now played paper after a paper tie twice in a row (rounds 22 and 16), breaking their previous tendency to play scissors after paper ties.\n\n5. After winning with paper against my rock, my opponent might:\n   - Stick with paper since it was successful\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock, thinking I'll try to counter their expected scissors\n\n6. Looking at their responses after winning with paper:\n   - After winning with paper in rounds 6 and 20, they played rock and scissors\n\n7. There's no clear pattern in how they respond after winning with paper.\n\n8. Given they've played paper three times in the last four rounds, I think they're unlikely to play paper again, as that would be too predictable.\n\n9. Their most recent pattern suggests they might play scissors next, especially if they anticipate I'll play paper to counter their paper.\n\n10.
