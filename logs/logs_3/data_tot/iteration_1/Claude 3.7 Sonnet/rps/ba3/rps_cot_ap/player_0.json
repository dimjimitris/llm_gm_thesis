Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I should consider the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I have no history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest potential penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n4. Rock and scissors have more modest rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\n5. For a first move with no prior information, I could choose randomly. However, since players often start with rock as their first move (a common human tendency), playing paper might be advantageous.\n\n6. Paper would win against rock giving me +3 points, and would lose to scissors giving me -1 points. This has a higher expected value than starting with rock or scissors if my opponent plays randomly or favors rock.\n\n7. The potential for higher gain (+3) outweighs the risk (-1) if my opponent plays scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the last round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, so I lost and received -1 points.\n\n2. This gives me one data point about my opponent's behavior - they started with scissors in the first round.\n\n3. There are several possibilities to consider:\n   - My opponent might stick with scissors since it worked last time\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors) and therefore switch to paper\n   - They might employ a completely different strategy\n\n4. If my opponent sticks with scissors, I should play rock to win (+1 points).\n   \n5. If my opponent switches to paper (anticipating my rock), I would lose with rock (-3 points).\n   \n6. If my opponent switches to rock (perhaps thinking I'll play scissors), I'd lose with scissors (-1 points) but win with paper (+3 points).\n\n7. Considering the most likely scenario and the risk/reward ratio, playing rock seems most reasonable:\n   - If they play scissors again, I win +1 points\n   - If they switch to paper, I lose -3 points\n   - If they switch to rock, we tie (0 points)\n\n8. Since my opponent already demonstrated willingness to play scissors, and players often repeat successful moves, rock gives me a good chance to win this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Based on their history:\n   - Their previous paper streak lasted exactly 5 rounds\n   - They've now played paper four times in this streak\n   - This suggests they might play paper exactly one more time to match their previous streak length\n\n5. My recent success:\n   - I've successfully played scissors against their paper twice in a row\n   - Despite losing, they've continued with paper\n   - This shows a strong commitment to completing their pattern regardless of outcome\n\n6. If they continue with paper for a fifth time, scissors would win again (+1 points)\n7. If they switch to rock (to counter my expected scissors), paper would win (+3 points)\n8. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (+1 points)\n\n9. Considering their demonstrated pattern consistency and apparent commitment to completing streaks of specific lengths, scissors remains the most logical choice.\n\n10. However, there's an increasing risk they'll finally adapt after losing twice in a row. If they're rational and pattern-based, they'll play paper one more time to complete a 5-move streak. If they're becoming more adaptive, they might switch to rock to counter my scissors.\n\n11. Given their strong historical pattern adherence even after losses, scissors is still the highest expected value play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent rounds summary:\n   - Round 16-19: Opponent played paper four times\n   - Round 20: Opponent switched to rock\n\n2. My opponent's complete move pattern:\n   - Round 1-2: scissors (twice)\n   - Round 3-4: paper (twice)\n   - Round 5-8: scissors (four times)\n   - Round 9-13: paper (five times)\n   - Round 14-15: scissors (twice)\n   - Round 16-19: paper (four times)\n   - Round 20: rock (breaking paper streak)\n\n3. They finally adapted after losing twice in a row to my scissors, breaking their paper streak at 4 moves (one short of their previous 5-move paper streak).\n\n4. This indicates:\n   - They're becoming more adaptive to my moves\n   - They're willing to break their pattern to counter my strategy\n   - They might be moving toward a more reactive play style\n\n5. Possible strategies they might employ next:\n   - Continue with rock if they expect me to play scissors again\n   - Switch back to paper, returning to their pattern\n   - Switch to scissors to try to surprise me\n\n6. If they play rock again, paper would win (+3 points)\n7. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (+1 points)\n8. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (+1 points)\n\n9. Given that they just successfully countered my scissors with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock since it worked last time\n   - Expect me to counter with paper and switch to scissors\n\n10. Weighing the options:\n    - Paper beats rock for a high reward (+3 points)\n    - If they anticipate this and play scissors, I would lose (-1 points)\n    - They've shown they're now willing to adapt to counter my moves\n\n11. Since they've demonstrated adaptation but have historically played in streaks, paper is the optimal move, betting they'll either continue with rock or return to their streak pattern with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is the first time they've played rock in our game, so there's no historical data on their rock streak length.\n\n6. If their rock streak follows their early pattern of playing moves twice before switching, they might switch next round.\n\n7. If their rock streak follows their later pattern of longer streaks (4-5 moves), they'll likely continue with rock.\n\n8.

If they continue with rock, paper would win again (+3 points)\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (+1 points)\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (+1 points)\n\n12.
