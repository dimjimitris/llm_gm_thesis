Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Consider the expected values:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-1)\n   - Rock has medium potential gain (+1) but the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Scissors has medium potential gain (+1) but medium potential loss (-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player:\n   - I don't have prior information about their tendencies\n   - Many players tend to choose rock in the first round as a default\n   - Paper would beat rock and give me the highest possible gain (+3)\n   - If they choose scissors instead, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they choose paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n4. The risk-reward ratio of choosing paper seems optimal for the first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for the first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Since my opponent won with scissors, there's a decent chance they might:\n   - Stick with scissors (many players repeat winning moves)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll counter with scissors)\n\n5.

Analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They started with scissors, then switched to rock\n   - This suggests they might be employing a clockwise rotation strategy in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would likely play paper next\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often switch moves\n   - My opponent has shown that they don't stick with the same move\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play paper to beat their rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options considering the opponent might play paper:\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, we tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point\n\n5.

Review what happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, we tied (0 points)\n   - Round 3-22: I won all rounds by predicting their moves correctly\n   - My current total: Won 20 consecutive rounds\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Their pattern has remained perfectly consistent through all 22 rounds\n   - The clockwise rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock) is absolutely established\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - I've won twenty rounds in a row by predicting their moves perfectly\n   - There is zero indication they will ever deviate from their pattern\n   - This is certainly a bot or a player committed to this rotation regardless of outcomes\n\n4. Evaluate my options considering the opponent will play rock:\n   - If I play rock and they play rock, we tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I win 3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point\n\n5. Paper is clearly the optimal move:\n   - It beats the predicted move (rock) with the highest possible gain (+3)\n   - Continues my winning streak\n   - Maximizes my point advantage\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

        "I need to determine the best first move for this rock-paper-scissors style game. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, I need to understand the point values. Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the points are asymmetric:\n   - Rock beating scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beating rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beating paper: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties: 0 points for both\n\n2.

Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (+3), but scissors has the lowest risk (-1 if I lose).\n\n4. Without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I should consider the expected value of each move:\n   - If I choose rock: I get +1 if opponent chooses scissors, 0 if rock, -3 if paper\n   - If I choose paper: I get +3 if opponent chooses rock, 0 if paper, -1 if scissors\n   - If I choose scissors: I get +1 if opponent chooses paper, 0 if scissors, -1 if rock\n\n5.

In terms of risk, losing with rock against paper is the worst outcome (-3), while losing with paper or scissors only costs -1.\n\n5. Without any knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what a typical first-time player might choose:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - If my opponent chooses rock, paper would give me the highest reward (+3)\n\n6.
