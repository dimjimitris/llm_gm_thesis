    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors where outcomes are symmetric, this variant has asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties result in 0 points for both\n\nThe expected value of each move assuming completely random play from the opponent:\n- Rock: (0 + -3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + -1)/3 = 2/3\n- Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nIn a single isolated round against a fresh opponent, paper has the highest expected value.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with the mathematical analysis. Paper is the dominant first-move strategy given the asymmetric payoff structure. The risk-reward ratio favors paper since winning with it provides the highest possible reward (+3), and losing with it only costs the standard penalty (-1). For a one-shot game against a fresh opponent who hasn't developed any pattern recognition about our play, paper offers the optimal expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh opponents in games like this often default to rock as their first move. This is a well-documented psychological tendency - rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors games. This psychological insight further supports choosing paper as our first move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is clear. Given both the mathematical expected value calculations and psychological factors, paper is the optimal first move. It offers the highest expected value (2/3 compared to -2/3 for rock and 0 for scissors), and it counters the most likely first move from a fresh opponent (rock). I'll choose paper as my first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me collaborate with my personas again.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting result - our opponent also chose paper in the first round. This could indicate several things:\n1. They independently arrived at the same game theory conclusion we did\n2. They're a sophisticated player who understands the asymmetric payoffs\n3. It could be coincidence\n\nLet's re-examine the expected values and consider what a rational opponent might do next. Given that they've shown some strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they may anticipate us switching to scissors to counter their paper. If they think we'll choose scissors, their best response would be rock (which beats scissors for +1/-1).\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with the analysis. Our opponent chose paper, which suggests they understand the payoff structure or followed the same psychological tendency many players have. Now they'll likely anticipate us switching to scissors to beat their paper. The natural counter to that would be rock.\n\nHowever, if they think we'll stick with paper (expecting them to switch to rock), they might choose scissors. This creates a classic mind game situation. Let's consider each option:\n- If we choose rock: We beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n- If we choose paper: We beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0) \n- If we choose scissors: We beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nPsychology Expert: This is now a psychological game of anticipation. The first round established that both players understand the optimal move. In the second round of RPS games, players often shift strategies, but in different ways. Less experienced players might stick with what worked (paper again) or switch to what would have beaten their previous choice (scissors). More sophisticated players try to get one step ahead.\n\nGiven that they chose paper initially (showing strategic awareness), there's a higher probability they'll anticipate our scissors and play rock. I recommend we stay with paper - it's counter-intuitive, but it would beat their likely rock play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is a compelling analysis. Our opponent demonstrated strategic awareness by choosing paper in the first round. They may now expect us to switch to scissors to counter their previous paper move, which would lead them to choose rock. If we anticipate this and stick with paper, we could achieve the highest possible gain (+3) against their rock.\n\nWhile there's always uncertainty in these predictions, the combination of game theory and psychological analysis suggests that staying with paper for this second round offers the best expected outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our prediction was correct - the opponent switched to rock, likely anticipating that we would switch to scissors. Now we need to consider what a rational opponent would do next after losing significantly (+3/-3 points). The opponent has now seen us play paper twice in a row - first as an optimal opening move, and then as a read on their strategy. \n\nAt this point, a rational opponent would strongly consider scissors as their next move to counter our apparent paper preference. The opponent is now down by 3 points and may be looking to change their strategy dramatically to recover.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. The psychological and strategic momentum has shifted. Our opponent has seen us use paper twice successfully and will almost certainly expect us to play paper a third time. They're likely to play scissors to counter this perceived pattern.\n\nGiven this analysis, we should switch to rock to counter their likely scissors play. This would give us another win, though with a smaller point gain (+1 instead of +3). The key insight is that while paper has the highest potential payoff, it's now too predictable after two consecutive uses.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is classic pattern recognition and adaptation in game theory. After losing 3 points, the opponent is psychologically primed to make a significant adjustment. They've observed us playing paper twice, which creates a strong expectation in their mind. \n\nPeople are generally poor random number generators - they tend to avoid repeating the same choice too many times, even when it would be strategically sound to do so. Our opponent will almost certainly play scissors now, thinking they've identified our pattern. Switching to rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis is convincing. After two consecutive paper plays (one resulting in a significant win for us), our opponent will most likely expect us to play paper again and counter with scissors. By switching to rock, we can anticipate this move and win the round.\n\nThis demonstrates a level-headed adaptation rather than getting locked into a successful but now predictable strategy. Rock is the optimal move for this third round based on both game theory and psychological analysis.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This puts them at a significant psychological disadvantage, down by 4 points total.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern so far:\n1. Round 1: Paper (us) vs Paper (them) - Tie\n2. Round 2: Paper (us) vs Rock (them) - We win +3\n3. Round 3: Rock (us) vs Scissors (them) - We win +1\n\nThe opponent has played Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, which is interesting as it forms a complete cycle through all three options. They may be trying to avoid being predictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: At this point, our opponent is likely frustrated after two consecutive losses. Players in this position typically do one of two things:\n1. They might try to \"reset\" their thinking and go back to what they consider the optimal move (paper, which has the highest potential gain)\n2. They might try to predict our next move based on our pattern\n\nOur pattern so far is Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. A simple pattern-matching algorithm would predict scissors as our next move. If they anticipate this, they would play rock.\n\nHowever, if they believe we're thinking at a deeper level, they might expect us to play rock again (as it worked last time) and counter with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive losses, the opponent is likely to change their approach completely. There's a psychological tendency called \"pattern breaking\" where players deliberately avoid continuing what seems like a losing strategy.\n\nGiven that they've now played all three options once (paper-rock-scissors), they might return to paper for two reasons: 1) It's objectively the strongest first move in this variant, and 2) It breaks any pattern we might be detecting.\n\nAdditionally, players who are behind tend to make higher-risk, higher-reward plays. Paper offers the highest potential gain (+3), which would help them recover their position more quickly.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This analysis suggests our opponent is most likely to play paper in this round. They've cycled through all three options once, they're significantly behind and may seek the highest reward move, and they might be trying to reset their strategy to the objectively optimal opening move.\n\nIf we anticipate paper from them, our best counter is scissors. While scissors only gives a +1 point advantage (compared to the +3 from paper beating rock), it's the safest play against our opponent's likely strategy. Playing rock would be risky as it would lose badly to their likely paper play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Players who are significantly behind often become either very predictable (falling into simple patterns) or very unpredictable (making random choices out of frustration).\n\nThe fact that they've now played Paper twice (first and fourth moves) suggests they might be anchoring on Paper as their preferred move, which makes sense given its higher potential reward. However, they've just lost with Paper, so they're unlikely to play it a third time.\n\nGiven their apparent rotation pattern and psychological state, they're most likely to play Rock next, thinking it will counter our expected Paper (if they believe we cycle back to our successful opening strategy).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, our opponent is most likely to play Rock in the next round. They appear to be following a rotation pattern, and psychologically, they would want to avoid repeating Paper after just losing with it.\n\nIf we expect Rock from them, our best counter would be Paper, which would give us the maximum +3 point advantage.

The pattern Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors is absolutely consistent. Given this unvarying pattern, their next move would be Rock, continuing their third cycle.\n\nStrategic Planner: At this point, the opponent's strategy is undeniable - they are rigidly following a rotation of Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors regardless of outcomes. They've maintained this pattern through seven consecutive rounds despite losing every time.\n\nGiven their unwavering commitment to this pattern, we can predict with very high confidence that they will play Rock next. The optimal counter to Rock is Paper, which would give us +3 points - the maximum possible gain in this game.\n\nWhile there's always a theoretical possibility they might suddenly change their strategy after seven losses, the pattern has been so consistent that making any other prediction would be contrary to all available evidence.\n\nPsychology Expert: After seven consecutive unsuccessful rounds, any strategically-minded human player would have broken their pattern. The fact that they haven't suggests either:\n1. This is an extremely simple computer program\n2. They're deliberately maintaining this pattern as some kind of experiment\n3. They're completely unaware of or unconcerned with the outcomes\n\nThe psychological expectation of pattern-breaking becomes less relevant when a player shows such unwavering commitment to a predetermined sequence. Their behavior suggests we should continue to expect strict adherence to their established pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on the opponent's perfect consistency across seven rounds, we can predict with extremely high confidence that they will play Rock next, continuing their established cycle of Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors.\n\nThe optimal counter to their expected Rock move is Paper, which will give us another +3 point advantage. While there's always a theoretical possibility they might break their pattern, their behavior has been so rigid through seven rounds that any other prediction would contradict all evidence we have.\n\nI'll choose Paper as our next move, expecting to encounter their Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"
