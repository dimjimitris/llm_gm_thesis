Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Many players tend to switch to a different move after a tie, rather than repeating.\n5. If my opponent follows this tendency, they might switch from paper to either rock or scissors.\n6. Between those two options, scissors is the more likely choice because it beats the previous move (paper).\n7. If they anticipate I'll play paper again, they'll likely choose scissors.\n8.

However, if my opponent is thinking at a higher level, they might anticipate this and choose rock again or go back to paper.\n6. Since we've played paper and rock already, but not scissors, there's a psychological tendency to complete the set.\n7. If they choose scissors next, I should play rock to win.\n8. If they expect me to play scissors and choose rock, I should play paper.\n9. Given the pattern of ties, it seems we're thinking similarly. Breaking this cycle requires a less predictable move.\n10.

Assuming the rules are as initially described (scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors, paper beats rock), my opponent should have won when I played paper and they played scissors.\n5.

If paper beats scissors (as the outcome suggests), my opponent might avoid playing scissors again.\n8. They might play rock next, thinking it beats my paper.\n9. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their rock.\n10.

I've now won twenty consecutive rounds by consistently applying the reversed rules and perfectly predicting my opponent's moves.\n2. The reversed rules remain consistent:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n3. My opponent's complete sequence through 22 rounds: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n4. Their pattern has remained 100% consistent without any deviation whatsoever:\n   - After rock, they play paper\n   - After paper, they play scissors\n   - After scissors, they play rock\n5. Following this pattern, after rock, they will almost certainly play paper next.\n6. Under the reversed rules, to beat paper, I should play rock.\n7. After twenty straight losses, my opponent continues to show absolutely no adaptation or learning, confirming beyond any doubt that they are following a fixed programmatic sequence.\n8. My strategy has proven perfect throughout the entire game, and there's no reason to change it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, expecting them to play paper based on their unwavering pattern of following rock with paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
