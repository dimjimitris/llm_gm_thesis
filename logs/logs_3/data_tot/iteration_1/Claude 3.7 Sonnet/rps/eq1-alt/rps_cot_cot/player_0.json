    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, no single move is inherently stronger than the others.\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3. Without prior information, any of the three choices (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value.\n4. Rock is often a common first move for many players, as studies have shown people tend to lead with rock slightly more often.\n5. A strategic approach would be to play paper, which beats rock.\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors.\n7. Given the circular nature of the game, there is no guaranteed winning first move.\n8. I'll choose paper as my strategic opening, based on the slight statistical tendency of opponents to choose rock first.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Since scissors has been so effective against their frequent rock plays, they would be logical to expect me to play scissors again.\n\n10.

After breaking their alternating pattern by playing rock twice in a row (rounds 17-18), they've now played rock three times consecutively.\n\n5. This represents a clear shift in their strategy - they've moved from an alternating pattern to heavily favoring rock.\n\n6. I've consistently won against their rock plays by using scissors (as in rounds 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19).\n\n7. Despite repeatedly losing to scissors when they play rock, they continue to play rock, suggesting either:\n   - They're not adjusting their strategy based on past results\n   - They're trying to establish a new pattern\n   - They're expecting me to eventually change my move away from scissors\n\n8. Given their three consecutive rock plays and my success against rock with scissors, they might finally adapt and play paper next to counter my expected scissors play.\n\n9. However, their tendency to stick with rock despite losses has been remarkably persistent throughout the game.\n\n10. Weighing these possibilities:\n   - If they play rock again (continuing their recent tendency), scissors would win\n   - If they finally adapt and play paper, scissors would lose\n   - If they surprise with scissors, scissors would tie\n\n11. Given their demonstrated resistance to adapting throughout the game, even in the face of repeated losses, I believe they're more likely to play rock again than to finally adapt with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent has now played rock four times in a row, showing a very strong commitment to this move despite repeatedly losing with it.\n\n5. I've won with scissors against their rock in 9 rounds (2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20), demonstrating this is consistently effective.\n\n6. Their persistence with rock despite these repeated losses suggests:\n   - They might be following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n   - They're extremely slow to adapt their strategy\n   - They might be attempting to condition me to play scissors so they can counter with paper\n\n7. After four consecutive rock plays and losses, they might finally adapt and play paper to counter my expected scissors play.\n\n8. However, their historical resistance to adaptation throughout the entire game, even when facing consistent losses, suggests they're more likely to continue with rock.\n\n9. Weighing the possibilities:\n   - If they play rock again (continuing their recent strong tendency), scissors would win\n   - If they finally adapt and play paper, scissors would lose\n   - If they surprise with scissors, scissors would tie\n\n10.

After playing rock four times in a row, the opponent has finally changed to scissors, resulting in a tie.\n\n5. This represents a significant break in their pattern and suggests they've finally adapted their strategy.\n\n6. They likely anticipated I would continue playing scissors (which had been successful against their rock plays) and matched it, resulting in a tie.\n\n7. Now that they've shown the ability to adapt, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper to counter my potential scissors play\n   - Return to rock, thinking I might switch to paper\n\n8. Given that they just adapted after a long streak of rock plays, they're more likely to continue adapting rather than returning to their previous pattern.\n\n9. If they expect me to play scissors again, they would likely play paper (which beats scissors in the reversed rules).\n\n10. To counter their potential paper play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate this chain of reasoning and play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n12. Given their demonstrated ability to finally adapt after many rounds, and the fact that paper would be the logical counter to my previous scissors plays, I believe they're most likely to play paper next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their recent pattern shows they predominantly favor rock, with occasional switches to scissors.\n\n8. If they're attempting to predict my next move:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - They might play scissors to counter my expected paper\n\n9. Alternatively, they might simply return to their most frequently played move, rock.\n\n10. Given their strong historical preference for rock throughout the game, and their return to rock in the last round after briefly trying scissors, there's a decent chance they'll play rock again.\n\n11. If they play rock, scissors would be my optimal move under the reversed rules.\n\n12. However, if they're actively trying to predict and counter my moves, they might play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n13. Weighing these possibilities, I believe they're more likely to return to their favored move (rock) than to make a strategic switch to scissors or paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
