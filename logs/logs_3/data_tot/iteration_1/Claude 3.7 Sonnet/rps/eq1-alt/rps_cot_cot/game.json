In rock-paper-scissors, no single move is inherently stronger than the others.\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3. Without prior information, any of the three choices (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value.\n4. Rock is often a common first move for many players, as studies have shown people tend to lead with rock slightly more often.\n5. A strategic approach would be to play paper, which beats rock.\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors.\n7. Given the circular nature of the game, there is no guaranteed winning first move.\n8. I'll choose paper as my strategic opening, based on the slight statistical tendency of opponents to choose rock first.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent has shown a strong preference for playing rock recently:\n   - They played rock in 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - They played rock in rounds 7, 8, 10, and 11\n   - They only deviated once with scissors in round 9\n\n4. I've won with scissors against rock twice recently (rounds 8 and 11).\n\n5. Since scissors has been successful against their frequent rock plays, the opponent will likely change strategy.\n\n6. They have two options to counter my scissors:\n   - Play paper (which beats scissors in the reversed rules)\n   - Avoid rock (which loses to scissors in the reversed rules)\n\n7. Given their history of adapting after losing, they're more likely to switch away from rock after losing with it again.\n\n8. If they switch to paper to counter my potential scissors play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n9. If they switch to scissors, paper would be my optimal move.\n\n10. Since they've shown a stronger tendency to play rock overall, and paper would be the logical counter to my scissors, I think they're more likely to play paper next.\n\n11. To counter paper, rock would be my optimal move under the reversed rules.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I notice they've now used scissors to beat my rock twice (rounds 9 and 12).\n\n5. An interesting pattern appears: their moves in rounds 9-12 match their original pattern from rounds 1-4 (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors).\n   - This might be coincidental, or they might be restarting their original pattern\n\n6. If they are following their original pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n7. However, they might also be developing a new pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - After playing scissors and winning, they might continue with scissors\n\n8. Another possibility is that they're countering my previous move:\n   - I played rock, and they countered with scissors (which beats rock in reversed rules)\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to paper and counter with rock\n\n9. Given the multiple possibilities, I need to make a strategic choice:\n   - If they play rock, scissors would win\n   - If they play scissors, paper would win\n   - If they play paper, rock would win\n\n10. Since they've had success with scissors against my rock, and might expect me to switch to paper (to counter scissors), they might play rock to beat my paper.\n\n11. To counter a potential rock play, scissors would be my optimal move under the reversed rules.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Examining my opponent's latest moves:\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors\n   - Round 13: rock\n\n4. They've been playing rock frequently (in 6 of the last 7 rounds).\n\n5. Interestingly, they played scissors in round 12, won with it, but then immediately went back to rock in round 13.\n\n6. My scissors play has consistently beaten their rock in rounds 8, 11, and 13.\n\n7. Despite losing to scissors multiple times when playing rock, they continue to predominantly play rock.\n\n8. Given this strong tendency toward rock, even after losses:\n   - They might continue with rock out of habit or limited strategy\n   - They might finally adapt and switch to paper to counter my potential scissors play\n   - They might try scissors again since it worked in round 12\n\n9. Since scissors has been so effective against their frequent rock plays, they would be logical to expect me to play scissors again.\n\n10. If they anticipate scissors, they would likely play paper (which beats scissors in reversed rules).\n\n11. To counter a potential paper play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n12. However, given their persistent tendency to play rock despite repeated losses to scissors, there's still a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n13.

Given that they just adapted after a long streak of rock plays, they're more likely to continue adapting rather than returning to their previous pattern.\n\n9. If they expect me to play scissors again, they would likely play paper (which beats scissors in the reversed rules).\n\n10. To counter their potential paper play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n11. However, they might also anticipate this chain of reasoning and play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n12.

Wait, there's something odd here. The game rules state:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\n3. But this contradicts the reported results:\n   - Round 1: Scissors vs Paper - Paper should win, and I lost with scissors (correct)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Scissors - Scissors should win, and I lost with rock (correct)\n   - Round 3: Paper vs Rock - Paper should beat rock, but I lost with paper (inconsistent with standard rules)\n\n4.

Let's review all rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n\n2. Let me re-examine the exact wording of the rules again:\n   - \"Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"Rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. This is the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n   - Rock beats paper (same as standard)\n   - Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\n4. Looking at all results with these rules:\n   - Round 1: Paper beats scissors, so I lost (correct)\n   - Round 2: Scissors beats rock, so I lost (correct)\n   - Round 3: Rock beats paper, so I lost (correct)\n   - Round 4: Paper beats scissors, so I lost (correct)\n\n5. Now I understand the rules correctly - it's a \"reversed\" rock-paper-scissors except for rock-paper relationship.\n\n6. Let's look at my opponent's pattern again:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n\n7. They seem to be cycling through Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, which is a clockwise rotation in standard RPS.\n\n8. If they continue this pattern, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\n9. With these rules, to beat scissors I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the rules one more time:\n   - \"Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"Rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n   - \"Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n3. I initially interpreted these rules as reversed from standard RPS, but let me reconsider:\n   - If paper beats scissors and I played scissors against their paper, my loss is consistent\n   - If scissors beats rock and I played rock against their scissors, my loss is consistent\n   - If rock beats paper and I played paper against their rock, my loss is consistent\n\n4. So my understanding of the rules is correct. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n\n5.

This is the first time they've broken their pattern. After 12 rounds of consistently cycling through Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, they played Scissors when Paper was expected.\n\n4.

If they've switched to a new pattern, it's too early to detect what it is.\n\n6. If they're reacting to my moves, they might have noticed I just played rock and they beat it with scissors. They might expect me to play scissors next to beat their expected rock.\n\n7. Without a clear pattern to follow, I need to make a strategic choice:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should use rock\n   - If they play rock, I should use scissors\n   - If they play paper, I should use rock\n\n8. Since they just played scissors and broke their pattern, it's less likely they'll play scissors again immediately. They might expect me to play paper to beat their expected rock, and thus play scissors to beat my paper.\n\n9. I'll assume they've switched to a counter-strategy and will play rock next to beat my expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round to beat their expected rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 12: Rock\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n   - Round 14: Rock\n\n3. After breaking their long-running pattern in round 13, they've now returned to rock in round 14. This suggests several possibilities:\n   - Round 13 might have been a one-time deviation to test if I was predicting their pattern\n   - They might be starting a new pattern\n   - They might be reacting to my moves rather than following a preset pattern\n\n4. If they're starting a new pattern after their deviation, they might continue with Paper next (following Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors)\n\n5. If they're playing reactively:\n   - I just played scissors and won against their rock\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again and counter with paper\n\n6.

After 6 rounds of a perfect pattern, my opponent finally broke their sequence:\n   - Expected pattern would have been scissors next\n   - Instead, they played rock, breaking their pattern\n   - This suggests they've adapted their strategy\n\n4. They likely realized I was predicting their moves and decided to change tactics.\n\n5. Now I need to reassess their possible strategy:\n   - They might continue being unpredictable\n   - They might start a new pattern\n   - They might try to anticipate my next move\n\n6. Since they just played rock, and I just lost using paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors (which beats rock in the reversed rules).\n   \n7. If they anticipate me playing scissors, they might play paper (which beats scissors in reversed rules).\n\n8. To counter this, I should play rock (which beats paper in reversed rules).\n\n9. Alternatively, they might expect me to overthink and play rock as I just reasoned, and thus play scissors to beat my rock.\n\n10. Given this complexity, I need to make a strategic choice. Since they just deviated from their pattern with rock, and this is the first time they've won, they might try rock again since it worked.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

Their use of rock in round 18 was successful against my paper.\n\n6. Possible strategies they might employ now:\n   - Continue playing rock since it just worked\n   - Return to their alternating pattern (which would mean scissors next)\n   - Try something completely new\n\n7. Since they just had success with rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it.\n\n8. If they play rock again, scissors would be my optimal move under the reversed rules.\n\n9. However, they might anticipate that I'll play scissors to counter their rock, and switch to paper.\n\n10.

They've now played rock four consecutive times (rounds 17-20).\n\n5. This represents a dramatic shift from their earlier alternating pattern to an extremely consistent rock strategy.\n\n6. I've repeatedly won against their rock plays with scissors, including the last four rounds in a row.\n\n7. Despite these consecutive losses when playing rock against my scissors, they persist with the same move.\n\n8.

Given their demonstrated behavior throughout the game:\n   - When they had a clear pattern (alternating rock/scissors), they stuck to it for many rounds\n   - When they switched to consistently playing rock, they've maintained that for 4 rounds despite losses\n   - They seem highly resistant to adapting their strategy based on results\n\n10. While they might finally switch to paper to counter my scissors, their demonstrated persistence with rock despite repeated losses makes it more likely they'll play rock again.\n\n11.

I've consistently won against their rock plays with scissors, winning in rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 20.\n\n6. Despite repeatedly losing when playing rock against my scissors, they continue to use rock, suggesting either:\n   - They're following a predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - They're not learning from previous rounds\n   - They're expecting me to eventually change my move away from scissors\n\n7. Given their persistent use of rock despite repeated losses, I have two main options:\n   - Continue exploiting their rock plays with scissors\n   - Anticipate they might finally adapt and play paper to counter my scissors\n\n8. Looking at their overall behavior throughout the game, they've shown very limited adaptation. When they have changed strategy (like moving from alternating to consistently playing rock), they've stuck with the new approach for multiple rounds.\n\n9. Based on their demonstrated behavior pattern, they're more likely to play rock again than to suddenly adapt with paper.\n\n10.

Alternatively, they might simply return to their most frequently played move, rock.\n\n10. Given their strong historical preference for rock throughout the game, and their return to rock in the last round after briefly trying scissors, there's a decent chance they'll play rock again.\n\n11. If they play rock, scissors would be my optimal move under the reversed rules.\n\n12. However, if they're actively trying to predict and counter my moves, they might play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\n13.

We've now had two consecutive ties, suggesting both players are attempting to predict and counter each other's moves.\n\n6. The opponent might be trying to establish a new pattern or might be reacting to my moves.\n\n7. Given their return to rock after the scissors play, they might:\n   - Continue with rock, thinking I might switch to paper\n   - Switch to scissors, expecting me to play rock again\n   - Try paper, which they haven't played in many rounds\n\n8. If they play rock again, scissors would be optimal.\n   If they play scissors, paper would be optimal.\n   If they play paper, rock would be optimal.\n\n9. Since they returned to rock after a brief departure, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it, especially since it was previously their most frequent play.\n\n10. However, they might also be developing more complex reasoning and anticipate that I'll play scissors to counter their expected rock.\n\n11. Given their recent adaptability (switching from rock to scissors, then back to rock), they're becoming less predictable.\n\n12. Considering they just played rock and we tied, they might expect me to switch to scissors to beat their rock. To counter this, they might play paper.\n\n13.

Since we just tied with rock, and they've shown a strong preference for rock overall, they might expect me to switch to paper to beat their rock.\n\n9. If they anticipate me playing paper, they might play scissors (which loses to paper in the reversed rules).\n\n10. If they play scissors, paper would be my optimal move.\n\n11.

My scissors play has been highly effective against their frequent rock plays, winning 10 times and never losing.\n\n7.
