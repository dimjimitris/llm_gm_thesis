Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any prior information about their tendencies.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors with standard payoffs, no single move has an advantage in a one-shot game against a rational opponent.\n3. However, there are some psychological tendencies in human players:\n   - Rock is often chosen slightly more frequently as a first move by many players\n   - Studies suggest inexperienced players tend to choose rock as their first move about 35-40% of the time\n4. Without any other information, I could choose paper to counter the most common first move (rock)\n5. However, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors\n6. Given the balanced nature of the game, any choice is theoretically equal in a single-round game against a rational player\n7. I'll choose scissors as my first move, as it's slightly less expected as a first move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now shown they're willing to play paper as a first move, going against the typical \"rock first\" tendency.\n3. There are a few possibilities to consider:\n   - My opponent might stick with paper since it worked (some players repeat winning moves)\n   - My opponent might anticipate that I'll choose rock to beat their paper, and switch to scissors\n   - My opponent might randomize their strategy to be unpredictable\n4. One common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is that players often shift their move in a clockwise direction after winning (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n5. If they follow this pattern, they would move from paper to scissors for this round\n6. To counter scissors, I should play rock\n7. If they instead repeat their winning move (paper), rock would lose against paper\n8. However, based on typical player psychology, winners more commonly shift than repeat\n9. Given this analysis, rock seems to be the best counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent didn't follow the clockwise winning pattern (paper \u2192 scissors) as I predicted, but they did change their move.\n5. Looking at the sequence: my opponent played paper, then scissors - they seem to be following the counter-clockwise rotation (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n6. If they continue this pattern, they will likely play rock next\n7. To beat rock, I should play paper\n8. Another possibility is that my opponent is simply playing the move that would have beaten my previous move:\n   - I played scissors in round 1, they played paper in round 1\n   - I played rock in round 2, they played scissors in round 2\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play rock to counter my previous scissors\n9.

Wait, there's something odd here. The game rules state:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\n3. But this contradicts the reported results:\n   - Round 1: Scissors vs Paper - Paper should win, and I lost with scissors (correct)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Scissors - Scissors should win, and I lost with rock (correct)\n   - Round 3: Paper vs Rock - Paper should beat rock, but I lost with paper (inconsistent with standard rules)\n\n4. There are two possibilities:\n   - Either the rule description was incorrect/reversed\n   - Or there was a reporting error in the last round\n\n5.

It seems the game has non-standard rules. Paper loses to scissors, and scissors loses to rock.\n\n7.

My opponent's pattern up until now:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Paper\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Rock\n   - Round 10: Paper\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Rock\n   - Round 13: Scissors (expected Paper based on previous pattern)\n\n3. This is the first time they've broken their pattern. After 12 rounds of consistently cycling through Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, they played Scissors when Paper was expected.\n\n4. This could mean:\n   - They realized I had detected their pattern and changed strategy\n   - They are now using a different pattern\n   - They might be reacting to my moves rather than following a preset pattern\n\n5. If they've switched to a new pattern, it's too early to detect what it is.\n\n6. If they're reacting to my moves, they might have noticed I just played rock and they beat it with scissors. They might expect me to play scissors next to beat their expected rock.\n\n7. Without a clear pattern to follow, I need to make a strategic choice:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should use rock\n   - If they play rock, I should use scissors\n   - If they play paper, I should use rock\n\n8. Since they just played scissors and broke their pattern, it's less likely they'll play scissors again immediately. They might expect me to play paper to beat their expected rock, and thus play scissors to beat my paper.\n\n9. I'll assume they've switched to a counter-strategy and will play rock next to beat my expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round to beat their expected rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let me update my record of recent rounds:\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 15: Scissors\n   - Round 16: Paper\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n\n3. They've now played Scissors three times in a row, breaking their previous alternating pattern.\n\n4. This suggests they've noticed I keep playing Rock and are exploiting it by repeatedly playing Scissors.\n\n5. I need to break my own pattern of frequently playing Rock and adapt.\n\n6. Since they've played Scissors three times in a row:\n   - They might continue with Scissors if they think I'll play Rock again\n   - They might switch to Rock expecting me to finally play Paper to counter their Scissors\n   - They might switch to Paper to surprise me\n\n7. The most likely scenario is that they'll either:\n   - Continue with Scissors expecting me to stubbornly play Rock again\n   - Or switch to Rock expecting me to finally counter with Paper\n\n8. Given that they've played Scissors so frequently, I think they're less likely to play it a fourth time in a row.\n\n9. I believe they'll switch to Rock next, expecting me to play Paper.\n\n10. To counter Rock according to these rules, I should play Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played Scissors four times in a row, which is a very strong pattern.\n\n4. The tie in the last round suggests they're committed to playing Scissors frequently.\n\n5. After a tie, players often:\n   - Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n   - Change their move, expecting the opponent to stay the same\n   - Change to what would beat their previous move\n\n6. Given that they've played Scissors so consistently:\n   - They might continue with Scissors if they think I'll switch back to Rock\n   - They might switch to Paper expecting me to play Scissors again\n   - They might switch to Rock to break their own pattern\n\n7. Since they've been so consistent with Scissors, I think they're more likely to continue with this strategy.\n\n8. If they play Scissors again, I should play Rock to beat it.\n\n9. If they switch to Paper (expecting me to play Scissors), my Rock would still win.\n\n10. The only scenario where Rock loses is if they switch to Rock, which seems less likely given their strong pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After playing Scissors four times in a row, they've now switched to Rock.\n\n4. This represents a significant change in their pattern, possibly indicating:\n   - They're trying to be less predictable\n   - They anticipated I would play Rock to counter their Scissors streak\n   - They're starting a new pattern\n\n5. After two consecutive ties, both players often try to gain advantage by playing what would beat the previous move.\n\n6. Given that we both just played Rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Continue with Rock (expecting them to switch to Scissors)\n   - Switch to Paper to beat their Rock\n   - Switch to Scissors to surprise them\n\n7. The most logical move for them would be to play Paper to beat my expected Rock, or scissors to beat my expected Paper.\n\n8. If they play Paper, I should play Rock to beat it.\n9. If they play Scissors, I should also play Rock to beat it.\n10. If they play Rock again, it would be another tie.\n\n11. Given their previous long streak of Scissors followed by a switch to Rock, I think they're more likely to play Paper next to establish a new pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After a brief deviation to Rock in round 22, they've returned to playing Scissors.\n\n4. Their pattern over the last 6 rounds has been heavily focused on Scissors (4 times), with Paper and Rock appearing once each.\n\n5. This suggests they might have a preference for playing Scissors.\n\n6. Looking at my own moves, I've played Rock 5 out of the last 6 rounds, which might be why they keep playing Scissors.\n\n7. I need to break my pattern of predominantly playing Rock.\n\n8.
