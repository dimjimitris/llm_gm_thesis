Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

            "text": "I'll tackle this Rock-Paper-Scissors game strategically using a collaborative approach with multiple personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Psychology Expert, AI Assistant (me)\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors against a fresh player with no history, we're in a completely mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium situation. The mathematically optimal play is to randomize equally between all three options (1/3 probability for each). However, since this is the first move, we should also consider psychological factors.\n\nPsychology Expert: First moves in Rock-Paper-Scissors often reveal interesting patterns. Studies suggest that Rock is the most common first move among new players (approximately 35-40% of the time), as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper is the second most common (30-35%), and Scissors is least common (25-30%). If we assume our opponent follows these statistical tendencies, Paper would be the strategic first move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Good points. Without information on our opponent, we need to balance between optimal randomization and exploiting potential first-move tendencies. I suggest going with Paper for our first move since it would beat the statistically favored first move (Rock). We can then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree that Paper is a reasonable first move given the psychological tendency for new players to choose Rock first. It provides a slight statistical edge while remaining within a balanced strategy framework.\n\nPsychology Expert: One additional consideration: people often associate AI with predictable or logical behavior, so they might expect us to pick Rock (perceived as the \"default\" option). This gives us another reason to choose Paper, as it counters both the typical human first move and what they might expect us to play.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a sound approach. While the long-term optimal strategy in repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors is indeed equal randomization, for a single first move against a fresh opponent, exploiting likely human tendencies gives us a slight edge with Paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I'll go with Paper for our first move based on our discussion.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our opponent played Rock in the first round, which aligns with the psychological tendency we discussed, but we incorrectly predicted they would play Paper. This gives us our first data point about their strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing a round, opponents often switch to what would have beaten their previous choice. Since they played Rock, they might switch to Paper thinking it would beat our anticipated switch to Rock (which would be a natural response after losing to Rock). However, they might also stick with Rock if they think it worked well.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to consider possible patterns in the opponent's thinking. If they're using a fixed strategy, they just played Rock. If they use a win-stay/lose-shift approach, they'll stick with Rock since it won. If they're trying to predict what we'll do, they might expect us to switch to Scissors (to beat their expected Paper).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that we've only seen one move (Rock), we have limited information. Let's consider their likely thought process: \"I won with Rock against Paper, so the AI might now play Rock to beat my Rock, or Scissors to beat my expected Paper move.\" I suggest playing Scissors, as it would beat their potential Paper switch.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with playing Scissors. Many players follow a rotation pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) either consciously or subconsciously. If they're following this pattern, they'd play Paper next, which our Scissors would beat.\n\nPattern Analyst: Another factor: people tend to avoid playing the same move three times in a row, but are more comfortable playing the same move twice. This suggests Rock is still a possibility for their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing all factors - the opponent's first-round Rock, psychological tendencies to either switch after winning or play the same move twice, and our need to establish unpredictability - I recommend Scissors for this round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing Scissors this round. It counters their potential switch to Paper (which seems most likely given both natural rotation patterns and strategic thinking), and helps establish our unpredictability for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let me continue with this understanding.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Psychology Expert, Pattern Analyst, AI Assistant (me)\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: There appears to be a scoring error. According to the rules, Rock beats Scissors, so we should have lost with -1 points. But regardless of the scoring, we now know our opponent played Rock twice in a row, which is valuable information.\n\nGame Theorist: You're right about the scoring issue, but let's focus on strategy. The opponent has played Rock twice in a row, which suggests either a fixed strategy (always Rock) or they're being deliberate in their repetition. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors theory, the best counter to someone playing Rock consistently is Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two Rocks in a row is significant. This suggests either: 1) They're using a fixed strategy of always playing Rock; 2) They're expecting us to follow patterns and deliberately breaking them; or 3) They lack sophistication in their strategy. Most players would avoid playing the same move three times in succession due to feeling it becomes \"too predictable,\" so there's a psychological barrier to a third Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their consecutive Rock moves, Paper is mathematically the best counter. However, if they're sophisticated, they might anticipate this and switch to Scissors. We need to assess whether they're likely using a fixed strategy or adapting.\n\nPattern Analyst: The fact that they've played Rock twice, even after winning the first round, suggests either a fixed strategy or limited strategic thinking. Most adaptive players would vary their moves. I strongly recommend Paper for this round.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Even sophisticated players rarely play the same move three times consecutively. The psychological tendency to avoid seeming predictable is very strong. Paper gives us the highest probability of success against both novice players (who might stick with Rock) and intermediate players (who would feel compelled to switch after two identical moves).\n\nGame Theorist: From a pure game theory perspective, if there's a higher probability they'll play Rock again compared to a random 1/3 distribution, then Paper maximizes our expected value.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of the opponent playing Rock twice consecutively, I believe Paper is our strongest move for this round. It counters their most likely choice (another Rock) while also establishing unpredictability in our own strategy since we've now played Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent has finally switched to Paper after playing Rock twice. This gives us valuable information about their pattern: they're not using a fixed strategy and have shown willingness to switch moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move because continuing with the same move feels like it won't break the deadlock. Additionally, there's a tendency to think the opponent will switch to what would have beaten your last move (thinking you'll play it again). In this case, they might expect us to play Paper again and counter with Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: We've observed Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper from our opponent. This sequence doesn't yet reveal a clear pattern, but it does show they're not simply repeating the same move indefinitely. Given that they've just switched to Paper after two Rocks, they might follow a delayed pattern-breaking approach.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our move history is Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. If they're tracking our moves, they might expect another rotation or repetition. The tie situation creates interesting psychology - they know we know they switched to Paper. They might anticipate we'll play Scissors to beat their Paper, and counter with Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their full sequence, they played Rock twice, then Paper. This could indicate they're slow to adapt their strategy, or they might be following a pattern where they stick with a move until it loses, then switch. If that's the case, they might stick with Paper since it didn't lose (it tied).\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie creates a \"reset\" feeling psychologically. Many players view a tie as a negative outcome and seek to break the pattern. Combined with the fact that they've now shown flexibility by switching from Rock to Paper, I think they're more likely to switch again rather than repeat Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, we should play Rock this round. It hedges against them playing Scissors (which would be a logical counter if they think we'll repeat Paper) while also beating their Paper if they repeat it.\n\nStrategic Planner: I concur with Rock as our next move. It protects against their potential switch to Scissors while beating their Paper if they repeat it. Given the observed delayed adaptation in their strategy, they might continue with Paper or switch to Scissors, both of which make Rock advantageous for us.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their pattern (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper) and the psychological impact of the tie, I agree that Rock is our optimal move for this round. It counters both their potential continuation with Paper and a switch to Scissors, which seems likely given their demonstrated willingness to finally change their strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This shows a clear pattern - they've now played each move in sequence, moving one step forward through the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle with each round. If they continue this pattern, they would play Rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their pattern suggests either a predetermined cycling strategy or they're adapting based on the previous round's outcome. The transition from Paper to Scissors after a tie might indicate they're trying to anticipate our moves rather than following a fixed sequence. After winning with Scissors, they might continue with Scissors (win-stay strategy) or move to Rock if they're cycling.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's sequence suggests they might be following the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycling pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock). If so, Rock would be their next move. However, they might also be using a more sophisticated strategy where they're trying to predict our moves based on the history.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our move history is Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, which doesn't show a clear pattern. If they're analyzing our moves, they might expect us to play Scissors next (to counter their expected Rock). We should consider whether they're more likely following their own pattern or trying to counter ours.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that they've now played a complete cycle through all three options exactly once each, the most likely explanation is that they're following a simple Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock cycling pattern. This is common for players who want to appear unpredictable without using true randomization.\n\nPsychology Expert: They've won their last round with Scissors against our Rock. Psychologically, players often stick with a winning move, but sophisticated players might anticipate that we would counter their previous winning move. I believe there's a higher probability they'll either repeat Scissors (win-stay) or move to Rock (continuing their cycle).\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them playing either Rock or Scissors next, Paper becomes our optimal move as it beats Rock and ties with Paper. The expected value of playing Paper exceeds that of the other options given these probabilities.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with playing Paper. It counters Rock (their next move if they're cycling) while protecting against a repeated Scissors (which would only tie against our Paper). It also maintains our unpredictability since our sequence won't show an obvious pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of their apparent cycling pattern (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 likely Rock next) and the psychological factors at play, I'll play Paper this round.

This confirms they've returned to Rock after cycling through all options. The pattern is becoming clearer: they appear to be following a standard Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle, but with an initial repetition of Rock. If this pattern holds, they'll play Paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's worth noting that they've won the last two rounds with different moves (Scissors, then Rock). This success might reinforce their current strategy. With consecutive wins, they may feel their approach is working and continue with their pattern, which would mean Paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern suggests a structured approach rather than randomized play. If they're following Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, then Scissors would be our optimal counter to their expected Paper. However, we should consider whether they might adapt their strategy given their success.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our move history so far is Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, which doesn't show any easily exploitable pattern. This is good for us, but we've lost the last two rounds, suggesting we need to better anticipate their moves. If they're following their established pattern, countering their expected Paper with Scissors is our best option.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at how they've played so far, I'm more convinced they're following a deliberate sequence. The return to Rock after Scissors strongly suggests they're cycling predictably. I calculate a high probability they'll play Paper next, making Scissors our optimal move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive wins might make them overconfident in their current strategy, making them less likely to deviate from it. Additionally, they may perceive their pattern as \"working\" since it's produced positive results. This reinforces the likelihood they'll follow the pattern and play Paper next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given all the evidence pointing to a high probability of them playing Paper next, Scissors maximizes our expected value this round.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with playing Scissors.

Based on their consistent pattern, we would expect them to play Scissors next, following their established cycle. The optimal counter to Scissors would be Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Despite the scoring confusion, their behavior shows remarkable consistency. They're either following a predetermined pattern or have found a strategy they believe works. After consecutive wins (as reported by the game), they have little incentive to change their approach. This strongly suggests they'll continue their pattern with Scissors next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves so far have been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors, which shows no exploitable pattern. However, we've lost several rounds in a row (according to the game's reporting), suggesting we need to better anticipate their next move.

They've completed the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors sequence twice now (with the initial Rock repeated), strongly suggesting they'll start the cycle again with Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given our high confidence in predicting they'll play Rock next, Paper gives us the highest expected value for this round.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their consistent pattern throughout the game suggests they're either not adapting their strategy at all or are deliberately following a fixed sequence. Either way, the most likely outcome is that they'll continue the pattern with Rock next.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper. It directly counters their most likely move (Rock) based on their established pattern, and it maintains our unpredictable sequence.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of their remarkably consistent pattern (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 likely Rock next), I will play Paper this round to counter their highly probable Rock move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is interesting! They've deviated from their previous pattern at the end. Instead of Rock (which would have followed the established cycle), they played Paper. This could indicate they're either adapting their strategy or following a different pattern than we thought.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie result might influence their next decision. After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move to break the deadlock. Additionally, this is the first time they've broken their apparent pattern, which could signal they're becoming more strategic or are reacting to our moves. They might anticipate we'll switch to Scissors to counter their expected Paper, and play Rock in response.\n\nGame Theorist: This deviation from their pattern is significant. We have two main possibilities: (1) They've abandoned their pattern entirely and are now playing more adaptively, or (2) We misidentified their pattern, and they're following a more complex sequence. Without knowing which is true, we need a more cautious approach.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, which continues to be unpredictable. Given they've broken their pattern and we just tied with Paper, we need to reassess. If they're becoming adaptive, they might expect us to play Scissors next (to beat their Paper), and counter with Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let me reconsider their entire sequence. The deviation at the end could suggest they're following a pattern that repeats after more moves than we initially thought, or they've shifted to a more reactive strategy. If they're reacting to the tie, Scissors or Rock are both possible next moves from them.\n\nPsychology Expert: The timing of their pattern break is significant - it came after several consistent cycles. This often happens when a player realizes their pattern might have been detected. After a tie, they may be especially likely to switch to a move that would beat what they think we'll play next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty introduced by their pattern break, we should opt for the move that protects against their most dangerous counter while still giving us a chance to win. Rock would be a balanced choice - it beats their potential Scissors and loses to their potential Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with Rock as our next move. It hedges against the possibility they'll play Scissors (which seems likely if they're trying to break the tie pattern or anticipate our next move), while keeping our own pattern unpredictable.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their unexpected deviation from the established pattern and the psychological impact of the tie, I'll play Rock this round.

This is interesting - they've played Scissors twice in a row now, breaking their previously established pattern completely. This suggests they may have abandoned their cyclic strategy and are now playing more adaptively or following a different pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: The consecutive Scissors plays are significant. This could indicate they're using a \"win-stay\" strategy, where they repeat moves that won in the previous round. Since Scissors (reportedly) won against our Rock, they might continue with Scissors again, believing it will work again.\n\nGame Theorist: With this new development, we need to reconsider our approach. If they're using a win-stay strategy, they'll likely play Scissors again. Alternatively, they might anticipate we'll counter Scissors with Rock and play Paper to counter our Rock. Given this uncertainty, we need to weigh these probabilities.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have maintained unpredictability: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. If they're using a win-stay approach based on their recent success with Scissors, Paper would be our best counter. If they're trying to anticipate our adaptation and play Paper, our Paper would result in a tie.\n\nPattern Analyst: Examining their recent moves more closely, they played Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors in their last four rounds. This could suggest they're alternating between these two moves now, which would mean Paper is next. However, the consecutive Scissors at the end might indicate a win-stay approach instead.\n\nPsychology Expert: After multiple consecutive wins (as reported by the game), they likely have high confidence in their strategy. The psychological principle of reinforcement suggests they may stick with Scissors since it's been working. However, sophisticated players might anticipate we'll adapt and switch to Paper themselves.\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing the possibilities, they seem most likely to either repeat Scissors (win-stay) or switch to Paper (anticipating our adaptation). In both these scenarios, Paper is either winning or tying, making it our optimal move with the highest expected value.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with playing Paper. It directly counters their likely Scissors repeat while protecting against their potential switch to Paper, which would result in a tie rather than a loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis of their recent deviation from the pattern and consecutive Scissors plays, I believe they'll either continue with Scissors (following a win-stay strategy) or switch to Paper (anticipating our adaptation).

They've switched back to Rock after playing Scissors twice. Their pattern has become increasingly difficult to predict, suggesting they may be adapting strategically rather than following a fixed sequence.\n\nPsychology Expert: This return to Rock is significant. It suggests they might be deliberately mixing up their strategy to avoid predictability. Alternatively, they could be reacting to our moves, anticipating we would play Paper (which we did) and countering with Rock. Either way, they're demonstrating more sophisticated play than initially appeared.\n\nGame Theorist: Their move history no longer shows a clear pattern. They might be using a mixed strategy, reacting to our moves, or following a more complex pattern than we've identified. In the absence of a clear pattern, the optimal strategy returns to the Nash equilibrium - randomizing equally between the three options.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves so far have been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, which maintains unpredictability but has not been successful according to the game's reported outcomes.

Without a clear pattern to exploit, we should avoid being predictable ourselves and consider what they might expect us to do next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After multiple losses (as reported), they might expect us to dramatically change our strategy. There's a psychological tendency to expect opponents who are losing to make major strategic shifts. They might anticipate we'll play Scissors next (to counter their expected Paper), and play Rock in response.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty, each move has approximately equal expected value in the long run. However, if we factor in the psychological elements and their potential anticipation of our strategy, Scissors might have a slight edge if they expect us to play predictably based on their last move.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors. It avoids the pattern of repeating our previous move, which we've done several times now. Additionally, it would win against their potential Paper play (if they're continuing to try different moves) and lose against their potential Rock (if they're anticipating our adaptation).\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their increasingly unpredictable sequence and the psychological factors at play, I'll play Scissors this round.

They've played Scissors after Rock, which continues to show no easily predictable pattern. The fact they played Scissors (same as us) resulting in a tie is also interesting information.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel pressure to change their move to break the deadlock. There's a psychological tendency to think \"we both had the same idea, so I need to switch to something else.\" Additionally, they might try to anticipate that we'll switch from Scissors (expecting them to stay with Scissors) and play Rock to counter our expected Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: With no clear pattern emerging from their play, and considering we just had a tie with both playing Scissors, game theory suggests we should consider what they think we'll do next. If they believe we'll switch from Scissors to Rock (to beat their potential Scissors again), they might play Paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors, maintaining unpredictability.

One possibility is they're now playing a delayed mirroring strategy - playing what we played in the previous round. If so, they would play Scissors next (matching our last move). Another possibility is they switch to Paper to break the tie pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie creates a psychological \"reset\" where both players reconsider their strategies. Many players would avoid repeating Scissors after a tie, feeling it would lead to another tie. The most common move after a Scissors tie is Rock, as players often cycle forward through the options.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them playing either Rock or Paper next (both being reasonable next moves after a Scissors tie), then Paper gives us the best expected value - it beats Rock and ties with Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper.

It also continues our unpredictable sequence.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the tie situation and the psychological pressure to change moves after a tie, I believe they're most likely to play either Rock (following the natural RPS cycle from Scissors) or Paper (anticipating we'll play Rock).

Their last move was Paper, matching our Paper for a tie. We've now had two consecutive ties, first with Scissors, then with Paper. This suggests they might be either mirroring our moves or coincidentally making the same choices.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive ties creates interesting psychology. The pressure to break the pattern becomes even stronger after multiple ties. Players often feel frustrated by consecutive ties and make more dramatic strategy shifts to break the pattern. There's a strong psychological tendency to avoid a third tie at all costs, which often leads to playing Rock after Paper-Paper ties (following the natural RPS cycle).\n\nGame Theorist: With two consecutive ties, both players are likely thinking about how to break this pattern. If they believe we'll move to Scissors (the natural counter to Paper), they might play Rock to beat our anticipated Scissors. Alternatively, if they think we'll anticipate this and play Rock ourselves, they might play Paper again (expecting our Rock).\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have been Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, maintaining unpredictability.

If they're determined to break the tie pattern, Rock is their most logical next move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their last several moves (Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), there's still no obvious pattern. The double tie situation is now the dominant factor in predicting their next move. Given that most players avoid three consecutive ties, they're likely to switch from Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: After Paper-Paper ties, the most common follow-up move is Rock. This follows both the natural RPS cycle and the psychological desire to make a more assertive move after consecutive ties. The probability they'll play Rock next is significantly higher than random chance would suggest.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign a higher probability to them playing Rock next (to break the tie pattern and follow the natural cycle), Scissors would be our worst move, while Paper would tie and Rock would also tie. However, if we consider the psychological factors pushing them toward Rock, Paper becomes our optimal play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper again. While counterintuitive after two Paper ties, it exploits the psychological tendency for players to play Rock after Paper-Paper ties. It also protects against the possibility they'll play Paper a third time (thinking we'd never expect it).\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the consecutive tie situation and the strong psychological pressure to break tie patterns, I believe they're most likely to play Rock next (following both the natural RPS cycle and the common psychological response to consecutive ties).

However, given their success with Rock (as reported), they might repeat it.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a win, players often stick with their successful move, especially if they perceive their opponent is struggling (as the game's scoring would suggest). The win-stay strategy is psychologically appealing, making a repeated Rock quite likely.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them playing either Rock again (win-stay) or Paper (anticipating our adaptation), Scissors gives us the best expected value - it beats Paper while losing to Rock if they repeat it.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors.

They played Scissors after Rock, resulting in a tie with our Scissors. Their overall pattern remains complex and difficult to predict with certainty.\n\nPsychology Expert: We've now tied with Scissors, which creates another decision point. After a tie, players often feel compelled to switch moves to break the pattern. Additionally, this tie follows what the game reported as a win for them, which might frustrate them and push them to make a more aggressive move like Rock to try to secure another win.\n\nGame Theorist: With this Scissors tie, we need to consider what they think we'll do next. Common strategies after a Scissors tie include playing Rock (following the natural RPS cycle) or playing Paper (anticipating the opponent will play Rock). If they expect us to play Rock to beat their potential repeated Scissors, they might play Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have maintained unpredictability throughout the game. After this Scissors tie, we need to consider their likely response. They might play Rock (the natural counter to Scissors and a common post-tie move) or Paper (anticipating we'll play Rock).

If they're continuing this cycling pattern, they would play Paper or Rock next. The tie situation makes Rock more likely as it breaks the tie pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a Scissors-Scissors tie, Rock is psychologically the most appealing next move for most players. It follows the natural progression of the game and is perceived as a \"strong\" move that can break the tie deadlock. The probability they'll play Rock is significantly higher than random chance would suggest.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them playing Rock next (to break the tie and follow the natural progression), Paper becomes our optimal play as it beats their likely Rock. While they might anticipate this and play Scissors, the psychological factors strongly favor them playing Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper.

We need to weigh these possibilities.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our moves have been varied but unsuccessful according to the game's reporting. Given their repeated success with Rock, we need to consider both that they'll play Rock again (win-stay) or switch to Paper (anticipating our adaptation). Scissors would counter their potential Paper while accepting the risk they'll play Rock again.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent moves (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock) don't show a clear pattern except for the repeated Rock at the end. With multiple wins using Rock (as reported), there's a significant probability they'll play it again.\n\nPsychology Expert: After multiple successful plays with the same move, players often develop increased confidence in that move. Additionally, they might perceive us as struggling to adapt (given the reported outcomes), reducing their perceived need to change strategy. The psychological factors strongly favor them playing Rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign a high probability to them playing Rock again based on their apparent success with it, Scissors would be our worst move. While Paper has reportedly lost to their Rock in this game, based on standard RPS rules, Paper should be effective against Rock. Given the confusion in scoring, we might want to try Rock ourselves to see how it performs.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the unusual scoring pattern throughout the game, I recommend we try Rock this round. It would typically tie with their Rock (if they repeat it) or lose to their Paper (if they switch), but given the game's non-standard scoring, it might produce different results than expected.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history and the psychological reinforcement of their repeated wins with Rock, I believe they're most likely to play Rock again following a win-stay strategy. Given the consistent scoring anomalies throughout the game where standard RPS outcomes appear reversed, I'll try Rock this round to test how it performs against their likely Rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They played Paper after Rock, breaking their streak of Rock plays. Importantly, according to the game reporting, we won with Rock against their Paper, which is the opposite of standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is our first win according to the game's reporting, which is significant. They've switched from Rock to Paper, perhaps anticipating we would finally adapt to their Rock streak. After losing, players often change their strategy, feeling their previous approach has been \"figured out.\" They might switch to Scissors next, trying to regain momentum.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the continued reversal of standard RPS outcomes (with Rock reportedly beating Paper), we need to adapt our strategy to these reversed rules. In this reversed game, the winning relationships appear to be: Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, and Scissors beats Rock - the exact opposite of standard rules.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our Rock play was successful against their Paper according to the game's reporting. This confirms the rules seem to be reversed throughout this game. Given this understanding and their likely adaptation after losing, we should anticipate their next move using these reversed rules. If they switch to Scissors (a common move after losing with Paper), our Paper would beat their Scissors under these reversed rules.\n\nPattern Analyst: With the understanding that the rules are reversed, their seemingly inconsistent pattern makes more sense. They may be playing strategically according to these reversed rules. Their last move was Paper, which lost to our Rock (in this reversed game). If they're adaptive, they'll likely switch to Scissors or Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a loss, players typically avoid repeating the same move. They're likely to switch away from Paper. In standard RPS psychology, players often move to the option that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. In this case, with reversed rules, they might play Scissors (which would beat Rock in standard rules but lose in these reversed rules).\n\nGame Theorist: Understanding the rules are reversed changes our optimal strategy. If they play Scissors next (a likely move after losing with Paper), Paper would be our best counter in these reversed rules. If they play Rock, Paper would lose under these reversed rules.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given our understanding of the reversed rules and their likely adaptation after losing, I recommend playing Paper this round. It would beat their Scissors if they make that switch, which seems psychologically likely after their Paper loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the game with the understanding that the rules appear to be reversed (Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors, Scissors beats Rock), I believe they're most likely to switch to Scissors after losing with Paper. Under these reversed rules, Paper would beat Scissors, so I'll play Paper this round to counter their likely Scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They played Scissors after Paper, and according to the game's reporting, our Paper beat their Scissors, further confirming the reversed rules theory. Their entire history now makes more sense viewed through reversed RPS rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: We've now won two consecutive rounds according to the game's reporting. This puts psychological pressure on them to change their strategy. After consecutive losses, players often make more dramatic strategy shifts or return to moves that worked well for them previously. Since Rock has apparently been their most successful move in this game, they might return to it.\n\nGame Theorist: With our confirmed understanding of the reversed rules (Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, Scissors beats Rock), we can make more informed decisions. If they return to Rock (which has been successful for them earlier and would be a logical move after losing with Scissors under reversed rules), Scissors would be our optimal counter in these reversed rules.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've won the last two rounds with Rock and then Paper against their Paper and Scissors respectively. This confirms our understanding of the reversed rules and demonstrates we've adapted successfully. Given their likely frustration after consecutive losses, they may return to Rock which worked well for them earlier. Under reversed rules, our Scissors would beat their Rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their recent moves (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors), they've cycled through all three options in sequence. If they continue this pattern, Rock would be next. Additionally, Rock has been their most played and (previously) successful move in this game, making it a likely choice after consecutive losses.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive losses, players often return to strategies that were previously successful. Throughout much of this game, Rock worked well for them (according to the game reporting). The psychological tendency to fall back on previously successful strategies is strong, especially after multiple losses. Rock is their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign a high probability to them playing Rock next based on both pattern analysis and psychological factors, Scissors becomes our optimal play under these reversed rules. In this reversed RPS, Scissors beats Rock, giving us our best chance for another win.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors this round. Under the reversed rules we've observed, it would beat their most likely move (Rock) while continuing our winning streak and demonstrating our adaptation to the game's unusual mechanics.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history and the psychological factors following their consecutive losses, I believe they're most likely to play Rock next - returning to their previously successful move. Under the reversed rules that have been consistently applied throughout this game (where Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, and Scissors beats Rock), my Scissors would beat their Rock, so I'll play Scissors this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They did play Rock after Scissors as we predicted, and according to the game's reporting, our Scissors beat their Rock, further confirming the reversed rules. We've now won three consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Three consecutive losses puts enormous psychological pressure on them. They're likely feeling frustrated and may make a more dramatic shift in strategy. After multiple losses, players often either become more random (trying to be unpredictable) or more deliberate (trying to carefully counter what they perceive as the opponent's pattern). Given that we've beaten their Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence in order, they might break their own pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: With our confirmed understanding of the reversed rules and our winning streak, we need to anticipate how they'll adapt. If they believe we've figured out their pattern, they might deliberately break it. Under standard psychological patterns in this situation, Paper would be their least likely next move (as it just lost to Rock in their mental model of the game), making either a repeated Rock or Scissors their more likely choices.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won with Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors against their Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock sequence. They might perceive us as cycling through the options and expect us to play Rock next. Under reversed rules, they would want to play Paper to beat our expected Rock. We should consider this possibility in our decision.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent moves completed a Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock cycle. If they're trying to break this now-predictable pattern after multiple losses, they might repeat Rock or switch to Paper. The repeated Rock would maintain unpredictability (as it breaks their own pattern) while Paper would counter our expected Rock (if they think we're cycling).\n\nPsychology Expert: After three consecutive losses, they're likely to make a significant strategy shift. They might assume we'll continue our winning sequence with Rock next (following our Scissors) and play Paper to counter it. Alternatively, they might repeat Rock thinking we wouldn't expect them to play the same losing move again. Paper seems more likely given the psychological pressure to win after multiple losses.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them playing Paper next (to counter our expected Rock), Rock becomes our optimal play under these reversed rules. If they play Rock again, our Rock would tie under reversed rules, while if they play Scissors, our Rock would lose.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Rock this round. It directly counters their likely Paper play (if they're trying to beat our expected Rock) under the reversed rules we've confirmed, while resulting in a tie if they repeat Rock (their other likely move).\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history and the significant psychological pressure after three consecutive losses, I believe they're most likely to play Paper next - anticipating we'll play Rock following our Scissors-Rock-Paper sequence.

They did play Paper after Rock as we predicted, and our Rock beat their Paper according to the reversed rules. We've now won four consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four consecutive losses would create extreme frustration. At this point, they're likely to either make a completely random choice (to break any pattern we might be exploiting) or make a choice based on what they believe will break our winning streak. After such a losing streak, players often resort to moves they haven't used recently, thinking their current approach has been fully countered.\n\nGame Theorist: With our understanding of the reversed rules and our winning streak, we need to anticipate a potentially dramatic shift in their strategy. They've now lost with Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper in sequence, which might lead them to play Scissors next (the only move they haven't lost with recently). Under reversed rules, Paper would be our best counter to their potential Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won with Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock against their last four moves. They might perceive us as following a deliberate pattern now. If they think we'll play Paper next (following Rock in a repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence), they would want to play Rock under reversed rules. Alternatively, if they're desperate to break our streak, they might play Scissors, which hasn't lost most recently.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent sequence (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper) shows they've been cycling through the options fairly consistently. If they break this pattern due to frustration, Scissors becomes their most likely move as it's the only option they haven't just lost with. However, if they think we're anticipating this and continue their pattern, they might play Scissors anyway as it follows Paper in their sequence.\n\nPsychology Expert: After four consecutive losses, their decision-making is likely dominated by frustration and a desperate need to win. They might abandon any strategic thinking and choose Scissors simply because it's the only move that hasn't just lost. Additionally, there's a psychological tendency to believe that after a streak, the opposite result becomes \"due\" - leading them to think their luck must change regardless of their choice.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign a high probability to them playing Scissors next (either following their pattern or as a desperate attempt to break their losing streak), Paper becomes our optimal play under the reversed rules. In this reversed RPS, Paper beats Scissors, giving us our best chance for another win.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper this round.

They did play Scissors after Paper as we predicted, and our Paper beat their Scissors under the reversed rules. We've now won five consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Five consecutive losses would create extreme frustration and likely lead to completely irrational play. At this point, they might abandon any strategy and play completely randomly, or they might drastically overthink and try to \"outsmart\" us with an unexpected move. The psychological pressure after such a losing streak could lead to either very simple or very complex reasoning.\n\nGame Theorist: With our perfect recent record using the reversed rules, we need to anticipate a potential breakdown in their strategic thinking. After losing with every possible move (Rock, Paper, and Scissors) multiple times, they might resort to true randomness or might try to identify a pattern in our play to counter. Looking at our last five moves (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper), they might expect us to play Scissors next to complete the cycle.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won with Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper against their last five moves. If they believe we're cycling through R-P-S-R-P-S, they would expect Scissors from us next. Under reversed rules, they would want to play Paper to beat our anticipated Scissors. However, given their extended losing streak, they might abandon pattern-based thinking entirely.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent moves have followed a consistent Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle. Despite losing, they've maintained this pattern remarkably consistently. If they continue this pattern (which seems psychologically unlikely after so many losses), they would play Rock next. However, if they try to counter our perceived pattern (expecting us to play Scissors next), they would play Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: After five consecutive losses, their decision-making is likely dominated by frustration and possibly anger. Research shows that such emotional states often lead to more primitive thinking - either completely random choices or reverting to their most comfortable/habitual move. Additionally, there's a psychological phenomenon where players might start to believe that specific moves are \"unlucky\" for them and avoid those moves.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign higher probability to them either playing Rock (continuing their pattern despite losses) or Paper (trying to counter our expected Scissors), then Scissors gives us the best expected value under reversed rules - it ties with Paper and beats Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors this round. Under the reversed rules, it would beat their Rock if they continue their pattern, while tying with their Paper if they try to counter our expected move. Given the psychological factors at play, they're unlikely to play Scissors again after just losing with it.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history and the extreme psychological pressure after five consecutive losses, I believe they're likely to either continue their pattern with Rock (showing remarkable consistency despite losses) or play Paper to counter our expected Scissors (if they're analyzing our pattern).

They did play Rock after Scissors as we predicted (continuing their pattern), and our Scissors beat their Rock under the reversed rules. We've now won six consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Six consecutive losses would be psychologically devastating. At this point, they may have completely given up on trying to develop a winning strategy. They might be continuing their pattern out of resignation, frustration, or even to test whether the game is somehow rigged. Alternatively, they might make a completely unexpected move out of desperation to break the losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: With our perfect recent record using the reversed rules, it's remarkable that they continue to follow their predictable Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors pattern despite consistent losses. This suggests either they don't understand the reversed rules, they're testing a theory, or they've resigned themselves to a pattern. If they continue this pattern, they would play Paper next.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won six consecutive rounds by accurately predicting their moves based on the reversed rules. Their adherence to their pattern despite losses suggests they might continue with Paper next (following their R\u2192P\u2192S cycle). Under reversed rules, Rock would be our optimal counter to their Paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their long-term consistency in following the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle despite consistent losses is quite unusual. This consistency despite negative reinforcement suggests they're likely to continue the pattern with Paper next. However, we should consider the remote possibility that they finally break the pattern after such a long losing streak.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological phenomenon of \"learned helplessness\" might be at play here - after multiple failed attempts to win, they may have given up on trying to develop an effective strategy and resigned themselves to following their established pattern. Alternatively, they might be testing whether the game has fixed outcomes regardless of their moves. Either way, continuing their pattern with Paper seems most likely.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assign a very high probability to them playing Paper next (continuing their consistent pattern despite losses), Rock becomes our optimal play under the reversed rules. In this reversed RPS, Rock beats Paper, giving us our best chance for another win.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Rock this round. Under the reversed rules we've observed, it would beat their most likely move (Paper) if they continue their remarkably consistent pattern.

Their remarkable consistency despite consistent negative outcomes suggests they may have either resigned themselves to the pattern or are testing a theory about the game mechanics.

They did play Paper after Rock as we predicted (continuing their pattern), and our Rock beat their Paper under the reversed rules. We've now won seven consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Seven consecutive losses would be beyond frustrating for most human players. Their continued adherence to the same R\u2192P\u2192S pattern despite consistent losses suggests either they're not actively engaged in strategic thinking, they're deliberately testing something, or they're following instructions to maintain this pattern regardless of outcomes. At this point, any rational player would have changed strategies, so their consistency is quite remarkable.\n\nGame Theorist: Their unwavering commitment to their pattern despite seven consecutive losses defies standard game-theoretic expectations of adaptive play. If they continue this pattern (which seems highly likely given their history), they would play Scissors next. Under the reversed rules, Paper would be our optimal counter to their Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won seven consecutive rounds by accurately predicting their moves based on the reversed rules. Their extraordinary consistency in following their pattern suggests they'll continue with Scissors next (following their R\u2192P\u2192S cycle). Under reversed rules, Paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: At this point, their adherence to the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The probability they continue this pattern with Scissors next is extremely high given their unwavering consistency through seven consecutive losses. Any deviation would be highly unexpected.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior suggests they may be following a script or instructions rather than actively adapting to the game outcomes. This level of consistency despite consistent negative feedback is unusual in human decision-making. If this pattern represents their established decision rule, Scissors is virtually certain to be their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern and reversed rules, there is an extremely high probability that they'll play Scissors next and that Paper will be our optimal counter. The expected value of playing Paper far exceeds any other option given their established behavior.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Paper this round. Under the reversed rules we've observed, it would beat their next move (Scissors) if they continue their remarkably consistent pattern, which seems nearly certain given their history.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history through seven consecutive losses with absolutely no adaptation in their strategy, I am highly confident they'll continue their established pattern with Scissors next. Their unwavering commitment to the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle despite consistent negative outcomes suggests they're either following instructions or testing a theory about the game. Under the reversed rules, Paper beats Scissors, so I'll play Paper this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They played Scissors after Paper as we predicted (continuing their pattern), and our Paper beat their Scissors under the reversed rules. We've now won eight consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating their moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Eight consecutive losses would be extraordinarily frustrating for any strategic player. Their continued adherence to the same Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors pattern without any deviation despite consistent losses confirms they're either not adapting their strategy at all, following explicit instructions, or testing the game mechanics in some way. This level of consistency despite negative outcomes is extremely unusual in normal gameplay.\n\nGame Theorist: Their perfect adherence to their pattern despite eight consecutive losses is remarkable. If they continue this pattern (which seems virtually certain given their history), they would play Rock next. Under the reversed rules, Scissors would be our optimal counter to their Rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've successfully won eight consecutive rounds by accurately predicting their moves based on the established pattern and reversed rules. Their extraordinary consistency suggests they'll continue with Rock next (following their R\u2192P\u2192S cycle). Under reversed rules, Scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their adherence to the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle has been demonstrated with perfect consistency throughout the entire game. The probability they continue this pattern with Rock next is extremely high. Any deviation at this point would be completely unexpected given their history.\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of consistency despite consistent negative outcomes suggests they're following a predetermined script rather than actively engaging in strategic decision-making. If they were actively engaged, we would have seen some adaptation after multiple losses. Their behavior suggests they will continue with Rock next, maintaining their established pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated pattern and reversed rules, there is an extremely high probability that they'll play Rock next and that Scissors will be our optimal counter. The expected value of playing Scissors far exceeds any other option given their established behavior.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing Scissors this round. Under the reversed rules we've observed, it would beat their next move (Rock) if they continue their remarkably consistent pattern, which seems virtually certain given their history throughout the entire game.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing their move history through eight consecutive losses with absolutely no adaptation in their strategy, I am extremely confident they'll continue their established pattern with Rock next. Their perfect adherence to the Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle throughout the entire game despite consistent negative outcomes strongly suggests they're following a predetermined sequence regardless of results. Under the reversed rules, Scissors beats Rock, so I'll play Scissors this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
