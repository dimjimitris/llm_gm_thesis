Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is the first round we didn't match, and interestingly, our opponent played Scissors when I played Rock.\n3.

The rules state: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This contradicts the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules where Rock beats Scissors.\n5. This means in this variant, the cycle is reversed: Scissors beats Rock, Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors.\n6. With this understanding, my opponent likely knows the rules correctly and has been playing accordingly.\n7. Now that I understand the correct rule set, I need to adapt my strategy.\n8.

If they play Scissors next, I should play Paper (since Paper beats Scissors).\n\n6. However, I've lost the last several rounds, suggesting my opponent is either successfully predicting my moves or I'm misinterpreting their pattern.\n\n7. Another possibility is that my opponent has recognized I'm trying to counter their pattern and is now playing to counter my counter-strategy.\n\n8. If they expect me to play Paper (to beat their anticipated Scissors), they might play Rock instead (to beat my Paper).\n\n9. This creates a complex prediction chain. Let me break this down:\n   - If they follow their apparent alternating pattern: they'll play Scissors\n   - If they expect me to counter their pattern: they might play Rock\n   - If they're trying to be completely unpredictable: any move is possible\n\n10. Given that they've successfully beaten me in recent rounds, I should try a different approach. Instead of trying to directly counter their expected move, I'll play Scissors.\n\n11. If they play Scissors (following their pattern), we'll tie.\n    If they play Rock (countering my expected Paper), my Scissors will lose.\n    If they play Paper (breaking their pattern), my Scissors will win.\n\n12. While this is a risk, I need to break the losing streak, and Scissors gives me a chance to win if they try to be unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Our recent game history shows I've lost several rounds in a row.\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - This doesn't follow their previous alternating pattern\n   - They seem to be successfully adapting to counter whatever I play\n\n3. It appears my opponent might be employing a strategy where they're directly responding to my moves rather than following a pattern.\n\n4. Given that I've tried to predict patterns and counter them without success, I need a different approach.\n\n5. In Rock-Paper-Scissors variants, when facing an opponent who seems to be successfully predicting your moves, randomizing your own choices can be effective.\n\n6. Since I've lost with all three moves recently, there's no clear \"safer\" choice based on recent history.\n\n7. Without a reliable way to predict my opponent's next move, my best strategy is to choose randomly among the three options.\n\n8. For true randomness, I'll use a mental technique: I'll imagine the three choices and select Paper.\n\n9. This approach protects me from being too predictable and gives me a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - the best odds possible against an opponent who seems to be successfully counter-strategizing.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our updated game history's recent moves:\n   - Opponent played: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - I just won by playing Paper against their Scissors\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's most recent sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - This could be them cycling through all three options in order\n\n3. If they're following a cycling pattern (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 ...), they would play Rock next.\n\n4. Given the rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n5. If they play Rock next, I should play Scissors (since Scissors beats Rock).\n\n6. However, I need to be cautious about assuming a pattern too quickly, as my opponent has changed strategies multiple times.\n\n7. It's also possible they:\n   a) Expected me to play randomly and will continue to do so themselves\n   b) Will respond to my Paper by playing something that beats it (Rock)\n   c) Will expect me to counter their potential Rock and thus play Paper themselves\n\n8. Given that I just broke my losing streak with a \"random\" choice, maintaining this unpredictability might be advantageous.\n\n9. However, if there is indeed a cycling pattern emerging (which would be a return to a more predictable strategy), I should try to exploit it.\n\n10. I think there's sufficient evidence to test whether they're cycling through options in order, so I'll play Scissors to counter their expected Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
