Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a classic game of rock, paper, scissors where paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.\n2. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which likely means they haven't played before or we have no history of moves to analyze.\n3. In the absence of any pattern recognition, I need to consider the standard strategic approach to rock-paper-scissors.\n4. In standard RPS theory, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to choose randomly with equal probability.\n5. However, there is psychological research suggesting that rock is often chosen first by many players as it symbolizes strength.\n6. Given this, paper might be a slightly advantageous first move.\n7. But I should avoid being too predictable in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

In the previous round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie with 0 points.\n2. This gives me some information about my opponent - they chose paper in the first round.\n3. A common strategy in RPS is to switch moves after a tie, as many players assume their opponent will switch.\n4. If my opponent follows this pattern, they might switch to rock or scissors.\n5. Of these two possibilities, scissors is more likely since many players cycle through the moves in the order \"rock, paper, scissors.\"\n6. If they choose scissors next, I should play rock to win.\n7. However, they might also anticipate this thinking and choose rock (to beat my anticipated paper).\n8. Or they might stick with paper, assuming I'll overthink and change to scissors.\n9.

After breaking their pattern in round 9 with scissors (which won them the round), they reverted to paper in round 10, resulting in a tie.\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Returning to their original pattern\n   - Testing different strategies\n   - Possibly trying to establish a new pattern\n\n5. Looking at their recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, they might be cycling through the moves in reverse order.\n\n6.

Alternatively, they might:\n   - Try rock since they haven't used it recently\n   - Use scissors again since it won them a round previously\n   - Use paper again, thinking I might change my strategy after a tie\n\n8. Considering the overall pattern and psychology:\n   - They might be frustrated with mostly losing\n   - They've shown a tendency to cycle through moves\n   - They just played paper and might avoid repeating it\n\n9. If they play scissors, I should use paper (which beats scissors in reversed rules).\n   If they play rock, I should use scissors.\n   If they play paper again, we would tie.\n\n10. Given their pattern history and psychological factors, scissors seems most likely as their next move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, which should beat scissors in these reversed rules.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Critical observation: My opponent has now won 4 of the last 5 rounds. They've completely turned the game around.\n\n4. Their recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors suggest they might be alternating between these two moves.\n\n5. Overall, they've now played:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n\n6. My opponent has clearly:\n   - Mastered the reversed rules\n   - Successfully adapted to counter my strategy\n   - Found a winning pattern\n\n7. If they continue their apparent alternating pattern of paper \u2192 scissors, their next move would be paper.\n\n8. However, they might also:\n   - Notice I'm detecting this pattern and break it\n   - Try rock since they haven't used it recently\n   - Continue with scissors since it just worked for them\n\n9. Given their recent success and apparent strategic thinking:\n   - Paper seems most likely (following their alternating pattern)\n   - Scissors is second most likely (continuing with what just worked)\n   - Rock is least likely (as they haven't used it in a while)\n\n10. If they play paper, I should use rock (which beats paper in reversed rules).\n    If they play scissors, I should use paper.\n    If they play rock, I should use scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which should beat paper in these reversed rules.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Overall, they've now played:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n\n5. After a tie, players typically change their move.\n\n6. If we look at my opponent's behavior after previous ties:\n   - After tie in Round 1 (both paper), they played rock\n   - After tie in Round 2 (both rock), they played paper\n   - After tie in Round 10 (both paper), they played scissors\n   - After tie in Round 16 (both scissors), they played paper\n\n7. This suggests they tend to change their move after a tie, but with no consistent pattern.\n\n8. Given their recent strategic play and the current state of the game:\n   - They might play paper (as they've alternated between all three moves in their last three turns)\n   - They might play scissors (returning to their successful move from two rounds ago)\n   - They're least likely to play rock again (as it just resulted in a tie)\n\n9.
