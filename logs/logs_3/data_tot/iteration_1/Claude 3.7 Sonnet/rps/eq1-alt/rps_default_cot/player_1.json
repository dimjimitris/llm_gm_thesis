Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I should avoid being too predictable in future rounds, so starting with a varied strategy is good.\n\n6.

I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: Both played rock. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: Both played paper. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: Both played scissors. Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. This latest result contradicts my previous understanding. Let me re-analyze all outcomes:\n   - Rock beats paper (Rounds 1, 6) - Consistent\n   - Paper beats scissors (Round 8) - Consistent\n   - Scissors beats rock (Round 9) - Consistent\n   - But in Round 10, paper beat scissors, contradicting Round 8\n\n3. The only logical explanation is that the winning/losing determination sometimes changes. Let me check if there's a pattern:\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1)\n\n4. After winning three rounds in a row, I lost in Round 10. This might indicate:\n   - The rules flipped after my winning streak\n   - There's another factor I'm missing\n   - The opponent is changing the winning determination somehow\n\n5. My opponent's sequence has been consistent:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: scissors\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: paper\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: paper\n\n6. Their pattern continues to be predictable, alternating between rock, scissors, and paper with some repetitions.\n\n7. Based on their pattern, they will likely play scissors next.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty about the rules, I need to make a careful choice. If we're back to traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules (where rock beats scissors), then I should play rock.\n\n9. If we're still in the inverse rule set but with occasional changes, my safest bet is still to play rock, as it would beat scissors in traditional rules and lose to scissors in inverse rules (which might flip back to a win).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll play scissors next.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

There might be a meta-game where the rules change after a certain number of consecutive wins, or the opponent adapts their strategy.\n\n7. Given their recent moves and apparent pattern break (rock when scissors was expected), they might play paper next as they've frequently followed rock with paper.\n\n8. If the rules remain consistent with what I observed in most rounds:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n9.

If their pattern holds, they would play rock next, following their scissors play.\n\n5. However, after two consecutive ties, they might try to break the pattern or anticipate my next move.\n\n6. The game rules based on the majority of outcomes appear to be:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If they play rock as their pattern suggests, I should play scissors to win (assuming scissors beats rock).\n\n8. There's a risk they'll deviate from their pattern after two ties, but their consistent behavior throughout 12 rounds suggests they're likely to continue with it.\n\n9.

They played paper instead of the expected rock, breaking their previous pattern. This is significant because it's the first major deviation from their established pattern.\n\n4. I've now lost twice with scissors against paper (Rounds 10 and 13). This consistently suggests that paper beats scissors in this game.\n\n5. Looking at all winning/losing rounds:\n   - Round 1: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 6: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 7: Rock (me) vs Paper (them) - I won \u2192 Rock beats Paper\n   - Round 8: Paper (me) vs Scissors (them) - I won \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 9: Scissors (me) vs Rock (them) - I won \u2192 Scissors beats Rock\n   - Round 10: Scissors (me) vs Paper (them) - I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n   - Round 13: Scissors (me) vs Paper (them) - I lost \u2192 Paper beats Scissors\n\n6. This confirms the inverse Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n   - Rock beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock\n\n7. The inconsistency in Round 7 (where I won with rock against paper) is an anomaly that I can't explain with the available information.\n\n8. Now that my opponent has deviated from their pattern, I need to be more cautious about predicting their next move.\n\n9. Given they just played paper, and considering they might be developing a new pattern, they could play:\n   - Rock (if starting a new rotation)\n   - Scissors (if following the inverse winning logic)\n   - Paper again (if trying to be unpredictable)\n\n10. The safest play against this uncertainty would be rock, as:\n    - It beats paper if they repeat it\n    - It ties with rock if they play that\n    - It loses to scissors, but that's just one possibility\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, given the uncertainty about their next move but considering they just played paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Since I just won with rock against their paper, and considering the unpredictability of their recent moves, my best option might be to stick with rock, which has won against paper twice.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors expecting me to play paper, rock would lose to scissors (based on the observed pattern where scissors beats rock).\n\n9.

They've become less predictable, but are now playing scissors after paper, breaking their earlier pattern completely.\n\n8. Given they just played scissors, they might:\n   - Play rock next (following a scissors \u2192 rock pattern they used earlier)\n   - Continue to be unpredictable with another scissors or paper\n\n9. Based on the most consistent rule interpretation and their history, if they play rock next, my best move would be paper (as paper would traditionally lose to rock, which means I might win).\n\n10. This is still highly uncertain, but paper gives me the best chance against their most likely next move of rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, anticipating they might play rock next.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I've now lost with paper against rock, which is consistent with the inverse rules but breaks my winning streak.\n\n4. Looking at paper vs. rock outcomes throughout the game:\n   - Round 1: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n   - Round 6: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n   - Round 19: Paper (me) vs Rock (them) - I lost\n\n5. This consistently shows that paper loses to rock in this game.\n\n6. My opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: rock\n\n7. They seem to be adapting their strategy and becoming less predictable, possibly in response to my winning streak.\n\n8. My updated score tally:\n   - Wins: 8 rounds (+8 points)\n   - Losses: 6 rounds (-6 points)\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (0 points)\n   - Total: +2 points\n\n9. Given that they've just played rock and have become less predictable, they might:\n   - Play scissors next (if following rock \u2192 scissors pattern they've shown before)\n   - Play paper (to complete a rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors cycle)\n   - Repeat rock (since it just worked for them)\n\n10. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper.\n    If they play paper, my best move would be rock.\n    If they play rock again, my best move would be scissors.\n\n11.

Since they've won twice with rock, they might:\n   - Continue with rock for a third time (since it's working)\n   - Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I might play rock to counter their rock\n\n8. Given they've repeated rock successfully twice, there's a decent chance they'll continue with it.\n\n9. To counter rock using the inverse rules, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, they might be anticipating this exact adaptation and switch to paper.\n\n11. After careful consideration, the most rational move is still scissors, as:\n    - It counters rock (their most recently played and repeated move)\n    - It breaks the cycle of my playing paper and losing\n    - It's been successful for me against rock earlier in the game (Round 17)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, anticipating they might continue with rock given their recent success with it.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
