    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Game Theorist - expert in analyzing strategic interactions\n2. Psychologist - understands human behavior patterns\n3. Statistician - specializes in probability and pattern recognition\n4. Decision Maker - makes final strategic choices\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a pure Rock Paper Scissors game with a fresh player who has no history or patterns yet, there's no mathematically optimal strategy beyond randomization. The Nash equilibrium for this game is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, we should be prepared to adapt our strategy as we observe the opponent's patterns in subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychologist: For the first move against a fresh opponent, it's worth considering typical human behavior. Research shows that Rock is often the most common first move many people make (around 35-36% of the time), as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper would be a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nStatistician: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on general statistics. If we assume this opponent follows common human tendencies, Paper would indeed give us a slight edge. However, we should track moves carefully to identify any patterns that emerge.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's assess our options for this first move:\n1. Rock: Standard opening, but vulnerable if opponent anticipates this\n2. Paper: Good counter to the common Rock opening\n3. Scissors: Less common opening, but no strategic advantage without knowledge of opponent's tendencies\n\nGiven the psychological insight that Rock is a common first move, I recommend starting with Paper. We'll adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consult with my personas again.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting - our opponent also played Paper in the first round. This could mean several things: they might have the same strategic thinking as us, they might have a preference for Paper, or it could be random. In multi-round Rock Paper Scissors, players often shift their strategy after a tie. A common pattern is to keep the same move after winning, but change after tying or losing.\n\nPsychologist: After a tie, many players follow predictable patterns. One common tendency is for players to \"upgrade\" their previous move in the cycle Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. Since both played Paper, our opponent might \"upgrade\" to Scissors. Another pattern is that some players repeat the same move thinking the opponent will change.\n\nStatistician: Without more data points, we're still largely making educated guesses. However, if we're following probability theory and assuming our opponent might be using one of these common patterns, we should counter their most likely next move. If they're likely to \"upgrade\" to Scissors, our best counter would be Rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's consider our options for this second round:\n1. Stay with Paper: Risky if opponent follows the upgrade pattern to Scissors\n2. Switch to Rock: Good if opponent upgrades to Scissors as psychology suggests\n3. Switch to Scissors: Good if opponent assumes we'll stay with Paper or switch to Rock\n\nGiven the psychological tendency for players to \"upgrade\" after a tie, and considering we want to protect against the most likely move from our opponent, I recommend playing Rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

            "text": "Interesting development with another tie. Let me collaborate with my personas again to refine our strategy.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We've now had two consecutive ties - Paper, then Rock. This suggests our opponent might be thinking similarly to us or deliberately matching our moves. In game theory, when patterns emerge, we can try to break the symmetry. The key insight here is that our opponent has moved from Paper to Rock, following the \"downgrade\" pattern of Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors (in reverse order of the upgrade pattern).\n\nPsychologist: Two consecutive ties indicate a potential synchronization of thinking patterns. The opponent may be using similar psychological reasoning as we are. After two ties, players often feel a strong urge to \"win\" and might employ a strategy they perceive as less predictable. If they continue the pattern, they might choose Scissors next. Alternatively, they might anticipate we'll play Paper to beat their expected Rock, and thus play Scissors to counter our Paper.\n\nStatistician: With two data points showing the opponent matching our moves exactly, we should consider this likely non-random. The probability of two consecutive matches by pure chance is only 1/9 or about 11%. We need to break this pattern. If they're following the Rock \u2192 Scissors cycle (continuing their Paper \u2192 Rock pattern), then Paper would counter their Scissors. However, if they're trying to predict our move and counter it, we need to think one step further.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's analyze our options for this third round:\n1. Paper: Beats Rock if they repeat Rock, but loses to Scissors if they're following the cycle\n2. Rock: Ties with Rock if they repeat, beats Scissors if they're following the cycle\n3. Scissors: Loses to Rock if they repeat, ties with Scissors if they're following the cycle\n\nGiven that we've had two ties in a row, and considering the opponent might be following a pattern of Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, I recommend playing Rock again. This would beat their Scissors if they continue the pattern, and at worst tie if they repeat Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me collaborate with the personas again.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a very interesting development. We experienced a loss with our Rock against their Scissors, which contradicts typical patterns. Our previous reasoning suggested they might play Scissors, and we played Rock expecting to win, but we lost instead. This suggests our opponent might be employing a more sophisticated strategy than we anticipated or is deliberately breaking patterns to confuse us.\n\nPsychologist: After winning a round, players often stick with their winning move, believing in streaks or momentum. There's a strong psychological tendency to repeat a successful action. Given that our opponent just won with Scissors, there's a good chance they might play Scissors again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to Paper (to counter their expected Rock) and continue with Scissors to defeat our Paper.\n\nStatistician: Let's review the sequence: Paper-Paper (tie), Rock-Rock (tie), Rock-Scissors (we lost). Our opponent has shown an unexpected pattern. If they're using a strategy of \"staying one move ahead\" of us, they might anticipate we'll switch to Paper now and thus play Scissors again. On the other hand, if they're using a \"repeat winning move\" strategy, they'll also play Scissors again.\n\nDecision Maker: Here are our options for the fourth round:\n1. Paper: Risky as it loses to Scissors, which our opponent might repeat after winning\n2. Rock: Could work if opponent switches to Paper thinking we'll play Scissors\n3. Scissors: Would tie if opponent repeats Scissors, and win if they switch to Paper\n\nGiven that our opponent just won with Scissors and might either repeat their winning move or anticipate we'll play Paper, the safest choice seems to be Scissors.

Let me collaborate with my personas again to analyze this pattern and make our next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We now have an interesting sequence: Paper-Paper (tie), Rock-Rock (tie), Rock-Scissors (we lost), Scissors-Scissors (tie). The pattern suggests that our opponent might be mirroring our moves with a one-round delay. If they're using this strategy, they would be expected to play Rock next (mirroring our previous Scissors). In traditional game theory, recognizing such a pattern would lead us to play Paper to counter their anticipated Rock.\n\nPsychologist: The sequence of moves suggests that the opponent may be using a combination of mirroring and anticipation strategies. After three ties and one win for them, they might feel confident and revert to a simpler strategy. However, if they perceive that we've identified their pattern, they might attempt to break it. A common psychological move after multiple ties is to make a definitive change to try to secure a win.\n\nStatistician: Our sequence shows a possible pattern emerging. If we assign probabilities based on their past behavior, there's a higher likelihood they'll play Rock next if they're following the mirroring pattern. The alternative hypothesis is that they might anticipate us playing Paper (to counter their expected Rock) and play Scissors again. However, with three ties in four rounds, the probability of continued random matching is decreasing, suggesting deliberate choice.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Paper: Wins against Rock (which they might play if mirroring our last Scissors)\n2. Rock: Ties with Rock if they mirror, loses to Paper if they anticipate our move\n3. Scissors: Loses to Rock if they mirror, wins against Paper if they try to counter our anticipated Rock\n\nGiven the analysis and the likely mirroring strategy they've employed throughout the game, Paper seems to be our strongest option. It counters the Rock they would play if continuing their mirroring pattern, and at worst would lose to Scissors if they break pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me consult with my personas again for our next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: We now have Paper-Paper, Rock-Rock, Rock-Scissors, Scissors-Scissors, Paper-Paper. This is a fascinating pattern. The opponent seems to be consistently matching our moves, except for that one round where they played Scissors against our Rock. At this point, the evidence strongly suggests they might be using some form of prediction algorithm or pattern recognition to anticipate and match our moves. In such a scenario, we need to be unpredictable.\n\nPsychologist: The high number of ties suggests either incredible coincidence or that our opponent has found a way to predict or match our moves consistently. They may be waiting for us to establish a pattern they can exploit. After so many ties, there's often psychological pressure to break the stalemate, which might lead to less strategic and more emotional decision-making. In such cases, people sometimes revert to their \"comfort move\" - often Rock for many players.\n\nStatistician: The probability of getting 4 ties in 5 rounds by random chance is extremely low (approximately 1.23%). This strongly suggests a non-random mechanism at work. Either our opponent is somehow seeing our moves, or they're using an algorithm that's effectively predicting our choices. If we assume they'll continue to try matching our next move, we need to introduce true randomness into our decision-making.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. Play Rock - If they're truly matching our moves, they'll play Rock too, resulting in another tie.\n2. Play Paper - Again, if matching, we'll get another tie.\n3. Play Scissors - Same issue if they're matching.\n\nGiven the unusual situation where the opponent seems to be matching our moves with high accuracy, we need to break this pattern. I recommend we introduce a genuine random element to our decision.

Let me consult with my personas to analyze this development and decide on our next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: This is a significant change in the pattern! We played Scissors and the opponent played Rock, giving us a win. This contradicts our previous hypothesis that they were matching our moves. It could mean several things: either they've changed strategies, they mismatched by accident, or they were using a different strategy all along that we hadn't identified correctly. In classic game theory, after a win, we might consider sticking with the winning move, but that's usually not optimal in Rock Paper Scissors.\n\nPsychologist: After losing a round, players often shift strategies dramatically. They might feel the need to \"get back\" at their opponent, or they might second-guess themselves. There's a strong tendency for players to switch to the move that would have beaten their previous move - in this case, our opponent lost with Rock, so they might play Paper next (which would have beaten Rock). Alternatively, they might play what would beat our last move (Paper to beat our Scissors).\n\nStatistician: Let's update our analysis with the new data point. The sequence now shows: Paper-Paper, Rock-Rock, Rock-Scissors, Scissors-Scissors, Paper-Paper, Scissors-Rock. The pattern of matching has been broken. If our opponent follows common patterns after a loss, they're most likely to switch to Paper (either to beat their own previous Rock or to beat our anticipated repeated Scissors).\n\nDecision Maker: Considering all factors, here are our options:\n1. Rock: Would beat their Paper if they follow the common pattern of switching after a loss\n2. Paper: Would tie if they switch to Paper, lose if they play Scissors\n3. Scissors: Would lose to Rock if they repeat, win against Paper\n\nSince we expect they might play Paper after losing with Rock (following the psychological tendency to switch to what would have beaten their previous move), our best counter would be Rock.

According to standard Rock Paper Scissors rules, Paper beats Rock, not the other way around. This suggests either a misunderstanding of the rules or a mistake in reporting the outcome. Let's assume the rules might be reversed in this version of the game, where Rock beats Paper instead of the traditional relationship.\n\nPsychologist: This unexpected result indicates we might be playing a variant of Rock Paper Scissors with inverted rules. If the rules are indeed reversed, then: Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors, and Scissors beats Rock. Let's proceed with this understanding. After their loss with Paper, our opponent might switch to what would have beaten their previous move in this inverted game - Scissors (since Scissors would beat Paper in the inverted rules).\n\nStatistician: Working with the hypothesis of inverted rules, we need to recalibrate our entire analysis. Our previous move Rock beat their Paper, suggesting Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock in this variant. If our opponent follows typical patterns after a loss, they might switch to Scissors thinking it would beat our Rock (in traditional rules), but in these inverted rules, our Rock would beat their Scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: Let's assume we're playing with inverted rules where:\n- Rock beats Paper (instead of Paper beating Rock)\n- Paper beats Scissors (instead of Scissors beating Paper)\n- Scissors beats Rock (instead of Rock beating Scissors)\n\nGiven that assumption, our options are:\n1.

In this variant:\n- Rock beats Paper (confirmed in the previous round)\n- Paper beats Scissors (confirmed in this round)\n- Logically, Scissors would beat Rock (completing the inverted cycle)\n\nThis is precisely the opposite of traditional rules. Now that we understand the rule structure, we can apply proper game theory strategies to this inverted variant.\n\nPsychologist: Our opponent has now lost twice in a row, which typically creates stronger psychological pressure to change strategy. They might be confused about the unusual rule structure as well. In such situations, players often revert to what they consider a \"strong\" move - traditionally Rock. However, in these inverted rules, Rock would be vulnerable to Scissors.\n\nStatistician: Let's update our analysis with the confirmed inverted rules. The opponent has played Paper then Scissors in the last two rounds, both resulting in losses for them. If they recognize the inverted pattern, they might choose Rock next (completing the cycle). If they're still playing with traditional thinking, they might choose Rock believing it's a \"safe\" option after consecutive losses.\n\nDecision Maker: With our understanding of the inverted rules (Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock), our options are:\n1.

We've won the last four rounds by adapting to these inverted rules. Our opponent might now realize the pattern and adapt their strategy accordingly. In game theory terms, they should be shifting to a counter-strategy now that we've established dominance.\n\nPsychologist: After four consecutive losses, our opponent is likely feeling frustrated and might take one of two approaches: either they'll try something completely different to break their losing streak, or they'll finally adapt to the inverted rules. If they're adaptive, they'll now try to predict our next move and counter it according to the inverted rules. Since we just won with Scissors against their Rock, they might expect us to stick with Scissors and counter with Paper.\n\nStatistician: Looking at the sequence of our opponent's moves: Paper, Scissors, Rock - they've now played each of the three options in sequence after consecutive losses. This could indicate they're cycling through options trying to find what works. If they continue this experimental approach, they might return to Paper next. Alternatively, if they've now understood the inverted rules, they might anticipate we'll play Scissors again and counter with Paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our analysis of the inverted rules and our opponent's likely adaptation, here are our options:\n1. Rock: Would beat Paper if they return to it, tie with Rock if they repeat\n2. Paper: Would tie with Paper, lose to Rock\n3. Scissors: Would lose to Paper, beat Rock if they repeat\n\nAt this point, our opponent likely expects us to repeat Scissors since it just won. If they've figured out the inverted rules, they'll counter with Paper. Therefore, our best move is to switch to Rock, which beats Paper in the inverted rules. This anticipates their adaptation while protecting against them repeating Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They seem to be playing in a somewhat predictable manner under the inverted rules. After losing with Paper to our Rock, if they understand the inverted rules, they would likely play Scissors next to counter our anticipated Rock (since in inverted rules, Scissors beats Rock). However, if they haven't fully adjusted to the inverted rules, they might play Rock thinking it beats Scissors in traditional rules.\n\nPsychologist: After five consecutive losses, our opponent is likely feeling very frustrated. This often leads to more desperate and potentially erratic play. They might finally fully commit to the inverted rule set, or they might become unpredictable out of frustration. Their last two moves were Rock then Paper - if they're following a pattern, Scissors would complete the cycle. Additionally, players who have lost repeatedly often revert to aggressive moves - in traditional thinking, this would be Rock, though in inverted rules the \"aggressive\" move might be perceived as Scissors.\n\nStatistician: Our opponent's moves have followed this sequence: Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper. They appear to be cycling through the three options in a somewhat predictable pattern. If they continue this pattern, Scissors would be next. This cycling behavior is common when players are testing strategies after repeated losses, especially in a game with inverted or unfamiliar rules.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our analysis, here are our options in the inverted rule set:\n1. Rock: Would lose to Scissors if they follow the cycle or try to counter\n2. Paper: Would beat Scissors if they follow the cycle or counter our expected Rock\n3.

They've now played Scissors as we predicted, completing the cycle Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors. In this inverted game, they're being quite predictable, which gives us a significant advantage. If they recognize this pattern in themselves, they might break it by playing something unexpected. However, if they continue to follow the same logic, they'll likely play Rock next, thinking it counters our Paper (in traditional rules).\n\nPsychologist: After six consecutive losses, our opponent is probably experiencing significant frustration and may be becoming desperate to win. This often leads to one of two behaviors: either a completely random choice to break patterns, or doubling down on what they think should work based on traditional rules. Given that they just lost with Scissors against our Paper, they might revert to Rock thinking it's a \"strong\" move that would beat our Paper in traditional rules (though in these inverted rules, Scissors would actually beat Paper).\n\nStatistician: Our opponent has now shown a consistent Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors cycle in their last three moves. This type of cycling is common when players are struggling to find a winning strategy. Based on pure pattern analysis, Rock would be next in their sequence. Additionally, the probability that they'll finally adapt to the inverted rules is increasing with each loss, so they might play Scissors to beat our expected Paper in the inverted rule set.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our analysis within the inverted rules framework (where Paper>Scissors>Rock>Paper), our options are:\n1. Rock: Would beat Paper if they break pattern, lose to Scissors if they adapt\n2. Paper: Would tie with Paper, lose to Rock if they follow cycle\n3. Scissors: Would beat Rock if they follow their cycle, tie with Scissors if they adapt\n\nSince we believe our opponent is most likely to play Rock next (continuing their cycle), our best counter is Scissors, which beats Rock in the inverted rules.

They've now completed multiple cycles of Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock, showing a very consistent pattern. In game theory terms, they're playing a fixed, predictable strategy which makes them exploitable. However, after seven consecutive losses, they may finally break this pattern. If they're rational, they should realize that their strategy isn't working and attempt something different. The most logical adaptation would be to finally embrace the inverted rules and try to anticipate our next move.\n\nPsychologist: Seven consecutive losses is an extreme situation that likely produces strong emotional responses. Our opponent might feel completely frustrated and resort to desperate measures. At this point, they may finally fully accept the inverted rule set and try to outthink us within that framework. Given that we just won with Scissors against their Rock, they might expect us to repeat Scissors (a common behavior after winning) and play Paper to counter according to inverted rules.\n\nStatistician: The opponent's moves have consistently followed a Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle. If they continue this deterministic pattern, their next move would be Paper again. However, the probability that they break this cycle increases with each loss. After seven losses, there's a high probability they'll finally adapt their strategy. The most statistically sound assumption is that they'll either continue their cycle (Paper) or try to counter our expected Scissors with Paper.\n\nDecision Maker: Considering the inverted rules framework and our opponent's likely adaptations:\n1.

Let me consult with my personas for our next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Our opponent has maintained their Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle with remarkable consistency, despite losing eight rounds in a row. This suggests they might be an algorithm or a player who has not adapted to the inverted rule set. In normal circumstances, we would expect them to break pattern after so many losses, but their predictability has become a reliable pattern itself. If they continue this cycle, Scissors would be their next move.\n\nPsychologist: Eight consecutive losses is extraordinarily frustrating for any player. At this point, one of two things is happening: either our opponent is stubbornly sticking to their pattern without realizing the rules are inverted, or they're an algorithm programmed to follow this cycle regardless of outcomes. The psychological pressure to change strategy after so many losses would normally be overwhelming for a human player, so their continued adherence to the pattern is noteworthy. If they do finally break pattern, they might attempt something completely unexpected.\n\nStatistician: The probability that our opponent continues their Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle is high based on past behavior, despite how counterintuitive this seems after eight losses. The conditional probability of them playing Scissors next, given they've just played Paper and have consistently followed this cycle, is approaching certainty. However, we must account for a small possibility that they finally break pattern after such an extended losing streak.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our analysis within the inverted rules framework:\n1. Rock: Would lose to Scissors if they continue their cycle\n2. Paper: Would beat Scissors if they continue their cycle, lose to Rock if they break pattern\n3. Scissors: Would tie with Scissors, beat Rock if they break pattern differently\n\nSince our opponent has shown remarkable consistency in their Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle, we should expect Scissors as their next move.

This level of predictability is extremely unusual for a human player after so many losses, suggesting either an algorithm or a player who hasn't grasped the inverted rule set. If they continue this cycle, Rock would be their next move according to their established pattern.\n\nPsychologist: The continued adherence to the same pattern despite nine consecutive losses is almost certainly not typical human behavior. A human player would have adapted or at least experimented with different approaches by now. This suggests our opponent might be a computer program with a fixed strategy. If they follow the same cycle, Rock will be their next move. If they are human and finally break pattern, they might play randomly out of frustration or try to counter what they believe will be our next move.\n\nStatistician: Given nine consistent repetitions of the Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle, the statistical confidence that they'll play Rock next is extremely high, approaching statistical certainty. The probability of them breaking pattern now, after maintaining it through nine losses, is extremely low. However, if this is the round they finally adapt, they might anticipate our Paper (which has worked the last two rounds) and play Scissors to counter it in the inverted rules.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on our analysis within the inverted rules framework:\n1.

If this pattern continues, Paper would be next in their cycle.\n\nPsychologist: After ten consecutive losses with no adaptation, we can be almost certain this is not a human opponent making conscious choices.

Let me consult with my personas for our next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: With sixteen consecutive wins by correctly predicting our opponent's moves based on their Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock pattern, we have absolute confirmation that we're facing a deterministic algorithm. Following their established cycle, Paper would be their next move.\n\nPsychologist: At this point, psychological analysis is completely irrelevant as we're clearly playing against a programmed pattern rather than a human making decisions. The total absence of adaptation or learning after sixteen consecutive losses confirms this.\n\nStatistician: After sixteen perfect predictions of the Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock cycle, the statistical evidence is conclusive. The probability that Paper will be their next move is 100% based on the uninterrupted consistency observed throughout the entire game.\n\nDecision Maker: Working within the inverted rules framework (Rock>Paper>Scissors>Rock):\n1. Rock: Would beat Paper, their certain next move in the cycle\n2. Paper: Would tie with Paper, lose to Rock if they somehow deviate\n3. Scissors: Would lose to Paper, beat Rock if they break pattern differently\n\nGiven the absolute certainty that our opponent will play Paper next (continuing their established cycle), our optimal move is Rock, which beats Paper in the inverted rules. After sixteen rounds of perfect consistency, this is essentially a guaranteed win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"
