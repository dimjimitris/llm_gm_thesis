Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In standard rock-paper-scissors, with no additional information, each move has equal expected value.\n3. However, there are some psychological tendencies in RPS.

However, if my opponent is also thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n6.

The opponent has finally broken their alternating pattern in the last round. Instead of the expected paper, they played scissors.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They realized I was exploiting their pattern\n   - They may have deliberately changed strategy\n   - They might return to their pattern or adopt a new one\n\n5. Given they broke their pattern with scissors, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might continue with new unpredictable choices\n   - They might try scissors again since it worked\n   - They might return to their alternating pattern (which would mean paper next)\n\n6. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If they play scissors again, paper would be my best counter\n8. If they return to their pattern and play paper, rock would be best\n9. If they play rock, scissors would be best\n\n10. Since they just broke their pattern with scissors and it worked for them, there's a reasonable chance they might play scissors again.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their possible scissors repeat, as they just successfully broke their pattern with scissors and might try it again.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   There's no obvious pattern, but they have switched to scissors after rock.\n\n4. According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. After their scissors move, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors (they've shown a tendency to repeat moves)\n   - Switch to paper (following some previous patterns of alternation)\n   - Switch to rock (to try to counter a potential paper move from me)\n\n6. Given that they just won with scissors, they might:\n   - Play scissors again expecting me to play paper to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors to counter their scissors\n\n7. If they repeat scissors, paper would beat it\n8. If they switch to rock, scissors would beat it\n9. If they switch to paper, rock would beat it\n\n10. Since they just had success with scissors and have shown a pattern of repeating successful moves, playing paper to counter potential repeated scissors seems most logical.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they'll repeat scissors after their successful previous round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I just won with paper against their scissors, which is consistent with our variant rules where paper beats scissors.\n\n6. After their two consecutive scissors plays, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors a third time (they've shown a pattern of playing moves up to 3 times in sequence)\n   - Switch to paper (to try something new after losing twice with scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter an anticipated scissors play from me)\n\n7. Given their tendency to repeat moves multiple times, another scissors play is possible.\n8. However, after losing with the same move twice, they might be more likely to switch.\n\n9. If they anticipate I'll play paper again (since it just won), they would likely play rock to counter it.\n10.

According to our rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. After their rock move (which just lost), my opponent might:\n   - Switch to paper (to try a different move after losing with rock)\n   - Stick with rock (they've shown a tendency to repeat moves even after losing)\n   - Play scissors (to counter an anticipated paper move from me)\n\n7. Given their pattern of sometimes switching after losses, they might switch to paper or scissors.\n8. If they switch to paper, I should play rock to win\n9. If they switch to scissors, I should play paper to win\n10. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors to win\n\n11.
