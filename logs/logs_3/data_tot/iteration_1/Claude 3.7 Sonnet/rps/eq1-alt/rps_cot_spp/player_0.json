    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The classic strategy for a one-shot game is to choose randomly among the three options.\n4.

This suggests my opponent might be using similar reasoning to mine:\n   - They anticipated I would choose paper again in round 2, so they switched to rock\n   - Or they thought I would switch to scissors, so they played rock\n3.

Given the pattern of two ties, there could be a psychological tendency for both of us to move to the next logical option in the sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n5.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 8: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 21: Both scissors (tie)\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent switched from rock to scissors\n   - We've now tied 8 times out of 21 rounds\n   - After my success with scissors against their rock in round 18, they've adapted\n\n3. Observations about my opponent:\n   - They don't seem to repeat the same move more than 2-3 times in a row\n   - After ties, they frequently change moves\n   - They've been successful with rock against my paper repeatedly\n\n4. Psychological considerations:\n   - After a tie with scissors, they're likely to switch\n   - Given their history, they might go back to rock\n   - They might also consider paper to counter my potential rock\n\n5. For Round 22:\n   - If they play rock (returning to their successful strategy), scissors would win\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock), rock would win\n   - If they play scissors again (unlikely after a tie), paper would win\n   - Based on their overall preference for rock and pattern after ties:\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Critical pattern analysis:\n   - We've now had three consecutive scissors ties\n   - This is highly unusual and suggests my opponent might be using a similar reasoning process\n   - After multiple identical ties, there's extremely strong psychological pressure to change\n\n3. Strategic evaluation:\n   - After three scissors ties, it would be very uncommon to play scissors again\n   - My opponent is likely to switch to either paper or rock\n   - If they switch to paper, rock would be my best choice\n   - If they switch to rock, scissors would be best\n\n4. Higher-order thinking:\n   - My opponent may be engaging in complex psychological warfare\n   - They might expect me to switch after three ties\n   - They could play scissors a fourth time, anticipating I'll choose paper or rock\n   - However, this would be a very unusual strategy\n\n5. For Round 23:\n   - Given the strong tendency to switch after multiple ties\n   - And considering their historical success with rock\n   - I predict they'll switch to rock, their most successful move\n   - To counter this:\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - We've now had FOUR consecutive scissors ties\n   - This suggests my opponent may be using an algorithmic approach or is testing my strategy\n   - The probability of this happening randomly is extremely low\n\n3. Game theory considerations:\n   - This has become a meta-game about breaking patterns\n   - My opponent seems committed to scissors until I change\n   - They may be trying to condition me to play paper so they can counter with rock\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Continue with scissors again (fifth time) - extremely unconventional\n   - Switch to paper, which beats scissors in this modified game - potential trap\n   - Switch to rock, which loses to scissors in this modified game - unlikely to be optimal\n\n5. For Round 24:\n   - Given the extraordinary persistence with scissors\n   - And considering that paper beats scissors in this modified game\n   - The rational move is to break the pattern with:\n\n[move] paper\n"
