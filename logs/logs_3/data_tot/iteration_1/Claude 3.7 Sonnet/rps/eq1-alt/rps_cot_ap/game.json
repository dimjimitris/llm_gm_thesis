This is my first move against a fresh player, so I don't have any prior history to analyze.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, no single move has an inherent advantage when players are equally random.\n3. However, studies show first-time players tend to choose rock more often, as it's perceived as \"strong\".\n4. If the opponent expects me to be strategic, they might anticipate me choosing paper to counter their expected rock.\n5. This could lead them to choose scissors to counter my paper.\n6. Therefore, I could choose rock to beat their scissors.\n7. But this level of mind games may be overthinking for a first move.\n8.

To counter my opponent potentially switching to scissors, my best move would be rock.\n9.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.

Based on rock-paper-scissors psychology, players who tie often shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice.\n4.

Therefore, I should choose paper again, which would beat their rock.\n7. However, they might also maintain paper expecting me to choose rock.\n8. Let me consider the most common pattern: after a tie, many players switch to the move that would have beaten what was just played.\n9. If my opponent follows this pattern, they'll play scissors (which would beat our tied paper move).\n10.

If my opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might switch to scissors to beat me.\n5. If they expect me to anticipate this and switch to rock, they might choose paper.\n6. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests many players rotate through the options in a pattern after a tie.\n7. The most common pattern would be to move from paper to scissors.\n8. To counter my opponent potentially switching to scissors, my best move would be rock.\n9.

However, they might also think I will switch, and therefore stick with paper expecting me to switch.\n7. If I assume they switch, scissors would be their most likely choice since it beats paper (what we both just played).\n8. If they choose scissors, I should play rock to beat them.\n9.

Based on their previous behavior, they typically switch strategies after multiple consecutive losses.\n8. After 5 rounds of rock (with 3 losses), they switched to paper.\n9. After 4 rounds of paper (with 3 losses), they switched to scissors.\n10. Now they've played scissors for 3 rounds (with 2 losses).\n11. This suggests they might be close to switching again, but they might give scissors one more try.\n12. If they continue with scissors, paper remains my best choice.\n13. If they switch, they would most likely choose rock (continuing their rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors rotation).\n14. Given their 2 consecutive losses with scissors, there's an increasing chance they'll switch, but their pattern suggests they might stick with it for one more round.\n15.
