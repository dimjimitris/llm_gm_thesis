This confirms they did indeed switch from scissors after losing, though they chose paper rather than rock.\n\nTheir recent moves now show:\n- Scissors (2 rounds)\n- Paper (current)\n\nThroughout the game, they've demonstrated several behavioral patterns:\n1) Willingness to stick with a move for multiple rounds\n2) Tendency to change after losses\n3) Occasional returns to paper, their original preference\n\nAfter this tie with paper, they might:\n1) Stay with paper, thinking I'll switch to scissors\n2) Switch to rock anticipating I'll play paper again\n3) Return to scissors to try to establish a new pattern\n\nSince we just tied (rather than them losing), and given their historical tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds when not losing, they might continue with paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This suggests my opponent is becoming quite adept at anticipating my moves, perhaps recognizing that I'm trying to counter their expected patterns.\n\nTheir recent moves show increasing adaptability:\n- Rock (5-round streak)\n- Scissors\n- Paper\n- Scissors\n\nThey've broken away from long streaks of the same move and are now varying their plays more frequently. This makes them less predictable. Given this new adaptive pattern and our recent tie with scissors, they might:\n1) Continue with scissors, thinking I'll switch to paper\n2) Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors again\n3) Switch to paper to counter my expected rock\n\nWith their increased unpredictability, I need to be more careful about obvious counters. Since we just tied with scissors, and they've been changing moves frequently, I think they're likely to switch again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
