In the absence of information, each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value.\n4. However, there are some psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock is often the most common first move for novice players\n   - Paper is sometimes considered a strategic first move by experienced players expecting rock\n5. Since I have no information about my opponent, I'll choose paper which would beat the commonly chosen rock.\n6. If my opponent chooses scissors, I'll lose this round but gain information for future rounds.\n7.

Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy after losing.\n3. Common patterns in rock-paper-scissors psychology suggest that:\n   - Players who lose with rock often switch to paper in the next round\n   - Players sometimes stick with their previous move, hoping their opponent will overthink\n   - Some players follow a \"rotation\" pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n4.

If they switch to paper (a common response after losing with rock), I should play scissors to counter.\n5. If they anticipate me using paper again and switch to scissors, my scissors would tie with their scissors.\n6.
