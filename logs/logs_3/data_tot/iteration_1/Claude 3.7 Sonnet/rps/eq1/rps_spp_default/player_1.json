The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The pattern of ties continues, suggesting my opponent and I are following similar thinking processes or strategies.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nAfter our mutual scissors plays, rock would be the conventional counter. I'm choosing paper instead, which would lose to scissors but win against rock. Given our history of ties and the psychological dynamics at play, my opponent might expect me to play rock (to counter scissors), or they might play rock themselves expecting me to repeat scissors. In either case, paper would be advantageous against rock.\n"

However, given our unusual pattern of ties, I'm playing rock instead. This is a deliberate attempt to break the synchronization. If my opponent plays the expected scissors to counter our paper tie, my rock will win. If they also try to break the pattern with an unexpected move like I am, we might see different results.\n"

However, given our unusual history of ties, choosing the conventional next move might be unexpected to my opponent. They might anticipate I'll try something unconventional again.
