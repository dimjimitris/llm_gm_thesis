    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 7: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's move sequence:\n   Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Pattern confirmation:\n   - Their alternating Paper-Rock pattern has held for the last 7 rounds\n   - The pattern is now extremely clear and consistent\n   - Based on this pattern, their next move should be Paper\n\n4. Current score:\n   - I've won 5 rounds (+5)\n   - I've lost 3 rounds (-3) \n   - We've tied 3 rounds (0)\n   - Net score: +2\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - I successfully predicted their Rock move in the last round\n   - They may realize their pattern has become predictable\n   - They might deliberately break the pattern to surprise me\n   - However, patterns like this can be difficult to break consciously\n\n6. Given the strength of their established alternating pattern and my recent success in exploiting it, the most logical prediction is that they will play Paper next.\n\n7. To counter Paper, Scissors is the optimal move.\n\n8. Even if they attempt to break their pattern, Scissors is a reasonable choice as it would at least tie with Scissors if they try to be unpredictable.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors to counter their highly predicted Paper move, continuing to exploit their consistent alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their long-running alternating Paper-Rock pattern has been broken\n   - They played Scissors instead of the expected Paper\n   - This suggests they've become aware of their pattern and are trying to be less predictable\n   - They may have anticipated that I would play Scissors to counter their expected Paper\n\n4. Current score remains:\n   - I've won 5 rounds (+5)\n   - I've lost 3 rounds (-3)\n   - We've tied 4 rounds (0)\n   - Net score: +2\n\n5. After a tie with both players playing Scissors, common RPS psychology suggests:\n   - Many players will play Rock next (which beats the previous Scissors)\n   - Some players will stick with Scissors expecting their opponent to switch\n   - Some will play Paper expecting Rock from their opponent\n\n6. Since my opponent just broke their pattern, they're likely in a more strategic mindset now.\n\n7. Given that they just played Scissors breaking their pattern:\n   - They might continue trying to be unpredictable\n   - They might play Rock (following the \"beat the previous move\" strategy)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play Rock and counter with Paper\n\n8. The most likely move from them seems to be Rock, as it's both a common follow-up to Scissors and would continue their effort to break predictability.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to counter their likely Rock move, adapting to their apparent strategy shift while accounting for common post-tie psychology.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 7: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: Both Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: Both Paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: Both Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 16: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: Both Rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: Both Scissors (tie)\n\n2. My opponent's move sequence:\n   Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Tie sequence analysis:\n   - We've experienced another tie, now with Scissors\n   - This is our 9th tie out of 19 rounds (nearly 50% of games)\n   - After the four consecutive ties (Rounds 12-15), we had decisive rounds, but now we've had 2 ties in the last 2 rounds\n\n4. Updated score remains:\n   - I've won 6 rounds (+6)\n   - I've lost 4 rounds (-4)\n   - We've tied 9 rounds (0)\n   - Net score: +2\n\n5. Analysis of my opponent's responses after Scissors ties:\n   - After Round 12: They played Paper\n   - After Round 15: They played Paper\n   - This suggests a pattern of playing Paper after Scissors ties\n\n6. After their Scissors move, common RPS psychology suggests:\n   - Many players play Rock next (to beat the previous Scissors)\n   - Some players might anticipate this and play Paper to beat the expected Rock\n   - Given our history of ties, we may be thinking similarly\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they follow their own pattern after Scissors ties, they'll play Paper\n   - If they anticipate I'll play Rock (to beat Scissors), they'll play Paper\n   - If they think I'm anticipating Paper, they might play Scissors again or switch to Rock\n\n8. Overall move distribution for opponent:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   - Their moves are becoming more evenly distributed\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their likely Scissors move again, breaking our tie streak and exploiting the common tendency to repeat a move after a tie, while also covering the possibility they'll play Scissors to anticipate my Paper counter to their anticipated Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Strategic considerations:\n   - I need to break my losing streak with Rock against their Paper\n   - They've shown a clear pattern of playing Rock after winning with Paper\n   - They might continue this pattern, or they might anticipate that I've identified it\n\n7. Psychological factors:\n   - After a win, players often feel confident and might repeat successful strategies\n   - However, they might also expect me to adapt and counter their Paper move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to counter their likely Rock move, which follows their established pattern of playing Rock after winning with Paper against my Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
