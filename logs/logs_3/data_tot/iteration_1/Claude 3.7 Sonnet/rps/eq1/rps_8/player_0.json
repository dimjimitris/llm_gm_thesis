    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since they've just played scissors and we tied, they might:\n- Stay with scissors thinking I'll switch to paper\n- Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors again\n- Switch to paper to try something completely different\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They've now played scissors twice in a row and lost with it this time.\n\nTheir recent moves:\n- Paper (1 round)\n- Scissors (2 rounds)\n\nThroughout the game, they've shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds, but also to switch after clear losses. Since they just lost with scissors, they'll likely change their approach. Based on their historical patterns, they might:\n\n1) Switch to rock to counter my expected scissors (thinking I'll continue with my winning move)\n2) Switch to paper to try a completely different option\n3) Less likely: stay with scissors for a third time despite the loss\n\nGiven their adaptability after losses and their psychological tendency to expect me to repeat a winning move, I think they're most likely to switch to rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
