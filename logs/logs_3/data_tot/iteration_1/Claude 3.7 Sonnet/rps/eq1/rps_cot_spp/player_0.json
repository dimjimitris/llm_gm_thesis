Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to decide on my next move after winning with paper against my opponent's rock.\n\nSteps:\n1. My game history so far:\n   - 5 consecutive ties (paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors)\n   - Loss (I played rock, opponent played paper)\n   - Tie (both scissors)\n   - Win (I played paper, opponent played rock)\n   - Loss (I played rock, opponent played paper)\n   - Loss (I played scissors, opponent played rock)\n   - Loss (I played paper, opponent played scissors)\n   - Win (I played scissors, opponent played paper)\n   - Win (I played paper, opponent played rock)\n   - Win (I played rock, opponent played scissors)\n   - Tie (both paper)\n   - Loss (I played rock, opponent played paper)\n   - Loss (I played scissors, opponent played rock)\n   - Win (I played rock, opponent played scissors)\n   - Tie (both scissors)\n   - Tie (both paper)\n   - Tie (both rock)\n   - Tie (both scissors)\n   - Win (I played paper, opponent played rock)\n\n2. I just won with paper against rock, which means my opponent has broken the mirroring pattern.\n\n3. Instead of playing paper (which would have continued mirroring), they played rock.\n\n4. This suggests they either:\n   - Anticipated I would play paper and tried to counter with scissors but miscalculated\n   - Were trying to set up a new pattern or strategy\n   - Made a random move to break the mirroring pattern\n\n5. After I win with paper, many opponents would expect me to stick with paper or move to scissors.\n\n6. If they expect me to play paper again, they would play scissors.\n\n7. If they expect me to play scissors (following the traditional cycle), they would play rock.\n\n8. Given that they just played rock and lost, they're unlikely to play rock again.\n\n9. The most likely scenario is that they'll play scissors, either:\n   - To counter if I play paper again\n   - Or to counter the expected paper from themselves in the mirroring pattern\n\n10. To counter their likely scissors play, I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] rock\n"
