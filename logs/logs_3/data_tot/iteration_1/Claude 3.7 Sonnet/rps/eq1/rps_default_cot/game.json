My opponent's recent sequence has been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (tie) \u2192 scissors (loss).\n2. They played scissors in the last round, which suggests they might have expected me to play paper.\n3. After losing with scissors, they have several possible responses:\n   - They might play rock, following the natural counter to what lost (scissors \u2192 rock)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll play rock again since it just won, and play paper to counter\n   - They might revert to a pattern or try something entirely new\n4. Looking at their broader behavior:\n   - Initially they followed very rigid patterns even when losing\n   - They eventually broke pattern and started winning\n   - Their recent moves don't show a clear new pattern yet\n5. Given their history of pattern-based play, they might be establishing a new sequence.\n6. If they're starting a new pattern with scissors, paper might follow.\n7. If they're using a reactive strategy based on the previous round, rock is likely.\n8. Paper would beat rock but lose to scissors.\n9. Rock would tie with rock but beat scissors.\n10. Since they just lost with scissors, rock seems more likely than scissors.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to play rock after losing with scissors) paper\n"
