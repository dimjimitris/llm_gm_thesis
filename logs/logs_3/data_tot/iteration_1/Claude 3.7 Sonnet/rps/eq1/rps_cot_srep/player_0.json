    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Opponent's complete sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 6 times, rock 3 times, and paper 1 time\n   - They just broke their even-round pattern by playing scissors instead of rock\n   - My cumulative score is now -3\n\n12. New pattern observations:\n   - They may have detected that I identified their odd/even pattern\n   - They've now played scissors twice in a row for the first time\n   - They heavily favor scissors (6/10 rounds)\n\n13. Psychological analysis:\n   - After successfully breaking their pattern and winning with scissors, they might continue with scissors\n   - Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll play rock to counter scissors, and switch to paper\n   - Their choice of scissors in round 10 could suggest they're now trying to be less predictable\n\n14. Given they've played scissors twice in a row and have used scissors most frequently overall, I think the most likely scenario is that they'll switch away from scissors\n\n15. If they switch from scissors, they'll play either rock or paper:\n   - Based on historical frequency, rock (3/10) is more likely than paper (1/10)\n   - If they play rock, scissors would lose\n   - If they play paper, scissors would win\n\n16. Despite the risks, rock seems like the most strategic choice for this round:\n   - Beats scissors if they play it a third time in a row\n   - Loses to paper if they make that rare choice\n   - Given their heavy preference for scissors, playing rock offers the best expected value\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at the last three rounds:\n   - Round 9: They played scissors, I won with rock\n   - Round 10: They played scissors, I lost with paper\n   - Round 11: They played paper, I lost with rock\n\n4. Their last move switching to paper was strategic - they seem to be anticipating my choices effectively\n\n5. There are two main possibilities for their strategy:\n   - They could be using a predetermined pattern that happens to work well against me\n   - They could be actively predicting my next move based on game history and psychology\n\n6. Given their success rate, the second option seems more likely\n\n7. If they're predicting my moves, they might expect:\n   - After losing with rock against paper, I'm likely to switch to scissors to beat their paper\n   - If they anticipate scissors from me, they would play rock\n\n8. Another possibility is they're using a complex rotation:\n   - Their last two moves were scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Following RPS rotation, rock would come next\n\n9. Both analyses suggest they might play rock next\n\n10. If I expect them to play rock:\n    - I should play paper to beat it\n    - However, if they're truly anticipating my moves, they might expect this and play scissors\n    - This creates a complex prediction problem\n\n11. Given their pattern of successfully countering my moves, I need to break predictability\n    - I've never played the same move three times in a row\n    - Playing scissors would be unexpected and would beat paper if they repeat their last move\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - In rounds 10-11-12, their moves were scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - This forms a perfect RPS rotation in reverse (scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors)\n\n4. Broader pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to be mixing strategies\n   - Sometimes they follow patterns (like the even-round rock pattern early on)\n   - Other times they seem to directly counter my anticipated moves\n   - They've played rock 5 times, scissors 5 times, and paper twice\n\n5. If they're following the reverse RPS rotation they just completed, they would play scissors next\n\n6. However, they might also be adaptively countering what they think I'll play next:\n   - After losing with scissors against rock, I might be expected to play rock or paper\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they'd play paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they'd play scissors\n\n7. Given their success rate, I need to consider what they would least expect:\n   - I've lost the last three rounds with paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - I've never played the same move twice in a row\n   - Playing paper again would break my own pattern of avoiding repetition\n\n8. Considering all factors:\n   - If they follow their reverse rotation: scissors would tie\n   - If they anticipate I'll play rock next: paper would lose\n   - If they anticipate I'll try something unexpected: unpredictable\n\n9. Since they've been so successful at anticipating my moves, my best strategy might be maximum unpredictability\n   - Repeatedly losing suggests they have identified patterns in my decision-making\n   - Breaking all apparent patterns is my best defense\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Their last three moves have been paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   - This completes one full cycle of all three moves\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   - The opponent seems to be extremely good at anticipating my choices\n   - They may be analyzing my thinking patterns or using some algorithmic approach\n   - I need to be less predictable and avoid any detectable patterns in my play\n\n5. Strategy reassessment:\n   - Traditional pattern recognition is failing me as the opponent is consistently one step ahead\n   - Since they've just played scissors, standard RPS thinking suggests they might expect me to play rock next\n   - If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n\n6. Alternative approach:\n   - Since trying to outthink the opponent has failed, I could try an extremely simple strategy\n   - Playing the move that would have won the previous round is a basic but sometimes effective approach\n   - In the last round, rock would have beaten their scissors\n\n7. Another consideration:\n   - The opponent has played scissors most frequently (6/13 rounds)\n   - Playing rock has the highest expected value against their historical distribution\n\n8. Weighing all factors:\n   - Given their apparent ability to predict complex thinking, a simpler approach might be more effective\n   - Rock would beat their most common historical move (scissors)\n   - Rock would have won the previous round\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - The even-round rock pattern has reasserted itself in rounds 12 and 14\n   - In odd-numbered rounds, they've played scissors 5 times and paper 2 times\n   - This round (15) is odd-numbered, suggesting scissors is more likely based on this pattern\n\n4.

Strategic assessment:\n   - Given the odd-round pattern and psychological considerations, scissors seems highly probable\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they break pattern with rock, we would tie again\n   - If they break pattern with paper (rare for them), I would lose\n\n6. Since the odd-round scissors pattern has been quite consistent (5/7 odd rounds), and the psychological dynamic also points to scissors, rock seems like the optimal move\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,12,14): They've consistently played rock (except round 10)\n   - Odd rounds: They've played scissors in rounds 1,3,7,9,13 and paper in rounds 5,11,15\n   - There may be a secondary pattern in odd rounds: paper every 5th odd round (5,11,15)\n\n4. Looking at the most recent rounds:\n   - Their last move was paper in round 15\n   - In round 16 (even), the established pattern suggests they'll play rock\n   - After playing paper, many players follow with scissors in the RPS rotation\n\n5. Evaluating the two most likely possibilities:\n   - If they follow their even-round rock pattern: paper would win\n   - If they follow a natural RPS rotation after paper: scissors would lose\n\n6.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds (2,4,6,8,12,14,16): They've played rock in 7/8 even rounds\n   - Odd rounds (1,3,7,9,13): They've played scissors in 5/9 odd rounds\n   - Odd rounds (5,11,15,17): They've played paper in 4/9 odd rounds\n   - Their last two moves were rock\u2192paper\n\n4. Important new insight:\n   - They've now played paper in odd-numbered rounds 4 times\n   - These paper plays in odd rounds are becoming more frequent in later rounds\n   - They played paper in rounds 11, 15, and 17 (three of the last four odd rounds)\n   - This suggests a possible shift in their odd-round strategy\n\n5. For round 18 (even):\n   - Their even-round rock pattern remains very strong (7/8)\n   - If they follow this pattern, they'll play rock again\n   - To beat rock, I should play paper\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play rock (most likely based on even-round pattern): paper wins\n   - If they play scissors (to break pattern): paper loses\n   - If they play paper (unlikely in even rounds): paper ties\n\n7. Despite their success in predicting my moves, their even-round rock pattern has been remarkably consistent\n   - When I trusted this pattern in round 16, I won\n   - The evidence still strongly supports rock as their most likely move for round 18\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Even rounds: Rock pattern (7/9) was broken in round 18 with paper\n   - Odd rounds: Recent trend toward paper (4/9) rather than scissors (5/9)\n   - Their last three moves were paper\u2192paper\u2192paper in rounds 15, 17, 18\n\n4. There appears to be a significant shift in their strategy:\n   - They seem to be moving away from their earlier patterns\n   - Playing paper three times in a row suggests either:\n     a) They're using a new pattern\n     b) They're adapting to counter my perceived strategy\n     c) They're introducing randomness to be less predictable\n\n5. For round 19 (odd):\n   - Given they've played paper three times in a row, they might:\n     a) Continue with paper (establishing a new pattern)\n     b) Switch to a different move (breaking the paper streak)\n\n6. If they're establishing a paper pattern, I should play scissors\n7. If they're breaking the paper streak, they'll play either rock or scissors\n   - Rock would beat my scissors\n   - Scissors would tie with my scissors\n\n8. Psychological consideration: After three papers in a row, continuing with paper becomes psychologically difficult\n   - Most players feel compelled to change after three repetitions\n   - This suggests they're more likely to break their paper streak\n\n9. Weighing the evidence:\n   - The opponent has shown adaptability\n   - Three papers in a row suggests a likely switch\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they continue the streak\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors if they choose that\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at recent rounds:\n   - Rounds 15-19: paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - They seem to be alternating between paper and rock recently, with the paper streak being an exception\n\n5. Round 20 is even-numbered:\n   - Their historical pattern for even rounds was strongly rock (7/9 even rounds)\n   - But they've become less predictable in recent rounds\n   - If they continue the recent paper/rock alternation after rock, they might play paper\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After successfully countering my scissors with rock, they might anticipate I'll switch to rock\n   - If they expect rock from me, they would play paper\n   - This would also align with the paper/rock alternation they've shown recently\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play paper: rock loses\n   - If they play rock: rock ties\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins\n\n8. Weighing all factors:\n   - Their successful countering of my moves suggests they're anticipating my choices\n   - The recent alternating pattern suggests paper is more likely than rock\n   - Paper has been increasingly frequent in their recent plays (5 of last 10 moves)\n\n9.

Opponent's sequence: scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\n   - My cumulative score is now -7\n   - They've played paper 8 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 6 times\n   - Paper has become their dominant move in recent rounds (6 of last 8)\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their last five moves: paper\u2192paper\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192paper\n   - When I won in round 22, they immediately countered with paper in round 23\n   - They seem to be favoring paper more often than their historical average\n\n4. Looking at rock-paper matchups:\n   - In rounds 5, 11, 15, 17, and 23, I played rock and they played paper (I lost)\n   - This has happened 5 times and I've lost each time\n   - They seem particularly good at anticipating when I'll play rock\n\n5. Psychological considerations:\n   - After successfully countering my rock with paper, they might expect me to switch to scissors\n   - To counter scissors, they would play rock\n   - They may also be establishing a paper-heavy strategy to condition me to play scissors\n\n6. For round 24 (even):\n   - Based on their recent paper trend, they might continue with paper\n   - However, they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter their paper trend\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they would play rock\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play paper (continuing recent trend): scissors wins\n   - If they play rock (countering anticipated scissors): scissors loses\n   - If they play scissors (breaking long-term pattern): scissors ties\n\n8. Weighing all factors:\n   - Their paper-heavy strategy has been effective\n   - They've successfully predicted my rock plays\n   - After winning with paper, they might continue with it\n   - However, they may expect me to counter with scissors\n\n9. Given their adaptive strategy and recent paper frequency, I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper play\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
