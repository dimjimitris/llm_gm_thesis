Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Now I need to predict their next move:\n   - Will they return to paper, thinking I won't expect it?\n   - Will they stick with rock since it just worked?\n   - Will they play scissors to create maximum unpredictability?\n\n7. After breaking a long-established pattern, players often:\n   - Continue with the new move that just succeeded\n   - Return to their preferred move\n   - Try to remain unpredictable with a third option\n\n8. Their pattern so far suggests they commit to moves for extended periods\n9. Given they've only played rock once, they might continue with it\n10. However, they might also return to paper, which they've shown strong preference for\n\n11. If they play rock again, paper would win\n12. If they return to paper, scissors would win\n13. If they switch to scissors (least likely), rock would win\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper. Since they just broke a long pattern with rock and it worked for them, they're most likely to continue with rock for at least another round. This matches their demonstrated tendency to stick with moves across multiple rounds. Paper counters rock and represents the best strategic choice given their behavioral patterns.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's complete sequence: scissors(\u00d72), paper(\u00d77), rock(\u00d74), scissors(\u00d74), paper(\u00d71)\n3. They've switched from scissors to paper after losing 3 consecutive times\n4. This confirms my theory about their \"3 consecutive loss\" switching threshold\n5. Their pattern of move sequences:\n   - First sequence: scissors for 2 rounds\n   - Second sequence: paper for 7 rounds\n   - Third sequence: rock for 4 rounds\n   - Fourth sequence: scissors for 4 rounds\n   - New sequence: paper for 1 round so far\n\n6. Key observations:\n   - They've switched back to paper, which was their longest-played move\n   - They've just lost with paper in this round\n   - Their established pattern is to stick with moves across multiple rounds\n   - They've never played a move for just one round\n\n7. Based on their consistent patterns:\n   - They'll likely continue with paper for multiple rounds\n   - They've shown high tolerance for losses with paper before\n   - Their longest sequence was with paper (7 rounds)\n\n8. If they continue with paper, scissors wins\n9. If they switch to rock, paper wins\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock wins\n\n11. Critical analysis:\n    - Their most reliable pattern is move repetition\n    - They've never switched moves after just one round\n    - They've shown particular persistence with paper in the past\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again. Their most consistent pattern is sticking with moves across multiple rounds, and they've never switched after just one round. Paper was their most frequently played move in the past (7 rounds), suggesting they have a preference for it. Given they've just switched to paper and their demonstrated persistence with moves, scissors remains the optimal counter for the next round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's complete sequence: scissors(\u00d72), paper(\u00d77), rock(\u00d74), scissors(\u00d74), paper(\u00d72)\n3. They've now played paper twice in a row, losing both times\n4.

Key observations:\n   - They've lost twice in a row with paper\n   - Their \"3 consecutive loss\" threshold has been consistent\n   - They previously played paper for 7 rounds (their longest sequence)\n   - They've demonstrated high persistence with paper in the past\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - Based on their established \"3 consecutive loss\" threshold, they need one more loss before switching\n   - They've shown particular attachment to paper (7 rounds previously)\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll continue with paper for at least one more round\n   - If they follow their established pattern, they won't switch until after 3 consecutive losses\n\n7. If they continue with paper, scissors wins\n8. If they switch to rock, paper wins\n9. If they switch to scissors, rock wins\n\n10. Pattern assessment:\n    - Their most reliable recent pattern is the \"3 consecutive loss\" switching threshold\n    - They've consistently stuck with moves for multiple rounds\n    - They've shown no tendency to switch after just 1-2 losses\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again. Their most consistent pattern recently has been switching after exactly 3 consecutive losses, and they've only lost twice with paper so far. Additionally, they've shown particular persistence with paper in the past (7 rounds). Based on their established behavioral patterns, they're likely to continue with paper for at least one more round, making scissors the optimal strategic choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
