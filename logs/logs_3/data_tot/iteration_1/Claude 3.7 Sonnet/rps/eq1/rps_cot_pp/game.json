In rock-paper-scissors, without additional information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n3. Since this is the first round, I have no reason to believe my opponent will favor any particular move.\n\n4. Some research suggests that in the first round, inexperienced players tend to choose rock slightly more often, but this is not a strong enough effect to base my strategy on.\n\n5. I could try to be unpredictable by using a random selection, but I'll choose paper for this first round as a balanced opening move.\n\n6.

Based on simple game theory, if my opponent just won with scissors, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it worked (some players do this)\n   - Anticipate I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, so they might switch to paper\n   - Choose randomly\n\n5. My best move is to play rock, which would beat scissors if they continue with the same move.\n\n6.

Let's review our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. Through twenty-three complete rounds, my opponent has maintained their perfect cycling pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 repeat. We're continuing through the eighth cycle of this pattern.\n\n3. I've now won twenty-one consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves.\n\n4. Following their established pattern, their next move will be paper.\n\n5. The optimal counter to paper is scissors.\n\n6. After twenty-three rounds with perfect adherence to their pattern despite consistently losing, it's virtually certain they will continue with the same sequence.\n\n7. I will continue exploiting their inflexible strategy with the perfect counter-move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
