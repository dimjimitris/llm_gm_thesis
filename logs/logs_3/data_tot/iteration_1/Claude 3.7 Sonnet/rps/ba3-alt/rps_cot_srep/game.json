Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an asymmetric version of rock-paper-scissors where the rewards aren't equal. Rock-paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a new player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors theory, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, the uneven payoffs here change the optimal strategy.\n\n5. With the given payoffs, rock seems risky but potentially rewarding. If I play rock, I either win big (3 points) or lose small (-1 point).\n\n6. Since this is the first move and I have no information on my opponent, I'll choose rock as it has the best risk-reward ratio - high potential gain if I win against paper, and limited loss if I lose against scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   \n   They've completely abandoned their original alternating pattern and are now playing more unpredictably.\n\n4. Their sequence of scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock might suggest they're now cycling through the three options in reverse order, which would mean paper is next.\n\n5. However, this is just one possibility, and they might be developing a more complex strategy or responding to my moves.\n\n6.

It appears I've been playing with the wrong understanding. Let me correct my understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n   - Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n   - Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\n5. So paper does beat scissors, which explains the last round's result. I need to adjust my strategy based on the correct rules.\n\n6. Given the correct rules, my opponent's pattern is harder to exploit, but I notice they've played paper most recently.\n\n7.

Rock would be my best move if they play scissors next (+3 points).\n   Rock would tie if they play rock again (0 points).\n   Rock would lose to paper (-3 points), but they just played paper so they might be less likely to repeat it.\n\n9. Given the confusion about rules and the increasingly unpredictable nature of the game, I should focus on maximizing expected value rather than trying to predict specific patterns.\n\n10. Under the correct rules, rock has the highest potential payoff against scissors (+3) and only risks losing to paper (-3).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they might switch to scissors after playing paper, giving me the chance for the highest possible gain in this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, my opponent might have realized I was exploiting patterns earlier and could be deliberately mixing up their strategy.\n\n9. Looking at my opponent's broader behavior, they've started playing more unpredictably in recent rounds after their initial pattern was broken.\n\n10. Since scissors beats rock and only loses to paper, and there's some evidence they might play rock next, scissors seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they might follow their recent cycle and play rock next.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current score is 6 - 1 = 5 points.\n\n3. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   \n   Instead of following the pattern I anticipated (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they played scissors.\n\n4. This suggests they might be deliberately trying to counter my moves rather than following a predictable pattern.\n\n5. Let me look at my recent sequence and my opponent's responses:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost)\n\n   It seems they've started playing the move that would have lost to my previous move.\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after I played rock, they'd respond to that by playing the move that would have lost to rock, which is paper.\n\n7. Against their expected paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n8. However, they might also recognize that I've caught onto this pattern and change their strategy.\n\n9. Given the evolving nature of the game and that my opponent might be employing adaptive strategies, I should consider the move with the best risk-reward profile.\n\n10. Paper has a balanced risk-reward profile:\n    - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n    - Paper loses to rock (-3 points)\n    - Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n\n11. Given my uncertainty about my opponent's next move and the fact they just played scissors (which paper beats), paper seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which counters their most recent move (scissors) and has a relatively balanced risk-reward profile in this uncertain situation.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score is 5 + 1 = 6 points.\n\n3. Wait, I need to double-check this result. I played paper against scissors and won? This contradicts the rules we've established. Let me verify the rules again:\n\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n4. Yes, paper beats scissors according to our established rules, so winning 1 point makes sense.\n\n5. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   \n   They've played scissors twice in a row now.\n\n6. Looking at the outcome sequence more carefully:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played rock, I won (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors, I lost (scissors beats rock)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played scissors, I won (paper beats scissors)\n\n7. The rules are consistently:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n8. After playing scissors twice in a row, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors a third time (less likely)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play scissors to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n9. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper (+1 point).\n   If they switch to rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n   If they switch to paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n10. Given that they've played scissors twice in a row and might expect me to counter with paper again, they're most likely to switch to rock.\n\n11. Against their expected rock, my best move would be scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to rock after playing scissors twice in a row.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent might be trying to establish a pattern to trick me, or they could be responding to my moves in some way.\n\n7. After playing rock (which I beat with scissors), they might:\n   - Play rock again (less likely)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play paper)\n\n8. If they're following a pattern similar to mine, after playing rock they might play paper next.\n\n9. Against paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n10. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play rock again (since I won with scissors), and play scissors to counter.\n\n11. Paper would beat scissors if they play scissors, but would lose to rock if they play rock.\n\n12. Rock has the highest potential payoff (+3 points against paper) and a moderate risk (-1 point against scissors).\n\n13.

After playing scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors again (they've shown a tendency to repeat scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock)\n\n9.

After we both played scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors again (to match them)\n   - Switch to paper (which beats scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (which loses to scissors)\n\n6. If they expect me to play paper, they would play rock.\n   If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors in recent rounds, paper would be my best counter if they continue this pattern (+1 point).\n\n8. However, after three consecutive scissors plays, there's an increasing probability they'll switch, likely to rock.\n\n9. Against their potential rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. This is a critical decision point. If they continue with scissors, paper wins.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "I need to think through my strategy for this rock-paper-scissors variant.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any history to analyze.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is random selection with equal probability, but this variant has asymmetric payoffs.\n\n4. The highest potential gain is from playing rock and winning (3 points), but rock loses to scissors.\n\n5. Paper is a relatively safe move: it can win 1 point against scissors or lose 3 points against rock.\n\n6. Scissors is also relatively safe: it can win 1 point against rock or lose 1 point against paper.\n\n7. Since rock has the highest reward but also high risk, and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll choose scissors as a balanced first move.\n\n8. Scissors can win against rock (1 point) and loses minimally against paper (-1 point).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors for my first move.\n\n[move] scissors\n",
        "I'll play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game strategically, thinking through my options to maximize points.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points exchanged\n\n2. This is an asymmetric payoff structure - rock beating paper has the highest reward/penalty (3 points), while the other combinations only have 1 point at stake.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make a strategic first move.\n\n4. Rock has the potential for highest gain (3 points if opponent chooses paper), but also risk of small loss (1 point if opponent chooses scissors).\n\n5.

Scissors has potential for small gain (1 point if opponent chooses rock), but risk of small loss (1 point if opponent chooses paper).\n\n7. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I'll choose rock as my opening move since it offers the highest potential gain (3 points), even though it has some risk.\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "I need to decide on a move for this rock-paper-scissors variant. Let me think through this strategically.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, let me analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. This is not a standard rock-paper-scissors game since the payoffs are asymmetric. Rock-paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I don't have prior information about my opponent's strategy, I need to consider all possibilities.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, rock seems to offer a balanced risk-reward profile:\n   - If I play rock and my opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and my opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and my opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Paper has high risk but moderate reward:\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n6. Scissors has moderate risk and low reward:\n   - If I play scissors and my opponent plays rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and my opponent plays paper, I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and my opponent plays scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given these considerations, I'll choose rock for my first move. This protects me from the highest potential loss while still giving me a chance to win.\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "I need to think about my strategy for this game, which is a version of rock-paper-scissors with uneven rewards.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an asymmetric version of rock-paper-scissors where the rewards aren't equal. Rock-paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (\u00b11 point).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a new player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors theory, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, the uneven payoffs here change the optimal strategy.\n\n5. With the given payoffs, rock seems risky but potentially rewarding. If I play rock, I either win big (3 points) or lose small (-1 point).\n\n6. Since this is the first move and I have no information on my opponent, I'll choose rock as it has the best risk-reward ratio - high potential gain if I win against paper, and limited loss if I lose against scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "I'll think step-by-step about the best move to make in this rock-paper-scissors variant.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating paper has the highest reward/penalty (3 points), while the other victories only award 1 point.\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no historical pattern to analyze.\n\n4. The asymmetric payoff structure suggests that:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward (win 3 against paper, lose 1 against scissors)\n   - Paper is high-risk, low-reward (win 1 against scissors, lose 3 against rock)\n   - Scissors is low-risk, low-reward (win 1 against rock, lose 1 against paper)\n\n5. Without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I should consider what a rational player might choose. Many players might choose rock as their first move in a traditional game.\n\n6. Given the asymmetric payoffs, scissors seems safest for a first move - I can win 1 against rock (which many players start with), and only lose 1 if the opponent plays paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I see - in this variant, the rules are different from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock beats paper (winner gets 3, loser gets -3)\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser gets -1)\n\n4. My opponent played paper in the first round, which suggests they might:\n   - Continue with paper expecting me to switch\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper\n   - Switch to rock as a complete change\n\n5. Since my rock beat their paper and earned me good points (3), they might expect me to stick with rock. If they're strategic, they might play scissors to counter my expected rock.\n\n6. If they play scissors, I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\n7. If they're overthinking, they might expect me to switch to scissors (anticipating their switch to paper), in which case they might play rock.\n\n8. Given these considerations, I think playing paper is the best move.

So the system has reported the outcome correctly, though the roles are reversed from what I expected.

Based on the outcome message, it seems the rules might be different from what I initially understood. It appears:\n   - Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n   - Paper might beat scissors\n   - Scissors might beat rock\n\n4. Alternatively, the opponent's move might have been misreported, or there was a system error in reporting the outcome.\n\n5. Given this ambiguity, I need to make a decision that accounts for both possibilities:\n   - If the rules are as originally stated, my opponent might anticipate me playing paper next (since they played paper last time).\n   - If the rules are reversed from my initial understanding, and rock truly beats paper, then my opponent might anticipate me playing rock again.\n\n6. To avoid being predictable, and considering the ambiguity in the rules interpretation, I'll play scissors this time. If the traditional rules apply, scissors beats paper.

However, if they're playing mind games and anticipate this reasoning, they might play rock to counter my expected paper.\n\n11. Given the history and psychological factors, paper seems too risky (highest potential loss). Between rock and scissors, rock has better risk-reward (potential +3/-1 vs scissors' +1/-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which gives me the best potential reward if they switch to paper as I expect, while limiting my downside if I'm wrong.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Looking at the payoff structure again:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\n\n10. Given the uncertainty, paper offers a balanced risk-reward: potential gain of +1 if they play scissors again, or potential loss of -3 if they switch to rock.\n\n11.

Given the confusion about rules and the increasingly unpredictable nature of the game, I should focus on maximizing expected value rather than trying to predict specific patterns.\n\n10. Under the correct rules, rock has the highest potential payoff against scissors (+3) and only risks losing to paper (-3).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they might switch to scissors after playing paper, giving me the chance for the highest possible gain in this round.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Rock has the best risk-reward ratio: high potential gain (+3) with limited downside (-1).\n\n7. After playing scissors and losing, I may want to avoid being too predictable by immediately switching to rock.\n\n8. My opponent just played paper. They might:\n   - Play paper again (less likely, as repeating is often avoided)\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to play paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock)\n\n9.

My opponent might be employing a more sophisticated strategy now or trying to counter my anticipated moves.\n\n6. Given my recent play pattern (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they might expect me to cycle through and play paper next.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper, they would likely play rock (+3 points for them).\n\n8. Therefore, to counter their anticipated rock move, my best play would be scissors (+1 point for me).\n\n9. However, if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to play scissors to counter their rock, they might play paper again.\n\n10. Given this uncertainty and the complex mind game developing, I'll use a different approach.\n\n11.

Given their recent tendency to play scissors multiple times and then rock, there's a higher probability they'll play rock next.\n\n8. If I expect rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n9. However, there's always uncertainty, and they might be trying to establish a new pattern or break my expectations.\n\n10. Looking at expected value, scissors has a good balance:\n    - Scissors beats rock (+1 point) if they switch to rock\n    - Scissors ties with scissors (0 points) if they play scissors again\n    - Scissors loses to paper (-1 point) if they switch to paper (least likely scenario)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, as it counters their potential rock play and has the best risk-reward profile given their recent move patterns.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Looking at the patterns, my opponent has played scissors in 6 out of 15 rounds, which is more frequent than would be expected by random chance.\n\n5. After playing scissors, they have previously followed with:\n   - scissors again (rounds 8\u219213, 13\u219215)\n   - rock (round 9\u219210)\n   - paper (round 11\u219212)\n   \n   So they've shown all three possible follow-ups after scissors.\n\n6.

Given the uncertainty, rock offers the highest potential payoff (+3) with a relatively small potential loss (-1).\n\n9. Considering they've played scissors multiple times in recent rounds, they might continue this trend, making rock a reasonable choice.\n\n10. Additionally, if they're trying to predict my next move, they might expect me to play paper since I just played scissors, leading them to play rock to counter.

Let me review the pattern of wins:\n   - When I played rock vs. paper \u2192 I won 3 points (rounds 1, 5, 7, 16)\n   - When I played scissors vs. rock \u2192 I won 1 point (rounds 4, 6)\n   - When I played paper vs. rock \u2192 I lost 3 points (rounds 2, 14)\n   - When I played rock vs. scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point (rounds 9, 12)\n   - When I played scissors vs. paper \u2192 I lost 1 point (round 11)\n\n   This consistently shows:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n\n5. My opponent's most recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   \n   They continue to be unpredictable with no clear pattern.\n\n6.

Since my rock just beat their paper, they'll likely avoid paper in the next round.\n\n8. If they play rock, my best counter is scissors (+1 point).\n   If they play scissors, my best counter is rock (+3 points).\n\n9. Given that my opponent seems to favor scissors (played in 4 of the last 7 rounds), and rock has a higher payoff against scissors, rock provides a good risk-reward balance.\n\n10. Additionally, playing the same move twice in a row (rock in this case) can be unexpected and might catch my opponent off guard.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again, anticipating they might switch to scissors (which they've frequently played) and avoiding what might be a trap if they play rock expecting me to switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at my opponent's moves over a longer period:\n   rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   \n   They've played scissors in 6 out of the last 8 rounds, showing a strong preference for this move.\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   \n   I've cycled through all three options in the last three rounds.\n\n6. After playing scissors three times in a row, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors a fourth time (possible given their apparent preference)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play paper to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (anticipating I might play rock to counter their scissors)\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors, they might play scissors again or switch to rock anticipating me to counter with paper.\n\n8. Paper beats scissors (+1 point) and is a good counter if they play scissors again.\n   Paper loses to rock (-3 points) if they switch to that.\n\n9. Rock beats paper (+3 points) if they switch to paper.\n   Rock loses to scissors (-1 point) if they continue with scissors.\n\n10. Given their strong preference for scissors, rock is risky. Paper has a better chance of success if they continue their scissors tendency.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate this and switch to rock. The safest move might be to play scissors, which:\n    - Ties with scissors (0 points) if they continue playing scissors\n    - Beats rock (+1 point) if they switch to rock\n    - Loses to paper (-1 point) if they switch to paper (least likely based on their history)\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again, which gives me the safest profile against their likely options (continuing with scissors or switching to rock).\n\n[move] scissors\n",

My opponent's most recent moves:\n   scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   \n   They've now played scissors three times in a row, showing a strong commitment to this move.\n\n4. After playing scissors three consecutive times, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors a fourth time (possible, given their recent commitment to scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I might play paper to counter their scissors)\n   - Switch to paper (less likely given their recent pattern)\n\n5. Given their strong tendency toward scissors lately, they might be attempting to establish a pattern to trick me.\n\n6. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper (+1 point).\n   If they switch to rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n   If they switch to paper, my best move would be rock (+3 points).\n\n7. Since they've played scissors three times in a row, the most likely scenario is they'll either:\n   - Continue with scissors (expecting me to switch away from scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their scissors streak)\n\n8. Between these two most likely scenarios, paper would win against scissors but lose heavily against rock (-3 points).\n\n9. Rock would tie with rock and lose to scissors (-1 point).\n\n10. Given the extended streak of scissors from my opponent, they're most likely to either continue with scissors or switch to rock anticipating my counter.\n\n11. Paper is risky due to the potential -3 points against rock. Rock would only lose -1 point against scissors and tie with rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which offers a better risk-reward ratio against their likely moves after three consecutive scissors plays.\n\n[move] rock\n",

This strong commitment to scissors is unusual and suggests they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (showing a strong preference)\n   - Finally switch to another move, likely rock (anticipating I'll play paper to counter their scissors)\n   - Use this streak of scissors to deliberately set up a trap\n\n5. After we both played scissors, they might expect me to:\n   - Play scissors again (to match them)\n   - Switch to paper (which beats scissors)\n   - Switch to rock (which loses to scissors)\n\n6. If they expect me to play paper, they would play rock.\n   If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\n7. Given their strong preference for scissors in recent rounds, paper would be my best counter if they continue this pattern (+1 point).\n\n8. However, after three consecutive scissors plays, there's an increasing probability they'll switch, likely to rock.\n\n9. Against their potential rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n\n10. This is a critical decision point. If they continue with scissors, paper wins. If they switch to rock as I expect, scissors wins.\n\n11. Given the unusual persistence with scissors for three rounds, I think they're more likely to finally switch now than to continue with a fourth scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll finally switch to rock after playing scissors three times in a row.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

This strong commitment to scissors is unusual and suggests they might be:\n   - Trying to establish a pattern to trick me\n   - Hoping I'll switch to rock (which scissors beats)\n   - Simply being stubborn or random\n\n5.

Against rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n   Against scissors again, paper would win (+1 point).\n   Against paper, rock would win (+3 points).\n\n8. If I assume they're most likely to switch to rock, scissors would be my best move.\n\n9. However, given their unusual commitment to scissors, paper is also a strong consideration as it beats scissors.\n\n10. The expected value calculation suggests paper might be slightly better given their strong scissors tendency:\n    - Paper beats scissors (+1 point) if they play scissors again\n    - Paper loses to rock (-3 points) if they switch to rock\n    - Paper ties with paper (0 points) if they switch to paper\n\n11.
