After I won three rounds in a row by predicting their moves, they've adapted their strategy.\n\nGiven this change in pattern, I need to reconsider my approach. They might be trying to counter what they think I'll play next, or they might have switched to a different pattern entirely.\n\nSince they just played rock, and considering they might expect me to play scissors (to counter their rock), they might play paper next.\n\n[move] rock\n",
        "Interesting development! My opponent has broken their previous pattern.

This suggests my opponent is adaptive rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nNow that I've lost again, they might revert to their original pattern or try something new. Given that they just played rock, they might:\n1. Play paper next (following their original pattern)\n2. Play rock again (since it just worked)\n3. Play scissors (anticipating that I'll play rock to counter their rock)\n\nI think option 3 is most likely - they'll anticipate my adjustment. So I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"
