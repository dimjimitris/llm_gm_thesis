You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Round 15: They played scissors\n\nTheir last six moves now show: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nThis confirms they've been alternating between paper and scissors for the last six rounds. This pattern is very clear now - they've been strictly alternating between these two moves. Following this pattern, they should play paper next.\n\nGiven this consistent alternating pattern and the variant rules where:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nIf they play paper next as the pattern suggests, my best move would be rock, which would give me +3 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
