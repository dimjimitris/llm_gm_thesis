    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Let me identify helpful personas and initiate a collaboration to develop the best strategy.\n\nPersonas:\n1. Game Theorist - Expert in analyzing strategic interactions and payoff matrices\n2. Pattern Analyst - Skilled at recognizing patterns in behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Strategic Advisor - Specializes in optimal decision-making\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: First, let's analyze this game's payoff structure, which is quite different from standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper vs Scissors: Paper wins (+1/-1)\n- Rock vs Paper: Rock wins (+3/-3) \n- Scissors vs Rock: Scissors wins (+1/-1)\n- Same moves: Tie (0/0)\n\nThis is an asymmetric game with different risk/reward profiles. Rock has the highest reward (3 points) when winning against paper, but scissors and paper only give 1 point when winning.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" we have no prior data on their play patterns. In standard rock-paper-scissors, with no prior information, each move should be equally likely to be chosen by a rational opponent. However, this modified payoff structure might change behavior.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we should consider the expected value of each move:\n- Rock: +3 against paper, -1 against scissors, 0 against rock\n- Paper: +1 against scissors, -3 against rock, 0 against paper\n- Scissors: +1 against rock, -1 against paper, 0 against scissors\n\nIn this first round with no prior information, the safest play considering risk/reward would be scissors. It has the potential for a +1 gain with only a -1 loss potential, compared to paper (potential -3 loss) or rock (similar payoff structure to scissors but with higher variance).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with scissors as an initial play. It has the most balanced risk profile while still offering winning potential. Also, many players instinctively choose rock as a first move in rock-paper-scissors games, which would give us an advantage.\n\nPattern Analyst: After this first move, we should pay careful attention to the opponent's choice to inform our strategy for subsequent rounds, if there are any.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's go with scissors for this first round.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the recommendation. Scissors offers a balanced risk-reward profile in this variant of the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let me collaborate with my personas to determine the best next move.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: Interesting result. We played scissors, and the opponent played paper. Based on the payoff matrix, paper beats scissors in this variant, so we lost 1 point. This gives us our first data point about the opponent's behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth considering whether the opponent is playing strategically or randomly. Since this is just the first round, we don't have enough information to determine a pattern yet. However, we can update our analysis based on what we've observed.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Since the opponent played paper in the first round, we have several possibilities:\n1. The opponent might stick with paper, thinking it was successful\n2. The opponent might switch to another move, anticipating that we'll adapt\n3. The opponent might be playing randomly without a specific strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: In traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology, players often don't repeat the same move after winning, as they expect their opponent to counter their previous move. Instead, they typically play what would have beaten their previous move. In this case, that would mean the opponent might play scissors next (what would have beaten their paper).\n\nGame Theorist: Given the modified payoff structure of this game, let's reassess our options:\n- If we play rock and opponent plays paper: We win +3 points\n- If we play rock and opponent plays scissors: We lose -1 point\n- If we play paper and opponent plays scissors: We lose -1 point\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing rock for this round. If the opponent repeats paper, we gain +3 points (high reward). If they switch to scissors (which is psychologically common after winning with paper), we only lose -1 point (minimal risk). The risk-reward ratio favors rock in this situation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock has the highest potential payoff given what we know about the opponent's first move. Since paper has the highest penalty (-3) when losing, the opponent might be hesitant to play it again, making rock even more attractive as our choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: Rock does seem optimal for this round. As we gather more data on the opponent's playing pattern in subsequent rounds, we can further refine our strategy.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with playing rock for this round. It offers a high reward potential if they repeat paper, and minimal risk if they switch to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me consult with my personas again.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: This is surprising - we played rock and the opponent played paper again. According to the game rules, rock beats paper in this variant (unlike traditional rock-paper-scissors), giving us 3 points. The opponent has now played paper twice in a row.\n\nGame Theorist: The consistent use of paper suggests either a pattern or a strategy by the opponent. They might be unaware of the reversed rules where rock beats paper, or they may have a specific pattern they're following regardless of outcomes.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's consider our options for this third round:\n1. Play rock again: If the opponent plays paper a third time, we win another 3 points\n2. Play scissors: If the opponent switches to rock (which would be logical if they're learning), scissors would beat rock for 1 point\n3. Play paper: If the opponent switches to scissors (to counter what they think would be rock again), paper would win 1 point\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent's repeated use of paper suggests either:\n- They don't understand the modified rules\n- They have a predetermined sequence of moves\n- They're being stubborn or testing if we'll adjust\n\nGame Theorist: The highest expected value move depends on our assessment of the opponent's strategy. If we believe they'll play paper again (which seems likely given the pattern), playing rock gives us the highest return at +3 points.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend playing rock again. The risk-reward analysis strongly favors rock if there's a high probability the opponent will play paper a third time. Even if they switch to scissors (to counter our rock), we only lose 1 point, while the potential gain is 3 points if they play paper again.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The observed pattern suggests paper might be played again, making rock the optimal choice. We can reassess after seeing their third move, which will give us more data on whether they're following a pattern or adjusting to outcomes.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is the rational choice given the information we have. If they continue with paper, we maximize our gain. If they finally adjust, we can respond accordingly in future rounds.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the recommendation to play rock again. The opponent has shown a pattern of playing paper, and rock gives us the highest potential reward against this pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me collaborate with my personas to analyze the opponent's pattern and determine the best move for this round.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has now played: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. This suggests they've finally adapted to our strategy. After we beat their paper with rock in round 2, they switched to scissors, which beats rock in this variant.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent seems to be learning and adjusting. They maintained paper for two rounds, but after losing significantly with it (-3 points), they switched to scissors which counters our rock play. This suggests strategic thinking rather than random play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the opponent's potential pattern:\n- Round 1: They played paper (we played scissors)\n- Round 2: They played paper again (we played rock)\n- Round 3: They switched to scissors (we played rock again)\n\nThis suggests they might be using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy with a delay, or they're starting to counter what they anticipate we'll play.\n\nPattern Analyst: Based on the sequence so far, it's likely they're trying to anticipate our move. They might expect us to continue playing rock since it worked well for us in round 2, which is why they switched to scissors. For this round, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors if they think we'll play rock again\n2. Switch to paper if they think we'll counter with paper\n3. Switch to rock if they think we'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given the payoff structure and the opponent's apparent ability to adapt, paper would be our best move for this round. If they stick with scissors (which has worked for them just now), our paper would lose 1 point. But if they switch to rock (anticipating we'll play scissors), our paper would lose 3 points. If they play paper again, we tie.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I disagree. I think scissors is our best move here. The opponent seems to be one step behind in adapting to our strategy. They started with paper twice, then moved to scissors after we played rock successfully. If they follow the same pattern of adjusting to counter our previous successful move, they might play paper again to counter what they expect to be our scissors play (to counter their scissors).\n\nPattern Analyst: That's an interesting perspective. There's also the possibility they're now fully engaged in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle thinking. If they just played scissors, they might expect us to play paper next (which beats scissors in traditional RPS), so they might play rock to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering both analyses, I believe paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. If they play rock (which is quite possible as they try to counter our anticipated scissors), we only lose 3 points. If they play scissors again, we lose just 1 point. And if they play paper, we tie.\n\nStrategic Advisor: After reconsidering, I agree that paper is too risky with the potential -3 loss. Since we have evidence the opponent is adaptive, playing scissors gives us the best chance. If they play rock (anticipating our paper), we win 1 point. If they repeat scissors, we tie. If they play paper, we lose 1 point - a balanced risk profile.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree scissors is the most balanced choice given what we know about the opponent's adaptive behavior.\n\nAI Assistant: After analyzing the opponent's pattern and considering the risk-reward profiles of each move, scissors appears to be the optimal choice for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

If this pattern continues, they would play rock for the next two rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: The pattern of playing each move twice is interesting and could be deliberate. The tie in round 4 confirms they're not simply countering our previous move but following their own strategy. Given the modified payoff structure of this game, we should prepare for them to play rock next.\n\nStrategic Advisor: If we assume they'll play rock next, our options are:\n- Paper: Loses to rock (-3 points)\n- Rock: Ties (0 points)\n- Scissors: Wins against rock (+1 point)\n\nPattern Analyst: There's strong evidence for the \"play each move twice\" pattern. Their first four moves perfectly follow this pattern, suggesting rock is highly likely to be their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Even if we're wrong and they deviate from the pattern, playing scissors is still a reasonable choice in the overall payoff structure of this game. Scissors has a balanced risk-reward profile, potentially winning 1 point against rock while only risking losing 1 point against paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The evidence for the \"doubles\" pattern is compelling. Scissors is clearly the optimal play if we believe they'll play rock next. Even if they don't play rock, scissors offers a reasonable expected value compared to the alternatives.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also the psychology of a tie to consider - after a tie, players often change their move. Since we both played scissors last round, this reinforces the likelihood they'll switch to rock rather than play scissors a third time.\n\nGame Theorist: The combination of the observed pattern and the psychological tendency to change after a tie makes scissors the clear choice for this round.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree completely. The pattern suggests my opponent will play rock next, and scissors is the optimal counter to that move in this variant of the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've now played scissors three times in a row.\n\nGame Theorist: This is interesting. Either our pattern recognition was incorrect, or the opponent has changed their strategy. The consecutive scissors play suggests either:\n1. They're being stubborn with scissors\n2. They're trying to establish a new pattern to trick us\n3. They might be responding directly to our moves in some way we haven't recognized\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze what might have motivated their third scissors play. After we both played scissors in round 4, they might have expected us to switch to paper (which traditionally beats scissors). If so, they played scissors again to counter our anticipated paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: That's plausible. We need to consider what they might expect us to do after this second tie with scissors. There are a few possibilities:\n1. They expect us to finally play paper to \"beat\" scissors (in traditional RPS)\n2. They expect us to play rock to counter their scissors\n3. They might play scissors again, thinking we wouldn't expect a fourth repetition\n\nGame Theorist: Given the modified payoff structure, if they expect us to play paper and they play scissors again, they would lose 1 point. If they expect us to play rock and they switch to paper, they would lose 3 points. If they expect us to play scissors again and they play rock, they would lose 1 point.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Considering risk minimization, rock seems like our best option for this round. If they play scissors again, we lose only 1 point. If they switch to paper, we win 3 points. If they switch to rock, we tie.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with rock. It counters the most frequent move they've played so far (scissors), and even though scissors beats rock in this variant, the penalty is minimal (-1). And if they've finally shifted to paper, we gain significantly.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation supports rock as well. If we assume equal probability of them playing each move (which is reasonable given the uncertainty about their strategy), rock has the highest expected value in this scenario.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Playing rock also gives us valuable information for future rounds - it will help us determine if they're responding to our moves in a specific way or following their own internal pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: After analyzing the opponent's unexpected third scissors play, I agree that rock is the optimal choice for this round, offering the best combination of potential reward and minimal risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let's look for patterns in this sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: One possibility is they're using a modified \"lose-shift\" strategy. They played paper twice, lost the second time, and shifted to scissors. They played scissors three times, lost the third time, and shifted back to paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Another possibility is they're trying to establish a pattern to make us predict wrongly. They did paper twice, scissors thrice, and now paper again. They might be increasing the count by one each time (2 paper \u2192 3 scissors \u2192 4 paper next?).\n\nPattern Analyst: Or they might be responding to our moves directly. Let's review our sequence compared to theirs:\n- R1: We scissors, They paper (They win)\n- R2: We rock, They paper (We win)\n- R3: We rock, They scissors (They win)\n- R4: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R5: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R6: We rock, They paper (We win)\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at this, they seem to frequently play paper against our rock, which is unusual given the payoff structure where rock beats paper. This suggests they either don't fully understand the modified rules or are following some internal logic independent of the actual payoffs.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given that they've just played paper and lost, and looking at their pattern of switching after losses, they might switch back to scissors or try rock next. If we anticipate scissors, we should play paper. If we anticipate rock, scissors would be best.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their most consistent behavior seems to be playing paper against our rock (they've done this twice now). If we play rock again, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again, giving us another 3 points.\n\nGame Theorist: That's risky but has high reward potential. An alternative approach is to play scissors, which would win against paper if they repeat it, and tie against scissors if they switch back to that.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given the observed patterns, I recommend playing rock again. The opponent has shown a tendency to play paper against our rock despite losing significantly when doing so. While it's possible they'll finally adapt, the high reward of +3 points makes this risk worthwhile.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The opponent's behavior suggests they might not be fully adapting to the modified payoff structure. Playing rock gives us the best chance at another high score.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation supports this. Even if there's only a 50% chance they play paper again, rock has the highest expected value compared to the alternatives.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our analysis of the opponent's pattern and their repeated tendency to play paper against rock despite the negative consequences, I'll play rock again for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

After losing with paper against rock, they've switched to scissors which beats rock in this variant. \n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's look at the pattern of our moves versus theirs:\n- R1: We scissors, They paper (They win)\n- R2: We rock, They paper (We win)\n- R3: We rock, They scissors (They win)\n- R4: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R5: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R6: We rock, They paper (We win)\n- R7: We rock, They scissors (They win)\n\nThere's an interesting pattern: after round 3, whenever we repeat a move, they seem to eventually find a counter to it. We played rock twice (R2-R3), and they countered with scissors. We played scissors twice (R4-R5), and they continued with scissors but then switched. We played rock twice again (R6-R7), and they countered with scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given this adaptation pattern, they might anticipate us switching away from rock after losing. They might expect us to play paper (to counter their scissors) or scissors (to break the pattern of rock).\n\nGame Theorist: If they expect us to play paper and want to counter it, they would play rock. If they expect us to play scissors and want to counter it, they would play paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Based on the opponent's demonstrated ability to adapt, playing paper seems too risky as it could lose 3 points against rock. Scissors offers a more balanced risk profile: it wins against rock (+1) and loses minimally against paper (-1).\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Also, they've just played scissors and won with it. Their pattern suggests they might stick with a winning move at least once, giving us an opportunity to counter it effectively with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation supports paper if we believe they're likely to play scissors again after winning with it. Paper beats scissors in this variant (+1 point), and even if they play rock instead, the -3 loss is offset by the higher probability of them playing scissors.\n\nStrategic Advisor: However, given their demonstrated adaptability, I'm concerned they might anticipate us playing paper to counter their scissors and switch to rock. The -3 penalty makes this a significant risk.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their complete history, they seem to have a slight preference for scissors (played 4 times) over paper (3 times) and have yet to play rock at all. This statistical imbalance suggests scissors might be their default move, which would favor us playing paper.\n\nGame Theorist: After weighing all factors, I believe paper is our best move despite the risk. The opponent's preference for scissors and tendency to stick with winning moves makes paper the highest expected value play.\n\nAI Assistant: After analyzing the opponent's adaptation patterns and move preferences, I'll play paper for this round, which counters their most frequently played move (scissors) and has the potential to win +1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

More importantly, they played scissors again after we correctly predicted and countered it with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: This is notable! In this variant, paper beats scissors, yet they played scissors again after losing to our paper. This suggests either:\n1. They don't fully understand the modified rules\n2. They're following a predetermined pattern regardless of outcomes\n3.

It breaks the adaptation pattern we thought we were seeing.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking closer at their complete sequence, they might be following a pattern like: 2 paper, 3 scissors, 1 paper, 2+ scissors. If this pattern continues, they might still be in a \"scissors phase.\"\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've now lost with scissors against our paper but played scissors anyway, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again. If we play paper again, we have a good chance of winning another +1 point.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. The opponent has shown a strong preference for scissors (5 times now) and seems willing to play it even after losing with it. Paper is clearly our best move again.\n\nPattern Analyst: Another interesting observation is that they've still never played rock throughout all 8 rounds. This makes paper an even safer choice, as we eliminate the -3 point risk that would come from playing against rock.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation strongly supports paper for this round. With the opponent's demonstrated scissors preference and apparent reluctance to play rock, paper has the highest expected value by far.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Paper is definitely the optimal play here. The opponent's behavior suggests they either don't fully understand the payoff structure or are following some internal pattern that heavily favors scissors.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our analysis of the opponent's continued preference for scissors even after losing with it, and their complete avoidance of rock so far, I'll play paper again for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

After five consecutive scissors plays (losing the last four), they've finally adapted and switched to rock, which beats our paper for a significant 3-point gain.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical turning point. The opponent has demonstrated they can and will adapt their strategy when a pattern becomes too predictable. After we exploited their scissors play five times in a row, they countered perfectly with rock.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our complete interaction history:\n- R1: We scissors, They paper (They win)\n- R2: We rock, They paper (We win)\n- R3: We rock, They scissors (They win)\n- R4: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R5: We scissors, They scissors (Tie)\n- R6: We rock, They paper (We win)\n- R7: We rock, They scissors (They win)\n- R8: We paper, They scissors (We win)\n- R9: We paper, They scissors (We win)\n- R10: We paper, They scissors (We win)\n- R11: We paper, They scissors (We win)\n- R12: We paper, They rock (They win)\n\nThe opponent's sudden switch to rock after we played paper five consecutive times suggests they were aware of the pattern all along and chose the perfect moment to exploit our predictability.\n\nPattern Analyst: This dramatic shift suggests the opponent may have been intentionally establishing a pattern to lure us into a false sense of security before switching. Now that they've successfully countered with rock, we need to anticipate their next move carefully.\n\nGame Theorist: The question is whether they'll continue with rock (since it just won them 3 points) or switch again anticipating that we'll change our strategy. There are three main possibilities:\n1. They play rock again, expecting us to continue with paper or switch to scissors\n2. They switch back to scissors, anticipating we'll play rock to counter their rock\n3. They play paper, anticipating we'll play scissors to counter their rock\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given their demonstrated ability to adapt after a long period of apparent inflexibility, I believe they'll anticipate we'll counter their rock with scissors. If so, they might play paper to counter our anticipated scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, their overall pattern has shown a strong preference for scissors throughout the game (8 out of 12 moves). They might revert to their preferred move, especially if their rock play was just a one-time adaptation.\n\nGame Theorist: They've also shown they can be stubborn with a winning move (playing scissors multiple times after winning with it initially). They might stick with rock after just winning 3 points with it.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Considering all factors, I recommend playing scissors for this round. It counters rock if they play it again, and while it loses to paper, the loss is only -1 point compared to the -3 we'd lose if we played paper against rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors offers the best risk-reward ratio in this uncertain situation. If they play rock again (which seems reasonably likely given their tendency to repeat winning moves), we win 1 point. If they play paper, we lose only 1 point. If they revert to scissors, we tie.\n\nPattern Analyst: Scissors makes the most sense given what we know about their behavior patterns. It's a balanced play that accounts for their demonstrated ability to suddenly adapt while still considering their overall move preferences.\n\nAI Assistant: After analyzing the opponent's sudden and strategic change to rock, scissors appears to be the optimal choice for this round - countering their rock if they repeat it while minimizing potential losses if they adapt again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

It worked against their rock last time, and there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior throughout the game suggests they don't quickly adapt after losing a single round with a move. They played scissors five times consecutively despite losing with it repeatedly. Following that pattern, they may well play rock again despite just losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation supports scissors as our best move. Given their demonstrated pattern of move streaks and slow adaptation, scissors has the highest expected value against their likely rock play, with minimal downside if they switch.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree that scissors is optimal. It counters their most recent move (rock), which they've shown a tendency to repeat regardless of outcomes.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the opponent's established pattern of playing moves in streaks regardless of outcomes, I'll play scissors again this round to counter their likely rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They played scissors five times consecutively before switching, so they may well continue with rock for several more rounds despite losing with it.\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with rock for a fourth round, scissors would win us another 1 point. If they suddenly switch to paper, scissors would lose 1 point. If they switch to scissors, we would tie. Given their demonstrated pattern of extended move streaks, rock is by far their most likely play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given their extremely consistent behavior of playing moves in extended streaks regardless of outcomes, scissors remains our optimal play. It has worked against their rock for two consecutive rounds, and there's a high probability they'll play rock again.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their behavior throughout the game suggests they follow a predetermined pattern rather than adapting to outcomes. Based on this pattern recognition, I estimate an 80%+ chance they play rock again, making scissors clearly our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation overwhelmingly supports scissors as our best move. Given their demonstrated pattern of extended move streaks and very slow adaptation, scissors has the highest expected value against their highly probable rock play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree completely. Scissors is optimal given what we know about their behavior pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the opponent's remarkably consistent pattern of playing moves in extended sequences regardless of outcomes, I'll play scissors again this round to counter their highly probable rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

In previous sequences, they played each move at least twice before switching (paper twice initially, scissors at least five times, rock four times).\n\nGame Theorist: If they continue with paper, our best counter is rock, which would win us 3 points.

Based on this pattern recognition, I estimate a 95% chance they play scissors again, making paper clearly our best move.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation strongly supports paper as our best move. Given their demonstrated pattern of extended move streaks, paper has the highest expected value against their highly probable scissors play.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree completely. Paper is optimal given what we know about their extraordinarily consistent behavior pattern of playing each move multiple times before switching.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the opponent's remarkably consistent pattern of playing each move in extended sequences before switching, I'll play paper this round to counter their highly probable scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"
