Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating Paper gives the highest reward (+3) and Paper losing to Rock has the highest penalty (-3).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I need a reasonable opening strategy.\n\n4. If I play Rock: I win big (+3) if opponent plays Paper, lose small (-1) if opponent plays Scissors, tie if opponent plays Rock.\n\n5. If I play Paper: I win small (+1) if opponent plays Scissors, lose big (-3) if opponent plays Rock, tie if opponent plays Paper.\n\n6. If I play Scissors: I win small (+1) if opponent plays Rock, lose small (-1) if opponent plays Paper, tie if opponent plays Scissors.\n\n7.

This could indicate:\n   - They might also have analyzed the payoff structure and recognized Rock as a strong opening\n   - They might tend to start with Rock as a standard opening move\n   - They might continue with Rock, expecting me to change my move\n\n3. Given this tie with Rock, my opponent may expect me to switch to Paper (to beat their Rock). However, if I switch to Paper and they anticipate this by switching to Scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n\n4.

Let's recap what's happened so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Rock, they played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, they played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n\n2. My opponent appears to be adapting their strategy based on previous rounds. They've gone from Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper.\n\n3. There seems to be a pattern in their play: they started with Rock, then moved to what would beat Rock (Scissors), then moved to what would beat Scissors (Paper in this variant).\n\n4. If they continue this pattern of playing what beats their previous move, they might play Rock next (since Rock beats Paper in this variant).\n\n5. If I expect them to play Rock, my best response would be Scissors, which would give me +1 points.\n\n6. However, they might also be analyzing my moves:\n   - I went from Rock (twice) to Paper\n   - They might expect me to continue changing and play Scissors next\n\n7. If they anticipate me playing Scissors and respond with Rock, playing Scissors would be bad for me.\n\n8. Given the higher risk/reward with Rock (+3/-3 with Paper), I need to be cautious about them playing Rock.\n\n9. I notice that Scissors has the most balanced risk profile in this variant:\n   - Against Rock: Win +1\n   - Against Paper: Lose -1\n   - Against Scissors: Tie 0\n\n10. Since there's evidence my opponent might play Rock next, and Scissors has a favorable outcome against Rock with a limited downside against other moves, I'll choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Let's update our game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Rock, they played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, they played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, they played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n\n2. It seems my opponent might be mirroring my moves with a one-round delay:\n   - I played Rock in round 1, they played Rock in round 1\n   - I played Rock in round 2, they played Scissors in round 2\n   - I played Paper in round 3, they played Paper in round 3\n   - I played Scissors in round 4, they played Scissors in round 4\n\n3. If this pattern holds, they might play whatever I just played (Scissors) in the next round.\n\n4. If I expect them to play Scissors next, my best response would be Rock, which would give me +1 points.\n\n5. However, they might have noticed this pattern too and could be trying to anticipate my next move.\n\n6. Let me consider the payoff structure again:\n   - Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins (+1/-1)\n   - Rock vs. Paper: Rock loses (-3/+3)\n   - Paper vs. Scissors: Paper wins (+1/-1)\n\n7. If I play Rock and they play Scissors, I win +1.\n   If I play Rock and they play Paper, I lose -3.\n   If I play Rock and they play Rock, we tie 0.\n\n8. Given our history of three ties out of four rounds, there's a chance my opponent is actively trying to predict my moves to either tie or win.\n\n9. Since I believe they might play Scissors next (following the mirroring pattern), and Rock beats Scissors, I'll choose Rock.\n\n10. Additionally, if they break the mirror pattern and try to anticipate my Rock by playing Paper, they'd win. But if they think I might anticipate this and play Scissors instead, my Rock would win against their Scissors. This suggests Rock is still a reasonable choice despite the risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Rock, they played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, they played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, they played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, they played Paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n\n2. My current score: 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 3 - 3 = -2 points\n\n3. My opponent's moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   My moves: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n4. Looking at their last few moves, I see they've broken their Paper streak and switched to Rock. This seems to align with my hypothesis that they would change strategy.\n\n5. Looking at a pattern in our recent exchanges:\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, they played Paper \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost\n\n6. I notice they played Paper when I played Rock (twice), and Rock when I played Paper (twice).\n\n7. If this pattern holds, they might play Scissors if I play Scissors, or continue with their counter strategy.\n\n8. Given the recent exchanges, they seem to be attempting to counter what I played previously, rather than predicting my next move.\n\n9. If they're using this strategy, they might expect me to play Scissors next (since I went Rock \u2192 Paper in rounds 8-9) and prepare to counter with Rock.\n\n10. If they play Rock expecting my Scissors, I should play Paper to counter their Rock.\n\n11. However, given that this exact sequence just lost me 3 points, they might anticipate I won't repeat it.\n\n12. I need to break this cycle. Since they seem to be countering my last move rather than predicting my next one, I'll play Rock, which would win against their potential Paper (if they're countering my Paper from last round) and tie against their potential Rock (if they're predicting I'll play Scissors).\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Rock, they played Rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, they played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, they played Scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, they played Paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, they played Paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, they played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, they played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. My current score: 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 3 - 3 - 1 = -3 points\n\n3. My opponent's moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   My moves: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n4. Looking at their last few moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   This doesn't show a clear pattern, suggesting they might be adapting their strategy based on our game history rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n5. Their most recent move was Scissors, which in this variant loses to Paper (+1/-1) and beats Rock (+1/-1).\n\n6. If I look at the entire history, they've played:\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n   This is fairly balanced, with a slight preference for Paper.\n\n7. Looking at the last few rounds where I've consistently lost, I need to break out of this losing streak.\n\n8. If they're adapting to counter my moves, they might expect me to play Paper (to counter their Scissors). In that case, they might play Rock.\n\n9. If they play Rock expecting my Paper, I should play Scissors to win +1 point.\n\n10. However, they've just played Scissors, so they might play Rock or Paper next to vary their strategy.\n\n11. If I play Scissors:\n    - Against Rock: I win +1\n    - Against Paper: I lose -1\n    - Against Scissors: Tie 0\n\n12. Given the balanced risk profile of Scissors in this variant and the potential to counter a Rock play (which seems reasonable after their Scissors play), I'll choose Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My current score: 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 1 = -2 points\n\n3. My opponent's moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   My moves: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n4. Their last three moves were: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   This could suggest they're returning to Rock after trying Scissors, or possibly starting a new pattern.\n\n5. Looking at our last exchange, I played Scissors and they played Rock, which normally would be bad for me, but in this variant Scissors beats Rock, so I won.\n\n6. If they're analyzing the game rules properly, they'll realize that their Rock lost to my Scissors. They might adjust by playing Paper (which beats Scissors in this variant).\n\n7. If they play Paper expecting my Scissors again, I should play Rock to counter, winning +3 points.\n\n8. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to Rock after my success with Scissors, and play Scissors themselves to counter.\n\n9. If I play Rock:\n   - Against Rock: Tie 0\n   - Against Paper: Win +3\n   - Against Scissors: Lose -1\n\n10. If I play Scissors again:\n    - Against Rock: Win +1\n    - Against Paper: Lose -1\n    - Against Scissors: Tie 0\n\n11. Looking at the potential outcomes, Rock has a better potential reward (+3) with a similar risk (-1) compared to Scissors. Additionally, they've played Rock most recently, so they might switch to Paper to counter my expected Scissors play.\n\n12. I'll play Rock this round, betting that they'll switch to Paper to counter my previous successful Scissors move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their last four moves were: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   There appears to be an alternating pattern between Rock and Scissors in their recent moves.\n\n5. If this pattern continues, they might play Rock next.\n\n6. Let me also look at our exchanges when I played each move:\n   - When I played Rock: They played Rock (tie), Scissors (I lost), Paper (I won), Paper (I won), Scissors (I lost), Scissors (I lost)\n   - When I played Paper: They played Paper (tie), Rock (I lost), Rock (I lost)\n   - When I played Scissors: They played Scissors (tie), Paper (I lost), Rock (I won)\n\n7. My best outcomes have been when I played Rock against their Paper, and Scissors against their Rock.\n\n8. If I expect them to play Rock next (following their apparent alternating pattern), I should play Scissors to win +1 point.\n\n9. However, they might also be analyzing my moves and could anticipate this. If they break their pattern and play Paper instead, my Scissors would lose (-1 point).\n\n10. Given that they've played Scissors in their last move, and there's a potential alternating pattern suggesting Rock next, I'll play Scissors to try and capitalize on this pattern.\n\n11. This also introduces some variety into my play, making my strategy less predictable.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their last five moves now show an even clearer alternating pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   This strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next.\n\n5. If they play Scissors as predicted, my best response would be Paper (which beats Scissors in this variant), giving me +1 points.\n\n6. However, they might have noticed that I've caught onto their pattern and might break it deliberately. If they play Rock or Paper instead, how would my Paper fare?\n   - Against Rock: Lose -3\n   - Against Paper: Tie 0\n\n7. The risk with Paper is significant (-3) if they play Rock instead of following the pattern.\n\n8. Let me also consider my recent success with Scissors against their Rock. They might expect me to play Scissors again and counter with Paper.\n\n9. If I play Scissors again:\n   - Against Scissors (following pattern): Tie 0\n   - Against Rock (breaking pattern): Win +1\n   - Against Paper (countering my Scissors): Lose -1\n\n10. Given my recent success with Scissors and the lower risk profile compared to Paper, I might be tempted to play Scissors again.\n\n11. However, sticking too long with one move makes me predictable. Their expected Scissors (following pattern) would be countered best by Paper.\n\n12. I'll play Paper this round, betting on their alternating pattern continuing with Scissors. Even if they break the pattern, Paper only loses badly to Rock, and would tie against Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If they break the pattern to try to catch me off guard:\n   - If they play Paper, my Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n   - If they play Scissors again, my Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8.

Their previous pattern was Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, but they broke it by playing Paper instead of the expected Rock.\n\n5. This suggests they realized I had caught onto their pattern and deliberately changed tactics.\n\n6. Looking at their overall moves:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n   They've now played each move equally, which might indicate a more balanced approach.\n\n7. Their last two moves were Scissors \u2192 Paper. If they're starting a new pattern, they might play Rock next (cycling through Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock).\n\n8. Alternatively, they might be countering what they think I'll play next. Since I just lost with Scissors against their Paper, they might expect me to switch to Rock (to beat their Paper).\n\n9. If they expect me to play Rock and want to counter it, they would play Paper (which in this variant loses to Rock, giving me +3).\n\n10. If they play Rock as part of a new cycling pattern, my Paper would lose (-3 points).\n\n11. If they play Scissors anticipating my Paper, my Rock would lose (-1 point).\n\n12. Given that they just broke a long-established pattern, I should be cautious. If they've shifted to actively countering my moves, then they might expect me to play Rock next (to counter their Paper).\n\n13. I'll play Rock this round, betting that they'll either play Paper again (expecting me to play Rock) or Scissors (as part of a new cycling pattern). Against Paper I would win significantly (+3), and against Scissors I would only lose minimally (-1).\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My current score: 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 3 - 3 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 = -3 points\n\n3.

Their last three moves were Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, which doesn't show a clear pattern.\n\n5. Looking at our overall game history, they seem to be adapting their strategy frequently, making it difficult to predict their next move with high confidence.\n\n6. Let me look at what happened when I played each move recently:\n   - When I played Rock in round 16: They played Scissors (I lost)\n   - When I played Scissors in round 15: They played Paper (I lost)\n   - When I played Paper in round 14: They played Scissors (I won)\n   - When I played Scissors in round 13: They played Rock (I won)\n\n7. I've been switching my moves frequently, and they seem to be countering effectively. I need to be less predictable or find a better pattern in their play.\n\n8. Their last move was Scissors. They might anticipate that I'll switch away from Rock after losing with it, possibly to Paper.\n\n9. If they expect me to play Paper and want to counter it, they would play Rock.\n\n10. However, they might also continue with Scissors, thinking I might play Paper to counter their expected Rock.\n\n11. If I play Paper:\n    - Against Rock: Lose -3\n    - Against Paper: Tie 0\n    - Against Scissors: Win +1\n\n12. If I play Scissors:\n    - Against Rock: Win +1\n    - Against Paper: Lose -1\n    - Against Scissors: Tie 0\n\n13. Since they've played Scissors twice in their last three moves, and given the overall pattern of their play, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll play Rock or Paper next.\n\n14. I'll play Scissors this round, which would win against Rock (+1) and only lose minimally against Paper (-1). This also introduces variability in my play pattern, making me less predictable.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their last four moves were Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   There's no obvious pattern here, suggesting they might be using a more complex strategy or actively adapting to counter my moves.\n\n5. Looking at our recent exchanges:\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, they played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I won)\n\n6. I just won with Scissors against their Rock, which in this variant gives me +1 point. Given that I've just succeeded with Scissors, they might anticipate I'll play Scissors again and counter with Paper.\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to Paper (to counter their expected Rock) and respond with Scissors.\n\n8. If I play Paper:\n   - Against Rock: Lose -3\n   - Against Paper: Tie 0\n   - Against Scissors: Win +1\n\n9. If I play Rock:\n   - Against Rock: Tie 0\n   - Against Paper: Win +3\n   - Against Scissors: Lose -1\n\n10.

Given that I've just won with Scissors and they might expect me to repeat this move, I'll switch to Rock, which would win significantly against their potential Paper counter (+3) and only lose minimally to Scissors (-1) if they anticipate this switch.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their last five moves were Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   I'm not seeing a consistent pattern in their recent plays.\n\n5. Looking at how they've responded to my Rock plays:\n   - Round 1: I played Rock, they played Rock (Tie)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, they played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, they played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played Rock, they played Scissors (I lost)\n\n6. I notice they've played Scissors against my Rock in the last 5 consecutive Rock plays. This suggests they've identified a pattern in when I play Rock and are consistently countering it with Scissors.\n\n7. Looking at my Scissors plays:\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, they played Scissors (Tie)\n   - Round 7: I played Scissors, they played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, they played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I won)\n\n8. My Scissors plays have been more successful recently, winning 3 out of the last 4 times.\n\n9. Looking at my Paper plays:\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper (Tie)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, they played Scissors (I won)\n\n10. Paper has been my least successful move overall.\n\n11. Given that they've consistently countered my Rock with Scissors recently, I should avoid Rock this round.\n\n12. Since I've had more success with Scissors, and they've just played Scissors, I'll play Paper this round. They might anticipate that I'll play Scissors again (since I've alternated between Scissors and Rock recently) and counter with Paper, which my Paper would tie against. If they play Rock to counter my expected Paper, we'd tie (which is better than losing). If they play Scissors again, my Paper would win (+1).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their last three moves were Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   There's no clear pattern, but they've alternated between Rock and Scissors in their last few moves.\n\n5. Looking at how they've responded to my Paper plays:\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, they played Paper (Tie)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 14: I played Paper, they played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played Paper, they played Rock (I lost)\n\n6. They've countered my Paper with Rock in 3 out of 5 cases, which in this variant gives them a significant advantage.\n\n7. Looking at my recent Scissors plays:\n   - Round 15: I played Scissors, they played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 17: I played Scissors, they played Rock (I won)\n\n8. Scissors has been somewhat successful against their Rock (winning +1), but lost against Paper.\n\n9. Given their last move was Rock, and they've played Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock in their last three moves, they might play Scissors next if they follow this alternating pattern.\n\n10. If they play Scissors, my best response would be Paper (+1 points).\n\n11. However, given my poor record with Paper (losing 3 out of 5 times), I should consider alternatives.\n\n12. If I play Scissors:\n    - Against their expected Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n    - Against Rock (if they break pattern): Win (+1 points)\n    - Against Paper: Lose (-1 points)\n\n13. Scissors offers a reasonable risk-reward profile in this situation. It could win against Rock (which they've played frequently) and would only tie or lose minimally otherwise.\n\n14. I'll play Scissors this round, betting that they either continue their alternating pattern with Scissors (tie) or stick with Rock (win).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I'm on a losing streak of 3 rounds, which suggests my opponent has figured out how to counter my strategy effectively.\n\n7. Their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   This is fairly balanced, with a slight preference for Rock and Scissors.\n\n8. Their last move was Paper. In the past, when they played Paper:\n   - Round 3: After Paper, they played Scissors\n   - Round 5: After Paper, they played Rock\n   - Round 7: After Paper, they played Paper\n   - Round 8: After Paper, they played Rock\n   - Round 15: After Paper, they played Scissors\n\n9. There's no clear pattern in what they play after Paper, but they've gone to Rock and Scissors with roughly equal frequency.\n\n10. Given the unpredictable nature of their strategy and my recent losses with all three moves, I need to try something different.\n\n11. If I consider the payoff structure:\n    - Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against Paper, but has lost frequently for me recently\n    - Paper has been my least successful move overall\n    - Scissors has had mixed results\n\n12. Since their last move was Paper, and they haven't played the same move twice in a row recently, they'll likely play either Rock or Scissors next.\n\n13. If they play Rock, my Paper would lose badly (-3).\n    If they play Scissors, my Rock would lose (-1).\n    If they play Paper again, my Rock would win significantly (+3).\n\n14. Given these considerations and the need to break my losing streak, I'll play Rock, which has the highest potential reward if they play Paper again and a moderate risk otherwise.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their last five moves were Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   I don't see a clear pattern, but they've played Rock in 2 of their last 3 moves.\n\n5. After Rock, their historical plays have been:\n   - Round 1: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 6: After Rock, they played Paper\n   - Round 9: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 11: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 13: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 17: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 19: After Rock, they played Paper\n\n6. They've tended to play Scissors after Rock (5 out of 7 times).\n\n7. If they follow this pattern, they might play Scissors after their recent Rock.\n\n8. If they play Scissors, my best response would be Paper (+1 point).\n\n9. However, my Paper plays have often been countered by Rock, resulting in significant losses (-3 points).\n\n10. If I play Paper:\n    - Against Scissors (expected): Win (+1)\n    - Against Rock: Lose badly (-3)\n    - Against Paper: Tie (0)\n\n11. If I play Scissors:\n    - Against Scissors: Tie (0)\n    - Against Rock: Win (+1)\n    - Against Paper: Lose (-1)\n\n12. If I play Rock:\n    - Against Scissors: Lose (-1)\n    - Against Rock: Tie (0)\n    - Against Paper: Win (+3)\n\n13. Given their tendency to play Scissors after Rock, but considering my poor history with Paper plays, Scissors seems to offer a balanced risk-reward profile. It would win against Rock and only lose minimally to Paper.\n\n14. I'll play Scissors this round, expecting that they might play Rock or Scissors, both of which would give me either a win or a tie.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They've played Paper 3 times and Rock 4 times after Scissors. This suggests they might slightly favor Rock after Scissors.\n\n7. If they play Rock next, my best response would be Scissors, which would win +1 point in this variant.\n\n8. If they play Paper next, my best response would be Rock, which would win +3 points.\n\n9.

Their last move was Rock. After Rock, their historical plays have been:\n   - Round 1: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 6: After Rock, they played Paper\n   - Round 9: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 11: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 13: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 17: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 19: After Rock, they played Paper\n   - Round 21: After Rock, they played Scissors\n   - Round 23: After Rock, what will they play?\n\n5. They've played Scissors 6 times and Paper 2 times after Rock. This strongly suggests they favor Scissors after Rock.\n\n6. If they play Scissors next as the pattern suggests, my best response would be Paper, which would win +1 point.\n\n7. I've played Scissors in the last two rounds (tie and win), which might make my strategy predictable. They might expect me to play Scissors again and counter with Paper.\n\n8.

Scissors has been my most successful move recently, but playing it for a third time in a row might be too predictable.\n\n10. Given their strong tendency to play Scissors after Rock, I'll play Paper this round, expecting to win +1 point if they follow their historical pattern.\n\n11. This is a change from my recent Scissors plays and might catch them off guard, especially if they're anticipating me to continue with Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
