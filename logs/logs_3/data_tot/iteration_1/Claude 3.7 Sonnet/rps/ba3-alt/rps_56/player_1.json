Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to think about my strategy for this game of rock, paper, scissors with modified point values.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an unusual payoff structure. Rock beating paper has the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning scenarios only award 1 point.\n\n3. Given these payoffs, rock seems to be the strongest move:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock, we tie with 0 points\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, they don't know my strategy yet, and I don't know theirs.\n\n5. In standard rock-paper-scissors, paper is often a common first move choice for many players. If my opponent follows this pattern, playing rock would be disadvantageous.\n\n6. Given the higher stakes for rock vs paper interactions, I'll avoid playing rock initially.\n\n7. Between scissors and paper, scissors has a slight advantage in the modified game since it can win against rock for 1 point.\n\n8. For the first move, I'll choose scissors as it protects against a rock opening while potentially beating a paper opening.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent chose rock in the first round. They might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n\n4.

This suggests my opponent might be:\n   - Confused about the modified rules (thinking they're playing standard rock-paper-scissors)\n   - Following a pattern where they play what would normally beat my previous move\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, since I just played paper, they would play rock (which would normally beat paper).\n\n5. If they play rock, my best move would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n\n6.

The pattern has changed. This time, my opponent did not play what would normally counter my previous move.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent has played:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Paper\n   - Round 3: Scissors\n   - Round 4: Paper\n\n4. It seems they might be following a simple pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n   Based on this pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n5. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper (winning 1 point).\n\n6. However, they might also have noticed I won the first three rounds and deliberately changed strategy in Round 4, which worked for them.\n\n7. Another possibility is that they've finally realized the rules are modified and are adapting accordingly.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty, I need to choose a move that has the best expected value across multiple opponent strategies:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the pattern I identified), paper wins me 1 point\n   - If they play rock (adapting to try something new), paper loses me 3 points\n   - If they repeat paper (since it just worked for them), paper ties for 0 points\n\n9.

Given that paper seemed to work for them last round, there's a decent chance they might play it again. I'll play rock to counter that possibility.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they're trying to establish a psychological advantage, they might expect me to play rock to counter their potential scissors, and then they would play paper.\n\n8.

After playing paper, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Paper \u2192 Scissors twice before)\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Paper \u2192 Rock once before)\n   - Play paper again (they've done Paper \u2192 Paper once before)\n\n8. The most common follow-up to paper in their pattern has been scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n   If they play rock, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n\n10. Given that they've played paper most frequently overall, and they might be less likely to play it again immediately after just losing with it, I'll prepare for either scissors or rock.\n\n11. Between paper (to counter scissors) and scissors (to counter rock), paper has the better worst-case scenario:\n    - Paper: Win 1 point vs scissors, lose 3 points vs rock, tie vs paper\n    - Scissors: Win 1 point vs rock, lose 1 point vs paper, tie vs scissors\n\n12. However, they've shown a pattern of playing scissors after paper twice before, which makes paper a risky choice now.\n\n13. I'll play scissors this round, anticipating they might switch to rock after their paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Interestingly, we've now tied with scissors twice, and they've played scissors in 4 out of 10 rounds, making it their most common move, followed by paper (4/10) and rock (2/10).\n\n4. After playing scissors, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Scissors \u2192 Rock once)\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Scissors \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Play scissors again (they haven't repeated scissors consecutively yet)\n\n5. Since we've tied with scissors twice now, they might be more inclined to switch to something else, expecting me to also switch.\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after scissors plays:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 3-4)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 6-7)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 8-9)\n\n7. They seem to alternate between paper and rock after playing scissors, with paper being more common.\n\n8. If they play paper, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n   If they play rock, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play scissors again, any move would result in a tie.\n\n9. Given that they've played paper twice after scissors previously, and they haven't yet played scissors three times in a row, rock seems like the best strategic choice.\n\n10. Playing rock gives me the highest potential gain (3 points against paper) and a moderate risk (losing 1 point against scissors).\n\n11. I'll play rock this round, anticipating they might switch to paper after our scissors tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they expect me to play paper:\n   - They could play scissors to counter it (winning 1 point)\n   - Or they could play rock to capitalize on the modified rules (winning 3 points)\n\n9. If they play scissors, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n   If they play rock again, any move would result in a tie.\n\n10.

Scissors has become their most common move (5/12 rounds).\n\n6. They just played scissors after playing rock. This pattern (Rock \u2192 Scissors) has occurred twice now in their sequence.\n\n7. After playing scissors, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Scissors \u2192 Rock twice)\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Scissors \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Play scissors again (they've done Scissors \u2192 Scissors once)\n\n8. Looking at their most recent moves (Rock \u2192 Scissors), they may be settling into a pattern or strategy.\n\n9. If they play rock next, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n   If they play scissors again, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n\n10. Given that they've followed scissors with both rock and paper equally in the past, and they haven't yet played scissors three times in a row, I need a balanced approach.\n\n11. Between the three options:\n    - Paper beats scissors (winning 1 point), loses to rock (losing 3 points)\n    - Rock beats paper (winning 3 points), loses to scissors (losing 1 point)\n    - Scissors beats rock (winning 1 point), loses to paper (losing 1 point)\n\n12.

Since they've transitioned from Paper \u2192 Scissors twice before (more than any other transition after paper), scissors might be their most likely next move.\n\n11. To counter scissors, I should play paper. However, this would leave me vulnerable to rock (losing 3 points).\n\n12. Given the recent ties and the opponent's balanced use of paper and scissors, I'll play rock this round:\n    - It beats paper if they repeat it (winning 3 points)\n    - It only loses 1 point to scissors (their other common move)\n    - This balanced risk-reward seems appropriate given the uncertainty\n\n[move] rock\n"

They just played scissors after playing paper, which is consistent with a pattern they've shown before (Paper \u2192 Scissors has now occurred three times).\n\n6. After playing scissors, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Scissors \u2192 Rock twice)\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Scissors \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Play scissors again (they've done Scissors \u2192 Scissors once)\n\n7. Looking at their transitions after scissors:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 3-4)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 6-7)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 9-10)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 12-13)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors (Round 15-16)\n\n8. If they play rock next, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n   If they play scissors again, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n\n9. Since they've most commonly followed scissors with rock or paper (both 2/5 times), and just lost with scissors, they might be more inclined to switch.\n\n10. I've won the last two rounds by correctly predicting their moves. They might try to break this pattern by being less predictable.\n\n11. Given their historical transitions and the fact that they've only repeated scissors consecutively once, I'll play scissors this round, anticipating they might switch to rock (which they've done twice after playing scissors).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated round summaries:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. My total score is now: 1 + 3 + 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 - 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 19 points\n\n4. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n\n5. Paper and scissors are now tied as their most frequently played moves (8/22 each).\n\n6. They just played scissors after playing paper, which is consistent with their most common pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors has now occurred five times).\n\n7. I've now won eight consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves. This confirms they are following an extremely predictable pattern.\n\n8. After playing scissors, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Scissors \u2192 Rock four times)\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Scissors \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Play scissors again (they've done Scissors \u2192 Scissors once)\n\n9. Looking at their transitions after scissors:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 3-4)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 6-7)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 9-10)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 12-13)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors (Round 15-16)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 18-19)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 21-22)\n\n10. If they play rock next, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n    If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n    If they play scissors again, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n\n11. Since they've most commonly followed scissors with rock (4/7 times), and they just did Scissors \u2192 Rock in rounds 21-22, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n12. Despite my long winning streak, they appear to be stuck in a predictable pattern without adapting.\n\n13. I'll play scissors this round, anticipating they might play rock after their scissors move, which would give me 1 point if correct.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated round summaries:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. My total score is now: 1 + 3 + 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 - 3 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 20 points\n\n4. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n\n5. Paper and scissors are still tied as their most frequently played moves (8/23 each), with rock slightly less common.\n\n6. They just played rock after playing scissors, which is consistent with their most common pattern (Scissors \u2192 Rock has now occurred five times).\n\n7. I've now won nine consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves. This confirms they are following an extremely predictable cyclic pattern.\n\n8. After analyzing the entire sequence, it appears they might be following a rock-paper-scissors cycle with some variations. Let's examine if there's a clear pattern in the last several rounds:\n\n   - Round 15-23: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n   This shows a clear cyclic pattern of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 ... for the last 9 rounds.\n\n9. After playing rock, based on their historical pattern and this clear cycle, they would most likely:\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Rock \u2192 Paper five times, and it fits the cycle)\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Rock \u2192 Scissors twice)\n   - Play rock again (they haven't repeated rock consecutively yet)\n\n10. If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n    If they play scissors next, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n    If they play rock again, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n\n11. Since they've most commonly followed rock with paper (5/7 times), and it fits the clear cyclic pattern they've established in the last 9 rounds, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\n12. I'll play rock this round, anticipating they might play paper after their rock move, which would give me 3 points if correct.\n\n[move] rock\n"
