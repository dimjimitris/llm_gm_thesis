Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's review the payoffs:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: Tie, 0 points\n\n2. Analyzing the expected value of each move:\n   - Paper: Win +1 vs scissors, Lose -3 vs rock, Tie vs paper\n   - Rock: Win +3 vs paper, Lose -1 vs scissors, Tie vs rock\n   - Scissors: Win +1 vs rock, Lose -1 vs paper, Tie vs scissors\n\n3. The payoffs aren't symmetric - rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3).\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n5. In this situation, rock seems slightly advantageous because:\n   - If I win with rock (vs paper), I get +3 points\n   - If I lose with rock (vs scissors), I only lose -1 points\n   - This gives rock a better risk/reward ratio than the other options\n\n6. However, if the opponent also reasons this way, they might choose scissors to counter.\n\n7. I'll choose paper to counter the opponent's potential rock choice, as many players tend to start with rock in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the first round:\n   - I played paper\n   - My opponent played scissors\n   - I won and gained 1 point\n\n2. Wait, that doesn't match the rules. According to the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   \n3. There must be a typo in the results. The rules state paper loses to scissors (not wins). Let me double check the rule descriptions again:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n4. Actually, it's the rule description that has the typo. It should say \"scissors beats paper\" not \"paper beats scissors.\" This explains why I won with paper against scissors.\n\n5. So the correct understanding is:\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\n6. My opponent chose scissors in round 1, which suggests they might:\n   - Continue with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to rock to counter what they think will be my switch to scissors\n   - Switch to paper to mix up their strategy\n\n7. Since they played scissors last time, I'll counter with rock this time. If they stick with scissors, I'll win +3 points. If they switch to paper, I'll lose -3 points. If they switch to rock, it's a tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given the strong evidence of their copying strategy and assuming traditional rock-paper-scissors relations, scissors seems like the best choice to counter their expected paper move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I played paper, and my opponent also played paper, resulting in a tie.\n2. This breaks my winning streak of five consecutive rounds.\n3. My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Paper in rounds 15, 16, 17\n   - Scissors in round 18\n   - Rock in round 19\n   - Paper in round 20\n4. They seem to have returned to paper after briefly cycling through all options.\n5. This could indicate:\n   - They're returning to their paper-favoring strategy from rounds 15-17\n   - They recognized I was anticipating their moves and chose to match me\n   - They're attempting to be less predictable\n6. If they continue with their apparent preference for paper, rock would be my best play.\n7. However, if they anticipate I'll counter their paper tendency with rock, they might play scissors.\n8. Given their demonstrated adaptability and my recent success, they're likely trying to break my prediction pattern.\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play paper again (showing consistency): rock wins +3\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my rock): scissors ties 0\n   - If they play rock (complete change): paper wins +1\n10. Since paper has been their most frequent recent choice, and the potential reward is highest, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] (Countering opponent's potential continued paper play) rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Paper in rounds 15, 16, 17\n   - Scissors in round 18\n   - Rock in round 19\n   - Paper in round 20\n   - Rock in round 21\n3. After a period of playing paper consistently, they've become less predictable.\n4. It's possible they're returning to their earlier copying strategy, matching my previous move.\n5. If that's the case, they would play rock this round (copying my round 21 move).\n6. To counter rock, my best move would be scissors (+1 point).\n7. However, if they're anticipating this reasoning, they might play paper to counter my scissors.\n8. Let me also consider if they're forming a new pattern:\n   - They played paper, then scissors, then rock, then paper, then rock\n   - This could be an alternating pattern between paper and rock, with scissors occasionally mixed in\n9. If they're alternating, they might play paper next after their rock.\n10. Against paper, rock would be optimal (+3 points).\n11. Given the uncertainty between their potential copying strategy and other patterns, I'll choose paper:\n    - If they play rock (copying my last move): I win +1\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper): I lose -1\n    - If they play paper (new pattern): I tie 0\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent might copy my previous rock move) paper\n"

This suggests they might be trying to anticipate and counter my moves, but they're using traditional rock-paper-scissors logic while this game has reversed rules.\n7. If they continue this counter-strategy based on traditional rules, they might expect me to play rock after my scissors win and counter with paper.\n8.
