Let me analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an unusual payoff structure. Rock beating paper has the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning scenarios only award 1 point.\n\n3. Given these payoffs, rock seems to be the strongest move:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock, we tie with 0 points\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, they don't know my strategy yet, and I don't know theirs.\n\n5. In standard rock-paper-scissors, paper is often a common first move choice for many players. If my opponent follows this pattern, playing rock would be disadvantageous.\n\n6. Given the higher stakes for rock vs paper interactions, I'll avoid playing rock initially.\n\n7. Between scissors and paper, scissors has a slight advantage in the modified game since it can win against rock for 1 point.\n\n8.

Given the uncertainty, I need to choose a move that has the best expected value across multiple opponent strategies:\n   - If they play scissors (continuing the pattern I identified), paper wins me 1 point\n   - If they play rock (adapting to try something new), paper loses me 3 points\n   - If they repeat paper (since it just worked for them), paper ties for 0 points\n\n9. The risk of losing 3 points with paper is significant. Let me consider alternatives:\n   - Rock would win 3 points against paper, lose 1 point against scissors\n   - Scissors would win 1 point against rock, lose 1 point against paper\n\n10. Given that paper seemed to work for them last round, there's a decent chance they might play it again. I'll play rock to counter that possibility.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now played scissors twice, paper three times, and rock once. They seem to favor paper and scissors.\n\n4. They may have finally caught on to the modified rules and are adapting their strategy accordingly.\n\n5. They just played scissors after I played rock twice in a row.

My opponent's sequence of moves:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. They appear to be becoming less predictable, cycling through all three options without a clear pattern.\n\n4. My total score so far is: 1 + 3 + 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 - 3 = 3 points\n\n5. The opponent seems to have fully adapted to the modified rules and is now playing more strategically.\n\n6. After their rock play, they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think I'll play paper again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper to beat their expected paper\n\n7. Given the high penalty I just took (-3 points), I should be especially careful about the rock-paper matchup.\n\n8. Let's consider each possible move:\n   - If I play rock: Win 1 point vs scissors, lose 3 points vs paper, tie vs rock\n   - If I play paper: Win 1 point vs scissors, lose 3 points vs rock, tie vs paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win 1 point vs rock, lose 1 point vs paper, tie vs scissors\n\n9. Looking at this, scissors has the most balanced risk-reward profile: potential to win 1 point, worst case lose only 1 point.\n\n10. Given the opponent's recent unpredictability and the fact they just played rock (which might indicate they're less likely to play it again immediately), scissors seems the safest choice with potential upside.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We both played scissors in the last round, resulting in a tie.\n\n4. After playing scissors, my opponent might:\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I might play scissors again)\n   - Switch to paper (thinking I might switch to rock)\n   - Play scissors again (thinking I'll switch or to confuse me)\n\n5. The fact that we both chose scissors might make them think I'll switch to something else, so they might prepare for that by switching themselves.\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern, they've played:\n   - Rock: 2 times\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n   With a recent sequence of Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n7. If they're trying to establish a psychological advantage, they might expect me to play rock to counter their potential scissors, and then they would play paper.\n\n8. Given these considerations, my options are:\n   - Play rock: Wins 3 points vs paper, loses 1 point vs scissors, ties vs rock\n   - Play paper: Wins 1 point vs scissors, loses 3 points vs rock, ties vs paper\n   - Play scissors: Wins 1 point vs rock, loses 1 point vs paper, ties vs scissors\n\n9.

Considering they've just played scissors and might think I'll switch to rock to counter potential repeated scissors, paper becomes a risky play.

My total score is now: 1 + 3 + 1 - 1 + 3 - 1 - 3 + 0 + 3 = 6 points\n\n4. Interesting observation: My opponent has played paper 4 times now, and 3 of those times I've played rock and won 3 points each time.\n\n5. Paper is clearly their most played move (4/9 rounds), followed by scissors (3/9) and rock (2/9).\n\n6. They just played paper after playing scissors in the previous round. This is the second time they've made this specific transition.\n\n7. After playing paper, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Paper \u2192 Scissors twice before)\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Paper \u2192 Rock once before)\n   - Play paper again (they've done Paper \u2192 Paper once before)\n\n8. The most common follow-up to paper in their pattern has been scissors.\n\n9. If they play scissors, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n   If they play rock, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n\n10. Given that they've played paper most frequently overall, and they might be less likely to play it again immediately after just losing with it, I'll prepare for either scissors or rock.\n\n11.

However, they've shown a pattern of playing scissors after paper twice before, which makes paper a risky choice now.\n\n13.

My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n3. My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 3 times\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n4. Paper and scissors are tied as their most common moves (5/13 rounds each).\n\n5. After playing paper, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Paper \u2192 Scissors twice)\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Paper \u2192 Rock once)\n   - Play paper again (they've done Paper \u2192 Paper once)\n\n6. We've now had four ties in total, including the last one with paper-paper.\n\n7. Given the recent sequence of moves, they might try to anticipate my next move based on patterns they perceive in my play.\n\n8. After our paper-paper tie, they might expect me to:\n   - Switch to rock to counter their potential scissors\n   - Switch to scissors to counter their potential rock\n   - Stay with paper if they think I believe they'll stay with paper\n\n9. If they play scissors next, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n   If they play rock next, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper again, any move would result in a tie.\n\n10. Since they've transitioned from Paper \u2192 Scissors twice before (more than any other transition after paper), scissors might be their most likely next move.\n\n11. To counter scissors, I should play paper. However, this would leave me vulnerable to rock (losing 3 points).\n\n12. Given the recent ties and the opponent's balanced use of paper and scissors, I'll play rock this round:\n    - It beats paper if they repeat it (winning 3 points)\n    - It only loses 1 point to scissors (their other common move)\n    - This balanced risk-reward seems appropriate given the uncertainty\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 4 times\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n4. Their distribution is becoming quite balanced, with a slight preference for paper and scissors.\n\n5. We've now had five ties in total, including the last two consecutive ties (paper-paper followed by rock-rock).\n\n6. This growing number of ties suggests they might be successfully predicting my moves or we're falling into similar thinking patterns.\n\n7. After playing rock, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Rock \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Rock \u2192 Scissors twice)\n   - Play rock again (they haven't repeated rock consecutively yet)\n\n8. Given the recent rock-rock tie, they might expect me to:\n   - Switch to paper to counter their potential rock repeat\n   - Switch to scissors to counter their potential paper\n   - Stay with rock if they think I believe they'll switch to scissors\n\n9. If they play scissors next, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n   If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n   If they play rock again, any move would result in a tie.\n\n10. Since we've had so many ties recently, they might be more likely to switch to break the pattern.\n\n11. Between paper and scissors (to break the rock tie), they've historically been slightly more likely to play paper after rock.\n\n12. I'll play rock again, anticipating they might switch to paper after our rock tie, which would give me 3 points if correct.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Paper has become their most common move (6/15 rounds).\n\n6. They just played paper after playing rock, which is consistent with a pattern they've shown before (Rock \u2192 Paper has occurred three times now).\n\n7.

Given they just lost with paper against my rock, they might be less inclined to play paper again immediately.\n\n9. Looking at their transitions after paper:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors (Round 2-3)\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper (Round 4-5)\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors (Round 8-9)\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock (Round 13-14)\n\n10.

My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n\n5. Paper and scissors are now tied as their most commonly played moves (7/19 each).\n\n6. They just played scissors after playing paper, which is consistent with their most common pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors has now occurred four times).\n\n7. I've now won five consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves. This suggests their play has become very predictable, or they're stuck in a pattern they're not aware of.\n\n8. After playing scissors, based on their historical pattern, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (they've done Scissors \u2192 Rock three times)\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Scissors \u2192 Paper twice)\n   - Play scissors again (they've done Scissors \u2192 Scissors once)\n\n9. Looking at their transitions after scissors:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 3-4)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 6-7)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 9-10)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper (Round 12-13)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors (Round 15-16)\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock (Round 18-19)\n\n10. If they play rock next, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n    If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n    If they play scissors again, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n\n11. Since they've most commonly followed scissors with rock (3/6 times), and they just did Scissors \u2192 Rock in rounds 18-19, rock seems like their most likely next move.\n\n12. Given my winning streak, they might try to break their pattern, but historical evidence suggests they're likely to follow scissors with rock.\n\n13. I'll play scissors this round, anticipating they might play rock after their scissors move, which would give me 1 point if correct.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has now played:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 8 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n\n5. Paper and scissors are still tied as their most frequently played moves (8/23 each), with rock slightly less common.\n\n6.

I've now won nine consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves. This confirms they are following an extremely predictable cyclic pattern.\n\n8. After analyzing the entire sequence, it appears they might be following a rock-paper-scissors cycle with some variations. Let's examine if there's a clear pattern in the last several rounds:\n\n   - Round 15-23: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n   This shows a clear cyclic pattern of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 ... for the last 9 rounds.\n\n9. After playing rock, based on their historical pattern and this clear cycle, they would most likely:\n   - Switch to paper (they've done Rock \u2192 Paper five times, and it fits the cycle)\n   - Switch to scissors (they've done Rock \u2192 Scissors twice)\n   - Play rock again (they haven't repeated rock consecutively yet)\n\n10. If they play paper next, my best response would be rock (winning 3 points).\n    If they play scissors next, my best response would be paper (winning 1 point).\n    If they play rock again, my best response would be scissors (winning 1 point).\n\n11. Since they've most commonly followed rock with paper (5/7 times), and it fits the clear cyclic pattern they've established in the last 9 rounds, paper seems like their most likely next move.\n\n12.
