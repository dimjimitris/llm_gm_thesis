    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I'll think through this step-by-step to develop a strategy for this rock-paper-scissors variant.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, let me understand the unique payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. This is interesting - the payoff matrix is not symmetric! Rock beating paper has a higher point value than the other winning combinations.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need a reasonable opening move.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, rock seems to have the best risk-reward profile:\n   - If I win with rock (against paper), I get +3 points\n   - If I lose with rock (against scissors), I only lose -1 points\n   - If we tie (both rock), we both get 0 points\n\n5. Alternatively, I could play scissors, which has a balanced risk-reward:\n   - Win against rock: +1 point\n   - Lose against paper: -1 point\n   - Tie: 0 points\n\n6. Paper seems riskiest because:\n   - Win against scissors: +1 point\n   - Lose against rock: -3 points\n   - Tie: 0 points\n\n7. Given this is the first move with no prior information about my opponent, I'll choose rock for its favorable risk-reward profile.\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the last round, I played rock and my opponent played paper, so I won and gained 3 points. This means the opponent lost 3 points.\n\n2. Wait, there's an inconsistency with the rules as stated. According to the rules:\n   - Rock beats paper (not the other way around): Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   \n3. So either I misunderstood the rules, or there was a typo in the hint message. Let me reconsider the rules:\n   - If rock truly beats paper, then my rock beating their paper makes sense\n   - If paper is supposed to beat rock (as in standard rock-paper-scissors), then the outcome described would be incorrect\n\n4. Since I won with rock against their paper and got 3 points, I'll assume rock beats paper in this variant.\n\n5. Now for my next move:\n   - My opponent just lost 3 points, so they might avoid paper this round\n   - They might expect me to play rock again, since it worked\n   - They might choose scissors to beat my anticipated rock\n\n6. If they choose scissors, my best response would be paper.\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they stick with paper, we tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they switch to rock, I lose 3 points\n\n7. This is risky, but I think they're likely to switch to scissors to counter my previous rock. I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

But the outcome shows the opposite: I played paper against scissors and won. This suggests either:\n   - The rule descriptions are reversed (paper beats scissors should be scissors beats paper)\n   - Or the reporting of moves is somehow inverted\n\n5. Since I've won both rounds so far, I'll work with the pattern that's emerging:\n   - Round 1: My rock beat their paper (+3 points)\n   - Round 2: My paper beat their scissors (+1 point)\n\n6.
