First, I'll analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Given that I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper has moderate risk (-3 if opponent plays rock) and low reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors has low risk (-1 if opponent plays paper) and low reward (1 point)\n\n4. Since this is the first move with no prior information, I need to consider what a typical first-time player might choose. Many novice players tend to choose rock as their first move.\n\n5. If I expect the opponent might play rock, scissors would be a risky choice (I would lose 1 point), and paper would be the best response (I would gain 3 points).\n\n6. However, if the opponent anticipates this and plays scissors instead, my paper would lose.\n\n7. Given the higher stakes with rock (\u00b13 points vs \u00b11 points for other moves), I'll choose paper as my first move, aiming for that higher potential gain.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper, and my opponent played rock. I lost 3 points.\n\n2. This suggests my opponent did not follow the common tendency to play rock first. Actually, wait - I may have misunderstood the payoff structure. Let me re-verify:\n   - Rock beats paper: rock player gets 3 points, paper player loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: paper player gets 1 point, scissors player loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: scissors player gets 1 point, rock player loses 1 point\n\n3. So in the last round, I played paper and my opponent played rock. Since rock beats paper, my opponent gained 3 points and I lost 3 points. This confirms my understanding.\n\n4. Now I need to consider if my opponent has a strategy pattern. Since they played rock in the first round and won significantly, they might:\n   a) Play rock again, thinking it's a winning move\n   b) Anticipate that I'll switch to scissors to counter their rock, so they might switch to paper\n   c) Make a completely different choice to be unpredictable\n\n5. If they play rock again, scissors would be my best counter.\n   If they play paper, scissors would also be my best counter.\n   If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\n6. Given the payoff structure, scissors seems to have the best expected value against an opponent who played rock in the previous round - it wins against potential paper (gaining 1 point) and loses minimally against repeated rock (losing 1 point).\n\n7. I'll choose scissors for this round as it seems to have the best risk-reward profile against an opponent who played rock previously.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Wait, I need to carefully verify the game rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors: paper wins 1 point, scissors loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: rock wins 3 points, paper loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: scissors wins 1 point, rock loses 1 point\n\n4. So in the second round when I played scissors and my opponent played rock, I should have lost according to the typical rules. However, the result states that I won 1 point. This means in this variant, scissors beats rock (not the other way around).\n\n5. Let me revise my understanding of the payoff structure for this specific game:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\n6.

However, they might have noticed their strategy isn't working and could switch to paper (to beat my potential scissors) or scissors (to beat my potential paper).\n\n9.

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent has played rock in all three rounds so far.

Now I need to analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - They played rock for 3 rounds\n   - Then paper for 4 rounds\n   - Then scissors for 2 rounds so far\n\n6. Given their tendency to stick with a move for multiple rounds, there's a decent chance they'll continue with scissors.\n\n7. If they play scissors:\n   - Paper would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8. If they switch to rock:\n   - Scissors would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\n9. If they switch to paper:\n   - Rock would be my best counter (+3 points)\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n10. Since they've shown a pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, and scissors has only been played twice so far (compared to 3 for rock and 4 for paper), I'll continue with paper to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's pattern is becoming clearer:\n   - They played rock for 3 rounds\n   - Then paper for 4 rounds\n   - Then scissors for 3 rounds so far\n\n3. They seem to stick with each move for 3-4 rounds before switching. Given that they've now played scissors for 3 rounds, they might be approaching a switch point.\n\n4. Their previous switching pattern was:\n   - After 3 rounds of rock, they switched to paper\n   - After 4 rounds of paper, they switched to scissors\n   - Now after 3 rounds of scissors, they might switch again (likely to rock based on their cycle)\n\n5. If they continue with scissors for one more round:\n   - Paper would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n6.

Given their established pattern of switching after 3-4 rounds and having just completed 3 rounds of scissors, there's a significant chance they'll switch to rock.\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would be a poor choice (-3 points). If they stick with scissors, paper would be good (+1 point).\n\n10. Given the higher penalty for choosing paper against rock (-3) versus the smaller penalty for choosing scissors against paper (-1), I'll play scissors this round, anticipating their potential switch to rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern now shows:\n   - They played rock for 3 rounds\n   - Then paper for 4 rounds\n   - Then scissors for 4 rounds so far\n\n3. They've now played scissors for 4 rounds, which matches the length of time they played paper before switching. This strongly suggests they might switch to a new move in the next round.\n\n4. Following their pattern cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?), the most logical next move for them would be to return to rock.\n\n5. If they switch to rock as their pattern suggests:\n   - Scissors would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\n6.

My opponent's pattern has changed. They've now played:\n   - Rock for 3 rounds\n   - Paper for 4 rounds\n   - Scissors for 5 rounds and counting\n\n3. This breaks their previous pattern of switching after 3-4 rounds. It suggests either:\n   a) They're extending the duration of each move type\n   b) They've noticed I was anticipating their switch and are deliberately staying with scissors\n   c) They've abandoned their pattern-based approach\n\n4. Since they've played scissors for 5 consecutive rounds, breaking their previous pattern, I need to reassess. Either they:\n   a) Will finally switch in the next round (possibly to rock)\n   b) Will continue with scissors for even longer\n   c) Are mirroring my last move\n\n5. For the last two rounds, I've played scissors and they've played scissors, resulting in ties. This could indicate they're responding to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n6.

However, if my move influences their next move, I should play the move that, when mirrored, would be beaten by my subsequent move.\n\n6.

Instead of mirroring my rock move, they played paper.\n\n3. Looking at the most recent sequence:\n   - For rounds 11-12, they played scissors (matches what I played)\n   - For round 13, they played paper (matches what I played)\n   - For round 14, they played paper (does NOT match what I played)\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   a) Returning to their pattern-based approach\n   b) Attempting a new strategy\n   c) Playing somewhat randomly\n\n5. Let me reconsider their entire pattern:\n   - Rock for 3 rounds (rounds 1-3)\n   - Paper for 4 rounds (rounds 4-7)\n   - Scissors for 5 rounds (rounds 8-12)\n   - Paper for 2 rounds so far (rounds 13-14)\n\n6.

Since they've played paper for only 2 rounds in this new cycle, there's a good chance they'll continue with paper.\n\n8. Based on this analysis, rock remains my best choice for this round, as it:\n   - Wins against their likely paper play (+3 points)\n   - Ties if they switch to rock (0 points)\n   - Loses minimally if they surprise with scissors (-1 point)\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me reconsider their recent pattern:\n   - Round 13: They played paper\n   - Round 14: They played paper again\n   - Round 15: They switched to scissors\n\n3. They seem to be deliberately trying to counter my moves:\n   - When I played paper in round 13, they played paper (tie)\n   - When I played rock in round 14, they played paper (they lost)\n   - When I played rock again in round 15, they switched to scissors (they won)\n\n4. This suggests they might be adapting to counter my strategies. They noticed I played rock twice and countered with scissors in the second instance.\n\n5. If they believe I'll stick with rock again, they might continue with scissors.\n   If they think I'll switch to paper to counter their scissors, they might switch to rock.\n   If they think I'll anticipate this and play scissors, they might play paper.\n\n6. This has become a complex prediction game. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\n7. Given that they just won with scissors against my rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors thinking I'll play rock again\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I'll switch to paper\n   c) Switch to paper anticipating I'll switch to scissors\n\n8. The safest move with the best expected value appears to be paper:\n   - If they play scissors as they did last round, I win (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock, I lose but minimally (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper, I tie (0)\n\n9. The recent loss suggests they're adapting quickly, so I'll counter their most recent move (scissors) with paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent has now played scissors for three consecutive rounds:\n   - Round 15: Scissors (won against my rock)\n   - Round 16: Scissors (lost against my paper)\n   - Round 17: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n\n3. This suggests they might be settling into a pattern of playing scissors consistently, or they're trying to condition me to expect scissors before making a switch.\n\n4. Given their earlier tendency to play the same move for 3-5 rounds before switching, and the fact they've now played scissors for 3 rounds, they might:\n   a) Continue with scissors for another 1-2 rounds\n   b) Switch to a different move now that they've played scissors for 3 rounds\n\n5. If they continue with scissors:\n   - Paper would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n6. If they switch to rock:\n   - Scissors would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\n7. If they switch to paper:\n   - Rock would be my best counter (+3 points)\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n8. Looking at their earlier pattern cycles:\n   - Rock for 3 rounds\n   - Paper for 4 rounds\n   - Scissors for 5 rounds\n   - Then a less clear pattern\n\n   Based on this, and the fact they've now played scissors for 3 rounds in this new sequence, they might be due for a switch.\n\n9. Given the payoff structure and the possibility they might switch after 3 rounds of scissors, I'll play paper, which:\n   - Wins against scissors if they continue (+1)\n   - Loses significantly against rock if they switch (-3)\n   - Ties with paper if they make that switch (0)\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is interesting because:\n   a) They've lost with scissors twice now against my paper\n   b) Yet they continue to play scissors\n   c) This matches their earlier pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds (3-5)\n\n4. Given their past behavior patterns:\n   - They played rock for 3 rounds\n   - Paper for 4 rounds\n   - Scissors for 5 rounds in the first cycle\n   - Now scissors for 4 rounds in this new cycle\n\n5. Based on their previous pattern lengths, and the fact they've now lost twice with scissors against paper, there's an increased chance they'll finally switch, likely to rock.\n\n6. If they switch to rock:\n   - Scissors would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\n7. If they stubbornly continue with scissors:\n   - Paper would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n8.

I expected them to switch from scissors to rock after losing twice with scissors, and they did switch to rock, but scissors beats rock in this variant (not the other way around).\n\n3. Their overall pattern has been:\n   - Rock for 3 rounds (rounds 1-3)\n   - Paper for 4 rounds (rounds 4-7)\n   - Scissors for 5 rounds (rounds 8-12)\n   - Mixed moves (rounds 13-14)\n   - Scissors for 4 rounds (rounds 15-18)\n   - Rock for 1 round so far (round 19)\n\n4. After playing scissors for 4 rounds and losing twice to my paper, they switched to rock, which lost against my scissors.\n\n5. Given they just lost with rock, they might:\n   a) Continue with rock for another round or two (following their pattern of sticking with moves)\n   b) Switch to paper to counter my scissors\n   c) Switch back to scissors\n\n6. If they continue with rock:\n   - Scissors would be my best counter (+1 point)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n\n7.

Based on their historical pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, and the fact they just switched to rock, there's a good chance they'll play rock again despite losing.\n\n10. However, they might also be more adaptive now and switch to paper to counter my scissors.\n\n11.

Given they've now played paper for 4 rounds and lost the last two rounds with it, there's a very strong chance they'll finally switch.
