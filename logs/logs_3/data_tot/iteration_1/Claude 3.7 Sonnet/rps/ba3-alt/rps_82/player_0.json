Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock beating paper has the highest payoff (3 points)\n   - The other winning combinations only give 1 point\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history:\n   - They might choose rock as it's a common first move\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get 1 point\n   - If they choose scissors and I choose paper, I lose 1 point\n   - If they choose paper and I choose paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n4. Considering the highest potential payoff:\n   - If I choose scissors and they choose paper, I get 3 points\n   - This has the highest potential reward\n\n5.

Analyzing opponent's complete sequence:\n   - They've played: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Their most recent moves show: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their early rock-paper-scissors pattern\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Looking at their full sequence, they seem to be following a rough pattern with occasional repetitions\n   - If they continue the apparent emerging pattern, they might play scissors next\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors next, my rock would win with highest payoff (3 points)\n   - If they play rock, rock would tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper again, rock would lose (-3 points)\n\n5. Analyzing their tendencies:\n   - They've played paper 4 times, rock 4 times, and scissors 2 times\n   - They don't often repeat the same move consecutively (only with scissors once)\n   - After paper, they've played rock twice and scissors once\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock would win against scissors with highest payoff\n   - Paper would win against rock but might lose to scissors\n   - The opponent seems due for scissors based on their pattern\n\n7. Making my decision:\n   - Based on pattern analysis and potential payoffs\n   - Rock offers the best potential reward if they play scissors as predicted\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete review of all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost 3 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock, tied (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\n\n2. Clarifying the rules again:\n   - Round 18 result suggests paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - This contradicts my previous understanding that scissors should beat paper\n   - I need to reexamine all outcomes for consistency\n\n3. Reviewing key result patterns:\n   - Round 6, 10, 12, 13, 18: scissors vs paper = I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 14: rock vs paper = I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 7: paper vs rock = I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 15: rock vs scissors = I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 1: scissors vs rock = I won (+1 point)\n\n4. The consistent rule set appears to be:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - This is completely reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors, with asymmetric scoring\n\n5. Analyzing opponent's pattern:\n   - They've now played: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They've returned to paper after rock, consistent with their most common pattern\n\n6. Strategic considerations based on confirmed rules:\n   - To beat their paper, I should play rock (not scissors)\n   - They've followed paper with rock, scissors, or paper historically\n\n7. Making my decision:\n   - Based on the clear rules and the opponent's tendency after paper plays\n   - Rock would win against paper with the highest payoff\n   - This aligns with the confirmed reverse rock-paper-scissors rules\n\n[move] rock\n"

Confirmed rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   \n3.

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves\n   - They've just lost significantly (-3 points) to my rock play\n   - They might anticipate I'll play rock again and switch to scissors\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to scissors (anticipating my rock), my paper would win\n   - If they stick with paper, my rock would win again\n   - If they switch to rock, my paper would lose heavily\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - After a significant loss, players often change strategy\n   - They may expect me to repeat rock after it worked well\n   - They're likely to switch to scissors to counter my expected rock\n\n7. Making my decision:\n   - Based on likely opponent adaptation after a significant loss\n   - Paper would win against their predicted scissors play\n   - This represents the most likely psychological response from the opponent\n\n[move] paper\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent changed from paper to scissors after losing\n   - They're now likely anticipating my next adaptation\n   - After scissors, they've historically played rock or scissors\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock next (common after scissors), my scissors would win\n   - If they play scissors again, scissors would tie\n   - If they play paper, scissors would lose\n\n5. Psychological assessment:\n   - I've won the last two rounds\n   - They may expect me to be overconfident and repeat my paper play\n   - They may play rock to counter my expected paper\n\n6. Recent pattern consideration:\n   - Looking at our most recent exchanges:\n     * I played rock, they played paper, I won\n     * I played paper, they played scissors, I won\n   - This suggests a cyclical adaptation where they're one step behind\n\n7.
