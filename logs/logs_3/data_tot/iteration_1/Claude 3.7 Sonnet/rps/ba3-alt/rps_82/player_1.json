The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

And my scissors beat their rock.\n\nGiven this success and our history, they might:\n1. Switch away from rock since it just lost to scissors\n2. Play paper expecting me to play scissors again\n3. Play scissors anticipating I might switch to rock or paper\n\nSince scissors was just successful, they'll likely expect me to play it again. I'll anticipate this expectation and play rock, which would beat paper if they switch to it. If they play scissors anticipating my switch, rock would lose minimally.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
