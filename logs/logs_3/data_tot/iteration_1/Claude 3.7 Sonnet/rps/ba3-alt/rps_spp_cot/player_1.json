Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points for both\n\n2. This is an unusual payoff structure. Let me analyze it:\n   - Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower stakes (+1/-1)\n   - Wait - there's an error in the rules as stated. Paper should beat rock, not scissors. But I'll go with the rules as stated.\n\n3. For my first move with no prior information about my opponent:\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Paper or scissors are lower risk\n   - Since this is the first round, a balanced approach might be best\n\n4. Given that rock offers the highest potential reward but also the highest potential penalty, I'll avoid it in the first round until I understand my opponent better.\n\n5. Between paper and scissors, both have the same risk/reward profile in the rules as stated.\n\n6. I'll choose paper for my first move, as it seems slightly safer given the conventional understanding of rock-paper-scissors (even though the rules stated have an unusual relationship between paper and scissors).\n\n[move] paper\n"

The pattern I thought I detected (alternating paper and scissors) was broken when my opponent played rock.\n\n4. Let me reassess the situation:\n   - My opponent seems to be adapting, making it difficult to predict their next move\n   - They've now played all three possible moves\n   - The last round was a tie with both of us playing rock\n\n5. After a tie with rock, what might they expect me to do?\n   - They might think I'll stay with rock (as it's safer than scissors against their previous paper)\n   - They might think I'll switch to paper to beat their rock\n   - They might think I'll switch to scissors to try something different\n\n6.

If I play scissors against their paper, I could lose again.\n\n9. Weighing all options, I'll play paper. If they play rock again, I win (+1). If they play scissors, I lose but only by a small margin (-1). If they play paper, it's another tie (0).\n\n[move] paper\n"

My prediction was correct - my opponent broke their pattern after losing twice. Instead of playing scissors as the pattern would suggest, they played rock, leading to a tie.\n\n4. Let me reassess their pattern now:\n   - Their last few moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Their previous pattern of alternating scissors and paper has been broken\n   - They might be adapting their strategy to counter my moves\n\n5. What might they expect me to play next?\n   - They might think I'll switch from rock since it resulted in a tie\n   - They might think I'll go back to paper which won me +1 points twice\n   - Or they might think I'll try scissors since I haven't used it recently\n\n6. What might they play next?\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock\n\n7. Looking at the overall game:\n   - Paper has been played by my opponent 4 times\n   - Scissors has been played by my opponent 3 times  \n   - Rock has been played by my opponent 2 times\n\n8. Since they just played rock (breaking their pattern), they might return to their preferred moves (paper or scissors). Paper seems most likely given their frequency of play.\n\n9. If I expect them to play paper, my best move would be rock for +3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at my recent moves, I've played rock three times in a row, which makes my strategy predictable. They successfully countered with scissors last round.\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to switch away from rock after losing, they might play paper (to counter scissors) or rock (to counter paper).\n\n9. If they expect me to stubbornly stick with rock, they might play scissors again.\n\n10. Given that I've been too predictable with rock, I need to change my move.

Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 4 times (including last move)\n   - Paper: 4 times\n   - Scissors: 3 times\n\n6. Since they just played rock and I countered successfully with scissors, they might:\n   - Play paper next to counter my potential scissors play\n   - Play rock again thinking I wouldn't expect it twice\n   - Play scissors to try something different\n\n7. If they play paper, rock would be my best move (+3)\n   If they play rock, scissors would be my best move (+1)\n   If they play scissors, paper would be my best move (+1)\n\n8. Given that they've just been countered with scissors against their rock, the most logical move for them would be paper to beat my potential scissors.\n\n9.

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   My moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. My prediction that they would play scissors after rock was correct, confirming they were following the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle, at least for this round.\n\n4. Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 7 times (including last move)\n   - Paper: 5 times\n   - Rock: 4 times\n\n5. Looking at their recent sequence:\n   - Their last four moves have been: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This strongly suggests they're cycling through paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. If they continue this cycle, their next move would be paper.\n\n7. Against paper, my best move would be rock for +3 points.\n\n8. There's still a risk they might break the pattern, but the evidence for this cycling pattern is getting stronger, especially in the last few rounds.\n\n9. I'll play rock to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   - Rock: 5 times (including last move)\n   - Paper: 5 times\n\n5. This breaks the paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycling pattern I thought I had identified. They played rock after scissors instead of paper.\n\n6. Looking at more recent trends:\n   - We've now had three rock-rock ties (rounds 4, 9, 15, 17)\n   - Their last five moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - No clear pattern is emerging consistently\n\n7. After a rock-rock tie, what might they play next?\n   - In round 5 (after our first rock-rock tie), they played scissors\n   - In round 10 (after our second rock-rock tie), they played scissors\n   - This suggests they might play scissors again after this rock-rock tie\n\n8. If they do play scissors, my best move would be paper (which beats scissors in this variant).\n\n9. Since we've seen this specific pattern twice before (rock-rock tie followed by scissors), I'll play paper expecting them to play scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   - Rock: 6 times (including last two moves)\n   - Paper: 5 times\n\n5. This is the first time they've played the same move three times in a row (rock).\n\n6. After playing rock three times consecutively, they might:\n   - Continue with rock if they think it's working (it just won them 3 points)\n   - Switch to scissors or paper to surprise me\n   - Play paper expecting me to play rock to counter their previous rock\n\n7. Since they just won significantly with rock, they might stick with it, expecting me to play scissors to counter their rock streak.\n\n8. If they play rock again, scissors would be my best move (+1).\n   If they switch to paper, scissors would lose (-1).\n   If they switch to scissors, paper would win (+1).\n\n9.

Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Their last moves have been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - After a streak of rocks, they switched to paper\n\n6. This game continues to be highly unpredictable. My attempts to find patterns have not been consistently successful.\n\n7. At this point, I need to consider that they might be deliberately avoiding patterns or responding to my moves in a complex way.\n\n8. Let's try a different approach. Rock has given me the highest rewards when successful (+3 against paper) and has resulted in ties when we both play it. It's a relatively safer choice than scissors or paper since the penalties are smaller (-1 against scissors versus -3 for paper against rock).\n\n9. I'll play rock, which:\n   - Would win significantly (+3) if they play paper again\n   - Would tie if they play rock\n   - Would lose but with minimal penalty (-1) if they play scissors\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 8 times (including last move)\n   - Rock: 6 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n\n5.

One observation is that they've never played the same move more than three times in a row (they played rock three times consecutively earlier).\n\n7. After playing scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (which they've done after scissors several times before)\n   - Switch to paper (which they did after scissors in round 14)\n   - Stick with scissors (though they've never played scissors twice in a row)\n\n8. Given their tendency to avoid playing the same move consecutively for scissors, and their overall preference for scissors (8 times), I think they're likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\n9. Paper has been my most successful move, winning me 4 rounds when I've played it.\n\n10. I'll play paper, which:\n    - Would win against scissors (+1) if they repeat their last move\n    - Would tie against paper if they switch to that\n    - Would lose against rock (-3) if they switch to that, which is a risk, but one I need to take to try to break my losing streak\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   My moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. Their latest moves have been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   They continue to be extremely unpredictable.\n\n4. Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (including last move)\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n\n5. I've now lost five rounds in a row, which is a significant losing streak.\n\n6. They've played scissors most frequently (9 times), and they've just played it again. They've never played scissors three times in a row, but they have played it twice in a row before (rounds 12-13).\n\n7. After playing scissors, historically they've most often switched to paper (4 times out of 8 previous scissors plays).\n\n8. At this point, I need to make a move that has the highest probability of breaking my losing streak.\n\n9. Paper is my most successful move so far, having won me 4 rounds when I've played it. It would also counter their scissors if they play it again.\n\n10. Given their tendency to follow scissors with paper historically, and my need to break this losing streak, I'll play scissors, which would win against paper (+1) if they switch to that.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   My moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Wait, there's confusion in my tracking. The hint says I played scissors against their rock and won (+1), which aligns with the rule \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point.\" This confirms my understanding of the rules.\n\n4. Their latest moves have been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock in the last few rounds.\n\n5. Their updated move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 9 times\n   - Rock: 8 times (including last move)\n   - Paper: 6 times\n\n6. After their rock move, historically they've most often played scissors (5 times out of 7 previous rock plays).\n\n7. If they maintain the scissors-rock alternating pattern they've shown in the last few rounds, they would play scissors next.\n\n8. Given this analysis:\n   - If they play scissors (likely based on recent pattern), paper would win (+1)\n   - If they play rock again (breaking the recent pattern), scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play paper (which they haven't played in a while), rock would win (+3)\n\n9. Since I just won with scissors against their rock, and they've been alternating between rock and scissors recently, I'll play paper to counter their potential scissors move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
