Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Each move (rock, paper, or scissors) has equal expected value in a one-shot game. The Nash equilibrium for Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play each option with 1/3 probability.\n\nPsychological Strategist: For the first move against a fresh player, it's worth noting that studies have shown rock is the most common opening move among novice players (approximately 35-36% of first throws). Paper is a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nData Analyst: Since this is the first round, we have no data on the opponent's patterns yet. After this round, I'll begin tracking their moves to identify any patterns or tendencies.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the psychological insight that rock is a common first move and the game theory principle that all options are theoretically equal in a one-shot game, I recommend playing paper for this opening round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This could indicate several things - either they tend to favor rock as a starting move, or they might be a player who sticks with the same move for multiple rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing a round, many players will switch their move. Studies show that players rarely play the same move three times in a row, and after a loss, there's an even stronger tendency to change strategies. The opponent might anticipate that we'll play paper again after our success, so they may switch to scissors to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: While the Nash equilibrium is still to play each move with equal probability, we can exploit patterns if they exist. If we believe the opponent will switch to scissors to counter our paper, we should play rock. However, if we believe they might stick with rock (thinking we'll change to scissors), we should play paper again.\n\nDecision Maker: The opponent lost with rock and likely knows we played paper. There are two main possibilities: 1) They switch to scissors expecting us to play paper again, or 2) They switch to paper as part of a typical rotation pattern. Since scenario 1 seems more likely based on psychological tendencies after a loss, I recommend playing rock for this round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Also, many novice players follow a \"rock-paper-scissors\" rotation regardless of outcome, which would mean paper is coming next. Playing rock counters both possibilities.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This could indicate either a rotation pattern (rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper) or a reactive strategy after losing.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Having lost twice in a row, the opponent is likely to change their strategy more dramatically. Many players believe that staying with a winning move is a good strategy, so they might anticipate us playing rock again and counter with paper. Alternatively, they might expect us to follow a rotation pattern (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors) and prepare to counter scissors with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown a tendency to make moves that would have lost to our previous move (scissors loses to our previous paper). If this pattern continues, they might play paper now (which would lose to our previous rock). To counter this, we should play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: We have two hypotheses: either the opponent is following a rotation pattern (which would mean paper next) or they're trying to counter our previous successful move (also paper). Both scenarios suggest they'll play paper next, so scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After two consecutive losses, they're unlikely to play scissors again since that would mean repeating a losing move.

They might try to break our winning streak by anticipating our next move and countering it. Since we just played scissors, they might expect us to play rock next (continuing our winning pattern) and counter with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might realize we've been successfully predicting their moves. This could lead to two strategies: either they'll break their pattern to try to surprise us, or they'll try to second-guess what we think they'll do. If they expect us to predict rock (following their rotation), they might play scissors instead.\n\nDecision Maker: We have two main possibilities: either the opponent continues their rotation (rock next) or they try to break the pattern. Given they've lost three times, breaking the pattern seems more likely. If we expect them to predict we'll play paper (to beat their expected rock), they would play scissors.

This suggests they may have tried to surprise us.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After three consecutive losses, the opponent tried to change their strategy and we tied. This partial success might encourage them to try a new approach rather than reverting to their previous pattern. After a tie with rock, many players would avoid playing rock again. Since we played rock last time, they might expect us to play paper now (thinking we'd follow the rotation) and counter with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, the opponent might be trying to establish a new pattern or might be using a mixed strategy now. After a tie, players often try to \"win\" the next round rather than playing for another tie. If they think we'll play paper next, they'll play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: The opponent has shown they're willing to break patterns after losing. The tie might reinforce this behavior. If they expect us to play paper (a common response to a rock tie), they would play scissors. To counter this, we should play rock again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.

They've now played paper twice in a non-consecutive pattern and successfully countered our rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After finally winning a round, the opponent might gain confidence in their strategy. Many players tend to stick with a winning move, so there's a decent chance they'll play paper again. However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: After a player wins a round, they have two common strategies: either stick with the winning move or anticipate that their opponent will counter their previous move and play accordingly. If they expect us to play scissors (to counter their paper), they'll play rock. If they stick with paper, we should play scissors.\n\nDecision Maker: Since we lost the last round, we definitely need to change our move. The opponent has shown adaptability by breaking patterns when necessary. Given they just won with paper, they might either repeat paper (thinking we'll play rock again) or switch to rock (anticipating we'll play scissors). The safer bet is to play scissors, as it either wins against paper or ties against scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think scissors is the right move here.

The most common reaction would be to play rock, which would have beaten the scissors that just beat them.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, the opponent might realize that we've been successfully predicting their moves consistently. Their best strategy might be to simply play the counter to what just beat them - rock beats the scissors we just played. This is a common fallback strategy when other approaches aren't working.\n\nDecision Maker: I believe rock is their most likely next move. They've lost repeatedly and will want to counter our last successful play (scissors). Given their losing streak, they're more likely to use a direct, reactive strategy than to engage in multi-level thinking. Therefore, we should play paper to counter their expected rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. With such a poor winning record so far, they'll likely fall back on the most basic counter-strategy - playing rock to beat our scissors. This is especially true if they're feeling frustrated or demoralized by their performance.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After losing with rock against our paper, they're highly likely to play scissors to counter our expected paper.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might also realize they've become predictable and try to break the pattern. However, when players are consistently losing, they tend to revert to simpler, more reactive strategies rather than complex mind games. The most straightforward response would be scissors, anticipating that we'll play paper again after it just won.\n\nDecision Maker: Given their pattern of play and psychological state after so many losses, scissors seems like their most probable next move. They'll expect us to continue with paper (our winning move) and will likely play scissors to counter it. Therefore, we should play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. At this point, they're likely to follow the most direct counter-strategy rather than attempting deeper levels of reasoning.

At this point, players often resort to very basic strategies or even completely random play. After losing with scissors against our rock, they're likely to play paper, which would beat the rock that just beat them. This is a common, almost instinctive response when other strategies have failed repeatedly.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've been successfully predicting their moves throughout most of the game, they might finally realize that they need to break their pattern of predictability. However, frustration often leads to simpler rather than more complex strategies. The most straightforward counter to our rock would be paper, and that's what we should expect.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree that paper is their most likely next move. They've lost repeatedly and will want to counter our last successful play (rock). Therefore, we should play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the possibility that they might try something completely different or random out of frustration.

Their pattern has remained remarkably consistent throughout the entire game - they play what would have beaten their previous losing move. After losing with rock against our paper, following this pattern, they'll likely play scissors (which would have beaten the paper that just beat them).\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's strategy has become entirely predictable. After such an extended losing streak, they're very unlikely to suddenly change their approach. The most probable move is scissors, anticipating that we'll play paper again.\n\nDecision Maker: Given their consistent pattern and psychological state after so many consecutive losses, scissors seems like their most probable next move. Therefore, we should play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The opponent has established such a strong and consistent pattern that breaking it would require a conscious effort, which is extremely difficult when experiencing such a prolonged losing streak. Rock is our optimal play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
