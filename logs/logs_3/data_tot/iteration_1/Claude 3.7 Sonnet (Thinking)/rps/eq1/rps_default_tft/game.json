This pattern is clearly deliberate and not random chance. \n\nThe opponent must be either:\n1. Seeing my move before making theirs\n2. Programmed specifically to mirror my moves\n3. Using some form of prediction that has perfect accuracy (extremely unlikely)\n\nSince we're playing a game where points are scored based on winning rounds, and we're consistently tying, neither of us is making any progress. At this point, I should consider if there's any way to break this pattern.\n\nGiven the rules of rock-paper-scissors and the current mirroring behavior:\n- If I play rock, they'll play rock \u2192 tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper, they'll play paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n- If I play scissors, they'll play scissors \u2192 tie (0 points)\n\nIt seems impossible to win if they can perfectly mirror my move. The only way to change this outcome would be if:\n1. The opponent changes their strategy\n2. There's some meta-rule I'm not aware of\n3. I could somehow make my move after seeing theirs (which doesn't seem possible in the game as described)\n\nFor now, I'll continue with the game and make another move, documenting this extraordinary pattern.",
