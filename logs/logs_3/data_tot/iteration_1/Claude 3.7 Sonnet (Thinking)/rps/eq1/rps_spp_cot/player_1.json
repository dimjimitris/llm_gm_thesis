    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In the absence of information, I need to consider psychological factors for a first move.\n\n3. Rock is statistically a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4. If my opponent plays Rock (a common first move), then Paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n5. While I could choose randomly, exploiting this potential tendency gives me a slight edge.\n\n6. Even if my opponent doesn't choose Rock, the worst outcome would be a loss of 1 point, which is manageable.\n\n7.

While there are other possibilities (they could stick with paper or switch to rock), the most common behavior after a tie is to switch to what would have beaten the previous move.\n\n7.

Let me review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. I've now won ten consecutive rounds by exploiting this perfectly predictable pattern.\n\n4. The pattern has remained consistent throughout all 13 rounds without any deviation.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern (which seems virtually certain), their next move would be rock.\n\n6. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n\n7. Given their complete commitment to this rigid pattern despite losing repeatedly, I expect them to continue it.\n\nFinal decision: Choose Paper\n\n[move] paper"
