(+1)\n\nMy current score: +2 points\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: Rock\n- Round 2: Rock \n- Round 3: Rock\n- Round 4: Scissors\n- Round 5: Rock\n- Round 6: Rock\n\nThe opponent seems to favor rock heavily (playing it 5/6 times). They only switched to scissors once, which was right after I played paper twice in a row.\n\nGiven this pattern, there's a high chance they'll continue playing rock, but they might switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper again (especially since I just played paper and won). \n\nI have a few strategies to consider:\n1. Play paper again - this has been successful 3/4 times, but they might anticipate this and play scissors\n2. Play scissors - would win if they switch to paper, but would lose if they play rock again\n3. Play rock - would result in another tie if they play rock, but would win if they switch to scissors\n\nSince the opponent has shown a strong preference for rock, and only deviated once after I played paper twice in a row, I'll play scissors this time. If they follow their pattern of mostly playing rock, I'll lose, but if they think I'll play paper again and choose scissors, then I'll tie. If they try to counter my previous paper with paper, I'll win.\n\nActually, let me rethink this. The opponent seems to strongly favor rock (5/6 rounds), and only deviated once. Playing paper has been my most successful strategy. While there's a risk they'll counter with scissors again, the higher probability based on their history is that they'll play rock.\n\nI'll go with paper for this round.",

Let's check if they might be using a simple strategy like changing based on the previous outcome:\n\nAfter they lose, what do they play next?\n- After losing with rock (rounds 1, 3, 6) \u2192 rock, rock, scissors\n- After losing with paper (rounds 10, 16, 17) \u2192 rock, paper, rock\n\nAfter they win, what do they play next?\n- After winning with scissors (rounds 4, 8, 12) \u2192 rock, scissors, rock\n- After winning with paper (round 10, 16) \u2192 rock, paper\n\nAfter a tie, what do they play next?\n- After tie with rock (rounds 2, 5, 13) \u2192 rock, rock, scissors\n- After tie with scissors (round 7, 14) \u2192 scissors, rock\n- After tie with paper (round 18) \u2192 rock\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern. Let me try another approach. Let me see if there's any frequency pattern:\n- Rock: 10 times\n- Paper: 5 times\n- Scissors: 5 times\n\nThey seem to play rock most frequently. Given that, playing paper would statistically be the best move. However, they've played rock in the last round, so they might switch to something else.\n\nLet me make a more strategic choice. Since they just played rock, they might anticipate me playing paper and therefore play scissors. So I could play rock to counter that. Or they might stick with rock again, in which case paper would be best.\n\nI'll go with paper as it has worked well against this opponent several times, and they seem to favor rock overall.",

For instance:\n- Round 9-10: I played rock and won, then opponent countered with paper\n- Round 15-16: I played paper and won, then opponent countered with paper\n- Round 17-18: I played scissors and won, then opponent countered with paper\n\nIt seems like the opponent may be attempting to predict my moves based on what worked for me in the previous round.\n\nFor this next round, I'll try scissors since my opponent has played paper the last two rounds.",

Many players tend to \"upgrade\" their move after a win (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\nSince I'm told this is a fresh player, they might default to a common first move like rock.

However, they seem to be slightly biased toward playing scissors in recent rounds.\n\nAnother approach is to consider if they might be countering my previous moves. Let me check:\n\nRound 1: I had no previous move, opponent played rock\nRound 2: My previous move was paper, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 3: My previous move was rock, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 4: My previous move was paper, opponent played scissors (counters my previous move)\nRound 5: My previous move was paper, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 6: My previous move was rock, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 7: My previous move was paper, opponent played scissors (counters my previous move)\nRound 8: My previous move was scissors, opponent played scissors (doesn't counter)\nRound 9: My previous move was paper, opponent played scissors (counters my previous move)\nRound 10: My previous move was rock, opponent played paper (counters my previous move)\nRound 11: My previous move was rock, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 12: My previous move was scissors, opponent played scissors (doesn't counter)\nRound 13: My previous move was paper, opponent played rock (doesn't counter)\nRound 14: My previous move was rock, opponent played scissors (doesn't counter)\n\nIt seems they've countered my previous move in 4 out of 14 rounds, which is less than what we'd expect by random chance.\n\nLooking at recent trends, the opponent has played scissors in the last round. If they're developing a pattern, they might play rock next since rock beats scissors. If they're trying to counter what they think I might play, they might anticipate that I'll play rock (to counter their scissors) and therefore play paper.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the best move would be to play scissors. It would beat paper if they're trying to counter me, and if they continue with scissors, it would be a tie. The risk is if they play rock, but I need to make a choice with the limited information I have.",

They never play paper after I play paper.\n\nAfter I play rock, they play either rock (tie) or paper (which beats my rock). They never play scissors after I play rock.\n\nGiven these observations, playing scissors might be a good strategy since my opponent seems to favor rock but has also shown a tendency to play scissors after I play paper. If they follow that pattern and play scissors after my recent paper play, they might play rock next, which would lose to my scissors.\n\nActually, I made a mistake in my pattern analysis.

Since I just played rock in the last round and they played paper, let's consider what they might play next. After I play rock, they have played paper 40% of the time, rock 40% of the time, and scissors 20% of the time.\n\nTo counter this, I should play scissors, which would beat their paper if they play it, tie with their scissors if they play that, and lose to their rock if they play that.

Let me check this:\n\nRound 2: My previous: paper \u2192 Opponent: rock (doesn't follow pattern)\nRound 3: My previous: rock \u2192 Opponent: rock (follows pattern - tie)\nRound 4: My previous: paper \u2192 Opponent: scissors (follows pattern - beats my previous)\n...\n\nActually, this is getting complex. Let me try another approach.\n\nBased on the frequency of my opponent's moves:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nMy opponent seems to favor rock, which would suggest that I should play paper more often. However, when I look at recent trends, my opponent seems to be adapting.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in their responses to my specific moves:\n\nWhen I play rock, opponent plays:\n- rock: 2 times (tie)\n- paper: 2 times (I lose)\n- scissors: 0 times\n\nWhen I play paper, opponent plays:\n- rock: 4 times (I win)\n- paper: 1 time (tie)\n- scissors: 3 times (I lose)\n\nWhen I play scissors, opponent plays:\n- rock: 2 times (I lose)\n- paper: 1 time (I win)\n- scissors: 2 times (tie)\n\nFrom this analysis, paper seems to be my best move historically, as it has given me the most wins. However, my opponent might be adapting and expecting this.\n\nSince I've played scissors in the last round and lost (opponent played rock), they might anticipate me switching to paper. If they're thinking ahead, they might play scissors to counter.\n\nGiven this, I could:\n1. Play rock to beat their anticipated scissors\n2. Play paper to test if they're continuing with rock\n3. Play scissors again to see if they change strategy\n\nI think the safest bet based on their pattern is to go with rock for this round, as they seem to favor playing rock generally, and they just played rock in the last round.",

They've played paper in the last two rounds. Based on past patterns, they might switch to a different move now, or continue with paper for one more round.\n\nIf they follow the pattern of playing the same move three times in a row (as seen with rock at the beginning and paper recently), they might play paper again.\n\nHowever, since I just won with scissors against their paper, they might anticipate me playing scissors again and counter with rock.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think I'll play rock for this round. This would beat their scissors if they anticipate my scissors play, and tie with their rock if they make that choice.",
