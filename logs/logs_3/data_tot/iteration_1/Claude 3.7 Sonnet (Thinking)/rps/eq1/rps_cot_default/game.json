The opponent might try to break this pattern of ties by making a move they think I won't anticipate.\n\nAfter a paper tie, scissors is a common follow-up move as players try to beat the previous tie. My opponent might expect me to play scissors, and therefore play rock to counter. Alternatively, they might expect me to anticipate this and play paper, in which case they would play scissors.\n\nGiven the history of two consecutive ties, I think my opponent will be eager to break the pattern and secure a win. The most straightforward way would be to play scissors against our tied paper move.",

This suggests they anticipated my scissors move. They've now won two of the last three rounds where we weren't tied.\n\nLooking at their recent actions, there's been quite a bit of variation, but they seem to have adapted to my patterns. After breaking our three-tie streak, they might be feeling confident and stick with rock since it just worked. Alternatively, they might expect me to counter their rock with paper, in which case they'd play scissors.\n\nI need to consider whether they're playing adaptively based on my moves or following their own pattern. Since they've successfully anticipated my last few moves, I should assume they're being adaptive rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nAfter players win with a particular move, they sometimes:\n1. Stick with what worked\n2. Anticipate their opponent will counter and make a counter-counter move\n3. Completely change their strategy to stay unpredictable\n\nIn this case, I believe they're more likely to anticipate I'll counter their rock with paper, so they'll play scissors.",
