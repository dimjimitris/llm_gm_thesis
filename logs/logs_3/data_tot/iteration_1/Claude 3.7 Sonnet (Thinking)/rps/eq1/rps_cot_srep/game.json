Based on psychology studies, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n4. If I choose paper, I would win against rock (earning 1 point), tie against paper (0 points), and lose against scissors (-1 points).\n5. Since rock is statistically the most common first choice for new players, paper gives me the highest expected value.\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

After a tie, players typically change their move.

They might switch back to scissors (their most common move)\n2. They might switch to paper to beat my expected rock\n3. They might stay with rock (least likely based on their pattern)\n\nSince they seem to have a strong preference for scissors overall, and have frequently returned to scissors after trying other moves, I think they're most likely to go back to scissors. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect rock from them (following their pattern) and try to counter with paper.\n\nAfter a tie, I think the most strategic move is to assume they'll revert to their most common move (scissors) and counter it with rock.\n\nBut actually, let me reconsider. After a tie, they might expect me to play paper (to beat their rock). If they think I'll play paper, they would play scissors.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me just focus on their overall tendencies - scissors has been their dominant move by far, so I think they're most likely to return to scissors after this tie, especially since they don't seem to play rock often.\n\nThe best counter to their expected scissors would be rock.",

This is unusual since it's not a rational response, but it's a clear pattern in their play.\n\nThey likely expect me to play rock again (win-stay strategy). To counter my expected rock play, they would logically play paper. However, their historical pattern doesn't show this logical adaptation - they've repeatedly gone back to scissors even after losing to rock.\n\nGiven their extremely strong scissors preference (64% of all moves) and their specific pattern of returning to scissors even after losing to rock, I believe they will most likely play scissors again.\n\nHowever, there's also a significant chance they might finally adapt and play paper to beat my rock.

After our last rock-rock tie, they might:\n\n1. Return to their preferred scissors (based on their overall bias)\n2. Play paper (anticipating I'll play rock again)\n3. Stay with rock (as they did after the previous rock tie)\n\nLooking at the most recent rounds, they've played:\nR20-R23: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nThis suggests they might be starting to alternate or trying to be less predictable. After rock ties, they historically played scissors (in 2 out of 3 cases), but they broke that pattern in the most recent case.\n\nGiven their strong scissors preference throughout the game but recent adaptation, I think paper is my best play. It will beat their rock if they repeat it, and will lose to scissors if they revert to their preference (which has become slightly less certain).",
