    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Based on psychology studies, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n4. If I choose paper, I would win against rock (earning 1 point), tie against paper (0 points), and lose against scissors (-1 points).\n5. Since rock is statistically the most common first choice for new players, paper gives me the highest expected value.\n6. The opponent has no information about my play style yet, so they can't predict my move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my strategic first move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent's moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. Looking at their pattern after ties:\n   - After the rock tie in Round 11, they played scissors\n   - After the rock tie in Round 18, they played scissors\n\n4. This suggests that after rock ties, they have a pattern of switching to scissors.\n\n5. Looking at their overall distribution:\n   - Scissors: 13 times (62%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (24%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (14%)\n\n6. Scissors remains their overwhelming preference throughout the game.\n\n7. Based on both their historical pattern after rock ties and their overall preference, they're most likely to play scissors next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at their move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 14 times (64%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (23%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (14%)\n\n4. I just won by playing rock against their scissors.\n\n5. Interestingly, after previous losses to my rock (Rounds 9, 16, 19), they've consistently gone back to scissors despite losing.\n\n6. Their scissors bias is extremely strong and persistent throughout the game, even when it causes them to lose.\n\n7. While they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper, their historical pattern strongly suggests they'll revert to their preferred scissors move.\n\n8. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors regardless of outcomes, rock remains my optimal play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at their move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 14 times (61%)\n   - Paper: 5 times (22%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (17%)\n\n3. Patterns after rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 11 tie: they played scissors\n   - After Round 18 tie: they played scissors\n   - After Round 21 tie: they played rock (breaking their pattern)\n\n4. They're showing some adaptation by playing more rocks recently.\n\n5. Their last few moves (R20-R23) were: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, suggesting a possible alternating pattern.\n\n6. Given their strong scissors preference throughout but recent adaptation, they might play scissors next (reverting to their preference) or continue with the apparent alternating pattern with scissors.\n\n7. Paper would be risky given their scissors bias, but rock has been a successful counter for me throughout the game.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again, which has proven most effective against this opponent's tendencies.\n\n[move] rock"
