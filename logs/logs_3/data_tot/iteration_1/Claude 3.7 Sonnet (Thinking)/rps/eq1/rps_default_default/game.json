In a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value. The game is completely symmetric.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological aspects to consider:\n1. Rock is often the most common first move for many players\n2. Some players might overthink and try to be strategic by choosing paper (expecting rock)\n\nGiven these considerations and the fact that I have no specific information about my opponent, I'll choose paper as my first move. This is a reasonable choice because:\n- If my opponent plays rock (a common first choice), I win\n- If my opponent plays paper, we tie\n- If my opponent plays scissors, I lose\n\nNo strategy in a single round without prior information can guarantee a win, but this seems like a reasonable first move based on general human tendencies in Rock-Paper-Scissors.",

Stick with paper again (expecting me to change)\n2. Switch to scissors (to beat my paper if I play it again)\n3. Switch to rock (expecting me to switch to scissors)\n\nSince I think the most likely move from my opponent would be to switch to scissors (to beat my previous paper move), I'll choose rock to counter that potential scissors play.\n\nThis is a probabilistic strategy - there's no guaranteed winning move in rock-paper-scissors against an unpredictable opponent, but making educated guesses based on common patterns can provide an edge.",

If they play something else, it will give me more information about their strategy.\n\nRock-paper-scissors is a game of psychological strategy. Since we've had two ties in a row, breaking this pattern is important. Scissors is a good choice because:\n- If they're trying to predict my next move, they might expect me to continue with a pattern (like paper again)\n- If they're using a common RPS strategy like \"rock is the most common first move\", they might switch to paper after playing rock\n\nLet me go with scissors for this round.",

There's no mathematically superior first move in a truly random game.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological tendencies that have been observed in Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n1. Rock is often a popular first choice for many players (especially males), as it symbolizes strength\n2. Many game theorists suggest choosing Paper as a first move since it beats the common Rock opening\n3. Some players might anticipate this reasoning and go with Scissors\n\nWithout any specific information about my opponent, I'll go with Paper as my first move, as it's a good counter to the most common opening move (Rock).",

Then I lost with scissors vs rock and paper vs scissors.\n4. Then I won with scissors vs paper.\n5. Then we had several more ties.\n6. Most recently I lost with paper vs scissors.\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be employing some kind of strategy where they initially just match my moves to learn my patterns, then start trying to predict and counter my moves.\n\nOne common strategy in Rock Paper Scissors is to play what would have beaten your previous move, as many players subconsciously shift in this pattern. Another strategy is to play what would beat what your opponent just played.\n\nI should try to mix up my strategy and be less predictable. Since my last move was paper and I lost against scissors, the opponent might expect me to play rock next (a natural response after losing to scissors). To counter this expectation, I'll play scissors instead.",

Then back to a counter-move.\n\nThis suggests the opponent may be using an algorithm to decide their moves based on my previous behavior. They seem to have switched strategies after 11 rounds.\n\nGiven this pattern, I should try to predict their next move and counter it. If they're following a pattern of switching between strategies, they might try to beat my next move again.\n\nIf I played Paper, the opponent might play Scissors to counter.\nIf I played Rock, the opponent might play Paper to counter.\nIf I played Scissors, the opponent might play Rock to counter.\n\nSince the opponent just countered my Paper with Scissors, they might be in a \"counter mode\" again.

In rounds 13, 14, and 17, the opponent correctly anticipated my move and countered it. \n\nLet me think strategically. Given that I don't have a clear pattern identified, my best move might be to randomize. However, if there's a chance the opponent is trying to predict my move, I should try to be less predictable.\n\nI've played paper most recently, and if the opponent is anticipating that I'll play rock next (a common sequence is paper \u2192 rock), then they might play paper.

In round 18, I played rock and tied with rock.\n9.
