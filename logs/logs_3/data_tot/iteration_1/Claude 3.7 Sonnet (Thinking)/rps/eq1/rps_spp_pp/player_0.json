    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The Nash equilibrium is to randomize with equal probability.\n\nPsychology Expert: Studies show \"rock\" is slightly more common as a first move among new players. If we're assuming the opponent follows typical human patterns, paper would give a slight statistical edge.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first round, we can't yet analyze patterns. I recommend starting with paper based on the psychological tendency, then tracking the opponent's moves to identify patterns for future rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that paper is a reasonable first move. Without any information, exploiting the small statistical tendency for opponents to choose rock first gives us our best chance at a positive outcome.\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us our first data point about their behavior.\n\nPsychology Expert: In RPS, there's a common psychological pattern called \"win-stay\" where players repeat a winning move. Since scissors just worked for them, there's a reasonable chance they'll use scissors again.\n\nPattern Analyst: While we only have one data point, we need to make a decision based on the limited information. If they're using a win-stay strategy, they'll play scissors again. If they're thinking one level deeper, anticipating that we'll counter with rock, they might play paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, our best counter to their potential scissors repeat would be rock. Even if they're using more sophisticated reasoning, rock is a reasonable choice that protects us against their most recent winning move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The win-stay tendency is quite strong, especially after the first successful move in a game.\n\n[move] rock"

Since we both played rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper next, thinking we might repeat rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their sequence so far (scissors \u2192 rock), they might be following a clockwise rotation pattern in the standard RPS cycle. If so, their next move would be paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Both psychological analysis and pattern analysis point to paper as their likely next move. The optimal counter to paper would be scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

Their moves follow a perfect rotation through the RPS cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they continue this rotation pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Another important factor: they just lost. Players often change strategies after a loss. However, if they're unconsciously following a rotation pattern, they may continue it without realizing.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the clear rotation pattern observed, and assuming they haven't detected that we've noticed this pattern, the highest expected value play is rock to counter their likely scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now lost twenty-one rounds in a row. Their unwavering commitment to the rotation pattern despite continued losses confirms they are definitely following a programmed algorithm rather than making adaptive decisions.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the perfect consistency of the pattern through twenty-three rounds and twenty-one consecutive losses, we can be absolutely certain they will continue with the rotation. Paper would be their next move in the rotation, making scissors our optimal counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. The pattern has been followed perfectly without any deviation. Scissors is clearly our best move against their anticipated paper.\n\n[move] scissors"
