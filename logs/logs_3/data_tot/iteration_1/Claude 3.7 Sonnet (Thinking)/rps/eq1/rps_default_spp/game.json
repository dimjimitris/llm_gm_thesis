The opponent switched from paper to rock after our first tie, which suggests they might be following similar predictive logic to what we discussed.\n\nPsychologist: This pattern is revealing. After a paper tie, they chose rock rather than scissors. This breaks from the common pattern of switching to what would beat the previous move. Instead, they might be trying to predict our move and counter it, or they're following some internal sequence.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the sequence, a common pattern after consecutive ties is for players to complete a cycle. Since we've seen paper\u2192rock, many players would naturally play scissors next to complete the rock-paper-scissors sequence.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play scissors next, our optimal move would be rock again.

After a loss, players often change their strategy more dramatically than after ties or wins.\n\nPsychologist: This is a critical moment psychologically. After losing, many players tend to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's winning move. Since we won with rock, there's a strong likelihood they'll play paper to counter rock if they played again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The data confirms this. Studies show approximately 60% of players will switch to what would beat their opponent's last move after a loss. There's a high probability our opponent will play paper in this round.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play paper, our optimal counter is scissors. There's also the possibility they might try to be more unpredictable after a loss, but the paper response is most probable based on established patterns.\n\nPsychologist: Another factor is that they may be recognizing a pattern in our play. We've played rock twice in a row, so they might expect us to play rock again and counter with paper. Using scissors would be effective against this reasoning.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at all variables, scissors offers the highest expected value for this round based on loss-response patterns and the sequence of moves thus far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Now we need to anticipate how they'll respond to losing twice in a row. This is a different psychological state than a single loss.\n\nPsychologist: After consecutive losses, players often become more unpredictable or revert to what they perceive as their \"strongest\" move. Many players consider rock as their default \"strong\" move. Alternatively, they might try to anticipate our next move based on our winning pattern.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at our sequence, we've gone from rock to scissors. The opponent might expect us to complete the cycle by playing paper next. If they're trying to counter that anticipated move, they would play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Our recent winning moves were rock and scissors. If the opponent is looking for patterns, they might expect us to play the move that beats our last winning move - which would be rock (to beat scissors). In that case, they would likely play paper.\n\nPsychologist: After consecutive losses, players often try to \"reset\" the game mentally. Many revert to rock in this situation as it feels psychologically safer or stronger. However, they might also be trying to break our momentum by predicting and countering our next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, the highest probability moves from our opponent are either rock (as a psychological reset) or paper (if they're trying to counter our anticipated rock). Between these, paper has a slightly higher probability based on observed patterns of consecutive loss responses.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict paper is their most likely move, scissors would be our optimal play again. However, this creates a risk of becoming predictable ourselves by playing scissors twice in a row.\n\nPsychologist: I still think rock is the best move here. It would beat their scissors if they're anticipating our paper, and it would tie if they're resetting to rock. Only if they play paper would we lose, but that seems less likely given the psychological pressure of consecutive losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests they might be trying to stabilize the game and break our winning streak. Players often use rock as a \"reset\" move when they're losing, which is exactly what happened.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the full sequence of their moves, there's no obvious repeating pattern yet. However, it's worth noting what happened last time after a rock-rock tie in round 2 - they played scissors in round 3, which we countered correctly with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that history, there's a possibility they might avoid making the same move after the same situation. Since they played scissors after our last rock-rock tie (and lost), they might switch to paper this time.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Players tend to avoid repeating strategies that recently failed them. Since playing scissors after a rock-rock tie resulted in a loss for them previously, they're likely to try paper instead. They're probably also noticing we've played rock multiple times.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The probability distribution suggests paper as their most likely next move, both based on avoiding their previous losing pattern and attempting to counter our frequent rock plays.

They seem to be playing the classic sequence of rock-paper-scissors in order, regardless of outcome.\n\nPsychologist: That's an astute observation. Some players, especially when they don't have a clear winning strategy, resort to simple cyclical patterns. If they're following this pattern, their next move would predictably be paper to continue the cycle.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The evidence strongly supports this theory. They've completed two full cycles of paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors regardless of game outcomes. The probability they'll play paper next, continuing this pattern, is significantly higher than random chance.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play paper, our optimal counter is scissors.

The opponent might predict that I will move away from paper (since we tied), so they might choose rock (expecting me to choose scissors) or scissors (expecting me to choose rock).\n\nPsychologist would suggest that after ties, players often try to \"upgrade\" to the move that would have beaten the previous tie. So since we both played paper, the opponent might choose scissors (which beats paper).\n\nStatistical Analyst would note that after ties in rock-paper-scissors, the most common pattern is for players to shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. Since the opponent chose paper last time, statistically they might be more likely to choose scissors next.\n\nConsidering all these perspectives, it seems the opponent has a higher likelihood of choosing scissors in this next round.

After a paper tie, they chose rock rather than scissors. This breaks from the common pattern of switching to what would beat the previous move. Instead, they might be trying to predict our move and counter it, or they're following some internal sequence.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the sequence, a common pattern after consecutive ties is for players to complete a cycle.

After losing, many players tend to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's winning move. Since we won with rock, there's a strong likelihood they'll play paper to counter rock if they played again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The data confirms this.

Many revert to rock in this situation as it feels psychologically safer or stronger. However, they might also be trying to break our momentum by predicting and countering our next move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Considering all factors, the highest probability moves from our opponent are either rock (as a psychological reset) or paper (if they're trying to counter our anticipated rock).

(6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
