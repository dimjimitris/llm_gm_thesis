    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player.

However, there are known psychological patterns we can exploit.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Indeed! Studies show that in the first round, rock is the most common opening move among new players (approximately 35-40% of people), as it symbolizes strength and stability. Paper would be a logical counter to this tendency.\n\nStatistical Strategist: While there's no pattern to analyze yet, I agree with the psychological insight. Additionally, many experienced players might anticipate this and open with paper, making scissors potentially advantageous as a counter-counter strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is a fresh player, I recommend following the psychological insight - play paper as our first move to counter the statistically common rock opening.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Agreed. If we're playing against someone who hasn't developed a specific strategy yet, paper has the highest expected value based on first-move tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Let's analyze what just happened and strategize for the next move.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychological Analyst, Statistical Strategist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent played paper in the first round, which gives us our first data point. Now we need to predict how they'll reason about the next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, players often change their move because they feel the need to \"break\" the tie. Research suggests that players frequently shift to the option that would have beaten their previous move - so our opponent might switch to scissors thinking it would beat their own previous paper.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Based on patterns observed in RPS tournaments, after a tie, approximately 50-60% of players switch to a different move. Since both players played paper, there's a higher probability the opponent will switch to either rock or scissors, with scissors being slightly more common.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to switch to scissors, we should play rock. However, if they're anticipating our switch and employ a double-counter strategy, they might play rock expecting us to play scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given this is a fresh player without advanced strategy experience, they're more likely to follow the simple pattern of shifting to scissors after a paper tie. The double-anticipation strategy requires more sophisticated reasoning that's less common among casual players.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I agree. The most probable move from our opponent is scissors, which makes rock our optimal counter. Even if they don't switch, rock still beats their original paper if they repeat it.\n\nGame Theorist: There's always the possibility they'll play rock, in which case our rock would tie. But based on the available information and probability, rock offers the highest expected value right now.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We've had two consecutive ties, which means the opponent is thinking along similar lines as us. Let's analyze the pattern so far: paper \u2192 rock. We need to predict their next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After two consecutive ties, players often feel even stronger pressure to \"win\" the next round. The natural progression in RPS is rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, so there's a psychological tendency to follow this cycle. Based on that, our opponent might choose paper next.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I notice that both players have shifted in the same direction - from paper to rock. This could indicate that the opponent is using similar reasoning to ours. If they continue this pattern thinking, they might expect us to play paper and therefore play scissors to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: There are two key possibilities: (1) they expect us to play paper and will play scissors to counter, or (2) they'll follow the natural cycle and play paper themselves. If we believe scenario 1 is more likely, we should play rock. If we believe scenario 2, we should play scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that we've had two ties in a row, I believe the opponent is more likely to break the pattern than continue it. The frustration of consecutive ties often leads to more unpredictable behavior. I'm leaning toward them playing scissors to attempt to break the pattern completely.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at the full history (paper \u2192 rock), if they're pattern-matching, they might view this as us \"cycling backward\" through the RPS sequence. If they think we'll continue this backward cycle, they'll expect us to play scissors next and would play rock to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all these insights, I recommend playing paper. It beats rock (if they stick with it or predict we'll play scissors), and it's different enough from our previous move to possibly break the tie cycle.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent seems to be able to match or counter our moves effectively. Let's carefully analyze their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After two ties, the opponent finally won with scissors. This success may reinforce their strategy. Players who just won tend to either repeat their winning move (stick with scissors) or anticipate that we'll adjust and play rock to counter their scissors, in which case they might play paper.\n\nStatistical Strategist: The complete sequence for the opponent has been: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This is exactly following the traditional RPS cycle. If they continue this pattern-based approach, they would play rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: This is a critical insight. If they're following a pattern, we should expect rock. If they're using a win-stay strategy, they'll play scissors again. If they're anticipating our counter to their last move, they'll play paper expecting us to play rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that they just experienced their first win, I think the strongest psychological effect would be either win-stay (scissors again) or anticipating our adaptation (paper). The pattern-following behavior (rock) seems less likely when a winning move has just been discovered.\n\nStatistical Strategist: However, if they recognize the pattern themselves, they might deliberately play rock to complete the cycle. Looking at tournament data, after a player wins with scissors, the most common follow-up move is actually rock (about 40%), followed by repeating scissors (35%).\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all possibilities, I believe our best move is scissors. It beats paper (if they anticipate our rock), ties with scissors (if they repeat their winning move), and only loses to rock (if they follow the pattern).\n\nPsychological Analyst: I slightly disagree. Since we've been caught in patterns so far, I suggest breaking the cycle completely with rock. It beats scissors (if they repeat) and would signal unpredictability.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Based on the statistical likelihood of opponent behaviors after winning with scissors, rock would indeed have the highest expected value.\n\nGame Theorist: After weighing all perspectives, I agree that rock is our optimal move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've played: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. We've had two ties followed by two wins for them. This is concerning.\n\nStatistical Strategist: The opponent seems to be following a classic RPS cycle (rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock), but shifted one step ahead of us. They might be anticipating our moves or we're falling into a predictable pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: We've lost twice in a row now, which puts us in a psychologically defensive position. The opponent has gained confidence and may continue with their successful strategy. Their sequence so far perfectly counters what we've played.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're truly cycling (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper), their next move would be scissors. However, they might also be adaptively countering us, in which case they'll play whatever beats what they think we'll play.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given our consecutive losses, we need to break any pattern they might have detected. Random play might be our best strategy now to regain unpredictability.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their full sequence (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper), if they continue the pattern, they'll play scissors next. To counter that, we should play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they've recognized our attempts to counter and are playing one step ahead, they might anticipate rock and play paper again. This is getting complex.\n\nPsychological Analyst: At this point, I suggest scissors. Here's why: if they're following their cycle, they'll play scissors (tie). If they're expecting us to play rock to counter their pattern, they'll play paper (our scissors win). If they're completely switching strategies due to success, scissors still has a 1/3 chance.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I agree with scissors.

If they continue this pattern, they will play scissors next.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is crucial. They've won three times in a row following this simple cycling strategy. Given their success, they have little incentive to change their approach. Players who find a winning pattern typically stick with it until it stops working.\n\nGame Theorist: Our attempts to outthink them have actually worked against us.

Most players using a simple cycling strategy will stick with it even after one loss. They would only change after multiple failures.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Statistically speaking, the probability of them continuing the pattern is high. In RPS tournaments, players using cycling strategies typically need 2-3 consecutive losses before changing approach.

After just one loss following three wins, most players would attribute the loss to chance rather than their strategy being compromised.

Seven rounds with no deviation. If this pattern continues, they will play rock next.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is where psychology becomes crucial. After losing two consecutive rounds, the opponent is much more likely to recognize that their pattern has been detected. They have a few choices: continue the pattern (hoping we don't follow through), break the pattern completely, or even reverse the pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree this is a pivotal moment. The opponent has two consecutive losses after three consecutive wins. They're likely to change strategy now.\n\nStatistical Strategist: While a strategy change is possible, the evidence across 7 rounds shows extreme consistency. Many players commit deeply to patterns even when they start losing. If they continue the pattern, they'll play rock next, which would make paper our optimal counter.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also the possibility of a \"double-think\" scenario - they might expect us to expect rock, so they play paper instead. However, given their demonstrated straightforward approach so far, complex reasoning seems less likely.\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing all factors, I still believe the most probable move from the opponent is rock.

The opponent has broken their pattern for the first time. Let's analyze the complete sequence:\n- Round 1-8: The opponent followed a perfect paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle\n- Round 9: We expected scissors based on the pattern, but they played paper instead\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a classic adaptation point. After three consecutive losses, they finally recognized their pattern was detected and changed strategy. This is exactly when most players would adapt.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Let's consider what this means. After 8 rounds of perfect cycling, they've deviated. This suggests they're now consciously making strategic choices rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: There are several possibilities:\n1. They've completely abandoned the cycling strategy\n2. They've reversed the cycle direction (going rock \u2192 paper instead of rock \u2192 scissors)\n3. They're playing completely randomly now\n4. They're using a new pattern we haven't identified yet\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that they just won after three consecutive losses, they're likely to continue with their new approach. Most players gain confidence from successful adaptations.\n\nStatistical Strategist: If they've reversed their cycle, they would play scissors next. If they're trying to stay one step ahead of us, they might anticipate us playing scissors (to counter their expected paper) and play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: With only one data point post-pattern-break, our prediction confidence is lower. However, I think the most likely scenario is that they've reversed their cycle direction, suggesting scissors as their next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The simplest adaptation for most players is to reverse an existing pattern rather than create a completely new one.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, we should play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\nStatistical Strategist: While there's uncertainty, rock does maximize our expected value based on the available information.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at just the last few moves, I notice paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. This could indicate a new alternating pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After breaking their original pattern and winning in round 9, they might be testing a new strategy. The tie in round 10 gives us an interesting data point - they're not immediately reverting to their old pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're now alternating between paper and rock, their next move would be paper. However, we should consider other possibilities.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, many players feel an urge to \"win\" the next round rather than tie again. Given their previous success with paper against our rock, they might be inclined to play paper again.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their recent behavior:\n- When we expected scissors (round 9), they played paper and won\n- When we expected scissors again (round 10), they played rock and tied\n\nThis suggests they're actively trying to counter our predictions rather than following a fixed pattern now.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their apparent shift to a more adaptive strategy, and the recent paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock sequence, paper seems most likely as their next move.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I agree. The alternating pattern hypothesis has the most statistical support from recent moves.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I concur. After breaking their original pattern and winning, then experiencing a tie, they're likely to return to what recently worked for them (paper).\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, scissors would be our optimal counter to their expected paper move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at the last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), something interesting is happening - it looks like they might be returning to their original cycle.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This makes psychological sense. After breaking their pattern once and then experiencing two consecutive ties, they might be feeling that their original strategy was actually better. Players often revert to what worked previously after unsuccessful experimentation.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're indeed reverting to their original cycle, their next move would be paper. The sequence of their last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) exactly matches the start of their original cycle.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Analyzing the entire match, the original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern appears 3.5 times in the first 8 rounds, was briefly interrupted with their paper move in round 9, and now seems to be reestablishing with rock \u2192 scissors in rounds 10-11.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Two consecutive ties often lead players to revert to previously successful patterns. The fact that their deviation in round 9 resulted in a win but was followed by two ties might reinforce their belief that their original pattern was more effective overall.\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all factors, I believe paper is their most likely next move. To counter this, we should play scissors.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I agree.

However, they might also recognize that we've predicted their pattern correctly and try to deviate again.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their behavior throughout the game, they've shown a strong preference for this cycle. They maintained it for 8 straight rounds, briefly deviated, and then returned to it. Statistically speaking, rock remains the most probable next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree.

However, there's an increased probability they'll deviate now after consecutive losses.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Despite the psychological pressure to change, this opponent has shown remarkable consistency in their strategy. They've followed the same basic pattern in 11 out of 13 rounds. The statistical evidence still points to scissors as their most probable next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree that scissors is the most likely move if they continue their pattern. However, I assess a roughly 30% chance they'll break pattern now due to consecutive losses. If they do break pattern, they might play rock again (believing we wouldn't expect repetition) or paper (reversing the cycle).\n\nGame Theorist: Weighing all factors, scissors remains the highest probability move from the opponent.

Even after three consecutive losses, they've maintained the pattern. Their next move, if they continue, would be paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This is a critical psychological threshold. Three consecutive losses typically trigger a significant strategy change in most players. However, this particular opponent has shown unusual commitment to their pattern throughout the game. \n\nGame Theorist: I agree this is a key decision point. The opponent has clearly been detected and consistently countered for three rounds. They have two main options: either completely abandon their pattern or stubbornly stick to it believing we might expect them to change.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After three consecutive losses using the same pattern, the psychological pressure to change is extremely strong. Even a player who has been committed to a pattern would typically break it at this point.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their overall behavior, they've followed the same pattern in 12 out of 14 rounds. However, the recent consecutive losses dramatically increase the probability of deviation.\n\nGame Theorist: If they stick to their pattern, they'll play paper. If they break pattern, they're most likely to either repeat their last move (scissors) or jump to an unexpected move (rock).\n\nPsychological Analyst: I believe the most likely scenario is that they'll break their pattern. Given their demonstrated behavior of only minor deviations so far, they might simply reverse their cycle (playing scissors again).\n\nGame Theorist: Considering all perspectives, I believe scissors is our optimal move.

They've now broken their pattern twice, both times after experiencing losses. The first break (round 9) came after losing three straight rounds. This second break (round 15) came after losing three straight rounds again.\n\nPsychological Analyst: This confirms standard psychological principles - players typically maintain patterns until they experience a threshold of negative feedback. For this player, that threshold appears to be three consecutive losses.\n\nGame Theorist: Now we need to predict what they'll do next. Having just won by breaking their pattern, they have three main options:\n1. Return to their original pattern (which would mean paper next)\n2. Start a new pattern (insufficient data to predict)\n3. Play unpredictably to avoid being countered\n\nPsychological Analyst: After experiencing success by breaking their pattern, most players gain confidence in adaptation rather than rigid patterns. However, this particular player has shown a strong tendency to return to their comfort zone (the original pattern) even after deviations.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their previous behavior after breaking pattern (round 9), they played rock \u2192 scissors in the next two rounds, which actually aligned with their original pattern. This suggests they may return to their pattern even after a successful deviation.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their historical preference for their original pattern, I believe there's a significant probability they'll return to it and play paper next. However, they might also repeat rock after its recent success.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. The win they just experienced might not be enough to completely abandon their deeply ingrained pattern. Many players revert to familiar patterns even after temporary success with deviation.\n\nGame Theorist: In this case, paper seems to be our optimal move.

They've switched to a new alternating pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n2. They're now actively countering what they think we'll play\n3. They're playing unpredictably to avoid being predictable\n4. This is just a temporary deviation and they'll return to their original pattern\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that they won with this deviation, they're likely to continue with whatever new approach they're using. Success reinforces strategic choices.\n\nStatistical Strategist: If they've switched to an alternating pattern between paper and rock, their next move would be rock.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the possibility they're now trying to directly counter us. They might expect us to play scissors (to counter their paper), so they might play rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given their history throughout the game, they seem to prefer simple patterns over complex counter-strategies. The alternating pattern hypothesis seems most aligned with their demonstrated behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they're now alternating between paper and rock, with rock coming next, our optimal move would be paper.\n\nStatistical Strategist: While there's uncertainty after this pattern break, paper appears to be our best move based on the available evidence.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They've followed it consistently for four consecutive rounds. If they continue, their next move would be paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Having just lost again, they may consider changing their strategy. However, they've shown throughout this game that they tend to commit to patterns and only deviate after multiple consecutive losses. One loss is unlikely to break their new pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Their behavior throughout has demonstrated a preference for simple, consistent patterns rather than complex adaptive strategies. They appear to have switched from their original three-move cycle to a simpler two-move alternating pattern.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Based on the observed paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock sequence, paper has a very high probability of being their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter their expected paper move, scissors would be our optimal play.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I concur.

If they continue, their next move would be rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've now lost two consecutive rounds. This puts some pressure on them to change strategy, but based on their behavior throughout the game, they typically need more consecutive losses before abandoning a pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: Their behavior has been remarkably consistent throughout - they commit to simple patterns and only deviate after suffering multiple consecutive losses (typically three or more). Given they've only lost twice, they're likely to continue their alternating pattern.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their entire play history, they've demonstrated a strong preference for pattern-based play rather than adaptive counter-strategies. The statistical evidence strongly supports rock as their next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: I agree. While some players might change strategy after two losses, this particular opponent has shown higher pattern commitment. They appear to find comfort in predictable sequences rather than trying to outthink their opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect rock as their next move, our optimal counter is paper.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Paper maximizes our expected value based on all available information.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has broken their alternating pattern. Let's update our analysis:\n- Rounds 17-21: They played paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper (alternating pattern)\n- Round 22: They played scissors instead of the expected rock\n\nStatistical Strategist: This pattern break comes after they lost two consecutive rounds using their alternating pattern. This is consistent with their previous behavior - they tend to break patterns after experiencing consecutive losses.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Throughout this game, they've consistently shown they prefer pattern-based play but will adapt after multiple losses. They typically return to pattern-based play after successful deviations.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the possibilities for their next move:\n1. They might be returning to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle (which would mean paper next)\n2. This could be a one-time deviation before returning to their alternating pattern (rock next)\n3. They could be starting a completely new pattern\n4. They might be shifting to more adaptive counter-play\n\nStatistical Strategist: Looking at their entire history, after breaking patterns they typically either return to their original pattern or establish a new simple pattern. They've rarely demonstrated complex counter-strategies.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that they just won with scissors, they may continue with whatever new approach they're using. However, their history suggests they prefer to settle into predictable patterns rather than play unpredictably.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're returning to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle, they would play paper next after scissors. If they're just making a temporary deviation, they might return to their alternating pattern with rock.\n\nStatistical Strategist: Given their demonstrated preference for simple patterns throughout the game, I believe rock is more likely than paper. The alternating pattern is simpler and more recent than their original three-move cycle.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Their most likely next move is rock, either as a return to their alternating pattern or as a counter to our expected scissors play. To counter rock, our optimal move is paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: While there's uncertainty after a pattern break, paper appears to be our best move based on their demonstrated behavior throughout the game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This could indicate they're developing a new pattern or playing more adaptively.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After winning with scissors in round 22, they may have expected us to play rock to counter potential scissors again, which would explain their paper play. The tie result gives us limited information about how they'll respond next.\n\nGame Theorist: There are several possibilities:\n1. They could be returning to their original paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle (suggesting rock next)\n2. They might be trying to restart their paper \u2192 rock alternating pattern (suggesting rock next)\n3. They could be playing more adaptively now, trying to predict and counter our moves\n\nStatistical Strategist: Throughout this game, this opponent has consistently shown a preference for pattern-based play over adaptive counter-play. Even when they've deviated, they've typically returned to pattern-based strategies.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, many players feel pressure to \"win\" the next round.

This convergence suggests rock is indeed their most probable next move.\n\nStatistical Strategist: I agree.
