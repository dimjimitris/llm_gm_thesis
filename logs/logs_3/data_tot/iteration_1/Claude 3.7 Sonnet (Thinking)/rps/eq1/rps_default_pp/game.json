This is a common pattern in rock-paper-scissors - players often counter what beat them last time.\n\n3.

In that case, they might play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I should play scissors, which would beat their paper if they follow this pattern.\n\nHowever, they could also be using a different strategy. They might:\n1. Stick with rock since it just won them a round\n2. Try to predict that I'll switch and adjust accordingly\n3. Be playing completely randomly\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- If I play rock: I win if they play scissors, lose if they play paper, tie if they play rock\n- If I play paper: I win if they play rock, lose if they play scissors, tie if they play paper\n- If I play scissors: I win if they play paper, lose if they play rock, tie if they play scissors\n\nSince my opponent just played rock and won, they might be more likely to stick with rock.

Their move is always the one that would lose to my current move.\n\nFor this next round, I should continue with the pattern I've been using since it's working so well. Following rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock..., my next move should be rock.",
