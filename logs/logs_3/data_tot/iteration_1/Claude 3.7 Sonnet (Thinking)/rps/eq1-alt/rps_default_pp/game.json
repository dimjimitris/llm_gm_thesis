The rules are actually reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors. In this game:\n- paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- rock beats paper (same as standard)\n- scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nRound 2:\n- I played scissors\n- Opponent played rock\n- I won (scissors beats rock in this variant)\n- I scored 1 point\n\nNow I need to make my third move. My opponent has played scissors and then rock. They might be trying to establish a pattern or predict my moves based on my previous wins.\n\nSince I've won twice, they might expect me to be confident and stick with scissors since it worked last time. Or they might think I'll try to counter what they'll play next.\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors again, they might play paper (which beats scissors in this variant).\nIf they think I'll anticipate this and play rock, they might play scissors (which beats rock).\n\nI think I'll play paper here, which would beat scissors if they play that.",

The rules were initially described incorrectly and are actually reversed\n2. My opponent is following a predictable pattern, always playing what would normally beat my previous move\n3. The game is designed this way for some reason\n\nRegardless of which is true, I should continue with the same cycle that has been working:\n- rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock -> etc.\n\nSince my last move was scissors, I should play rock next to continue the pattern.",

There's some other mechanic at play\n\nBased on what I've seen so far:\n- When I play paper, I win against scissors (which contradicts normal rules where scissors beats paper)\n- When I play scissors, I win against rock (which contradicts normal rules where rock beats scissors)\n- When I play rock, I win against paper (which contradicts normal rules where paper beats rock)\n\nThis pattern has been 100% consistent for 23 rounds now. The most logical explanation is that either:\n- The opponent is programmed to always lose\n- The winning conditions are actually reversed from the initial game description\n\nEither way, my best strategy is to continue the cycle I've been using, which is now paper-scissors-rock.

Let me check their sequence:\nOpponent: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors\n\nThey're repeating a simple scissors-rock-paper sequence. This would mean I've been correctly predicting their moves and choosing the winning option each time according to the traditional rules.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If I played paper against their scissors in round 1, I should have lost according to traditional rules (scissors cuts paper). But the hint message said I won.\n\nLet me double check the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis actually contradicts the traditional rules! In the standard game:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut here, the rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo the rules are definitely different from traditional rock-paper-scissors. I'll continue with this understanding.\n\nFollowing the pattern and the stated rules of this game, I should play scissors next to counter my opponent's likely move of rock.",
