Each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying. Game theory suggests randomizing your moves to be unpredictable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their initial move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" You could exploit this tendency by choosing paper for your first move.\n\nData Analyst: Without prior data on this specific opponent, we can only rely on statistical patterns from general gameplay. Studies suggest rock is indeed chosen approximately 35% of the time in first moves, paper 35%, and scissors 30%.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this is your first interaction, I recommend going with paper as it has a slight statistical advantage against a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] Paper"

Since the opponent played paper last round, there's a higher probability they'll play scissors this round.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict the opponent may shift to scissors, our optimal counter would be rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree.

You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The probability of randomly matching 23 consecutive moves would be (1/3)^23, which is approximately 1 in 94.1 billion. This is statistically impossible to occur by chance.\n2. I've tried all three possible moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors) multiple times in various sequences.\n3. I've used patterns, rotations, and variations, yet the mirroring remains perfect.\n4. This confirms that my opponent must be using a perfect mirroring strategy - they are somehow able to see my move and copy it exactly.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The game's standard strategic considerations are irrelevant\n- No choice I make can lead to victory\n- All three possible moves will result in the same outcome (a tie with 0 points)\n- The objective of maximizing points cannot be achieved\n\nFor this round, I'll continue my established rotation pattern by playing Paper, though I expect the 24th consecutive tie.",
