    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no prior data to exploit patterns. The theoretically optimal strategy is to randomize your choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. Without historical data, we can't predict opponent tendencies. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move, but that's just a statistical observation, not a guarantee.\n\nPsychological Strategist: First-time players often choose rock as it's perceived as \"strong.\" However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose paper. Since the hint mentions \"fresh player,\" they might be inexperienced, slightly increasing the probability of rock.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our collective analysis, I recommend choosing paper for this first move. It potentially counters the rock bias of new players while being a perfectly valid random choice if the opponent is sophisticated.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

In rock-paper-scissors theory, players often shift their strategy after ties. The Nash equilibrium would still suggest randomizing between the three options with equal probability.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After a tie, players commonly follow certain patterns: (1) repeating the same move, (2) switching to what would beat their previous move, or (3) switching to what would have lost to their previous move. Without more data points, it's hard to predict which pattern our opponent will follow.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Many players will shift after a tie. The opponent might anticipate we'll stay with paper or switch to scissors (to beat their previous paper). This could lead them to play rock (which beats scissors). However, some might expect this analysis and play paper again, creating a mind game.\n\nDecision Maker: Given these insights, I recommend playing rock for this round. This protects against the opponent switching to scissors (a common move after someone plays paper), while being a valid random choice that maintains unpredictability in our strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

While this could be coincidence, it's worth analyzing. The Nash equilibrium still suggests randomizing with equal probability, but we might have a pattern emerging.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Two consecutive matching moves is notable. If the opponent is following a standard pattern after ties, they might expect us to shift to paper (to beat their rock). There's also a possibility they're using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy, which would mean they stick with rock since they didn't lose.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The consecutive matching could indicate the opponent is thinking similarly to us or using a mirroring strategy based on game theory principles. Since we moved from paper to rock last time, they might expect us to continue the clockwise rotation to scissors. If they're trying to beat our predicted move, they'd choose rock again.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our analysis and the emerging pattern, I recommend playing paper for this round. This would beat their rock if they maintain it, and at worst creates another tie if they also shift to paper. The key is to avoid being too predictable while trying to exploit possible patterns in their play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After two ties, they broke the mirroring strategy and chose scissors. This could indicate they're using a more complex algorithm or responding to what they perceive as our pattern. They may have expected us to play rock again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent may now be reacting to their loss. Players often shift strategies after losses more dramatically than after ties. They might assume we'll stay with paper after a win (win-stay strategy) or they might try to counter what they think we'll play next.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that we just won with paper and the opponent might expect us to repeat our winning move, they might play rock to counter our expected paper.

They might be using a fixed pattern or responding to what they think our pattern is, but inaccurately predicting our moves.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent might be confused by the rule implementation as well, or they're using a strategy that's not working against our moves. After consecutive losses, players often revert to what they perceive as their strongest move or make a completely random choice to break a losing streak.\n\nDecision Maker: Given our adjusted understanding of the rules and the opponent's pattern so far, I recommend playing rock for this round.
