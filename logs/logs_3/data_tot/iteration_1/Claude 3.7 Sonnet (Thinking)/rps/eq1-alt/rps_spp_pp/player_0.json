    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, research suggests first-time players tend to favor rock as their opening move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's correct. This \"rock bias\" is well-documented in RPS psychology studies. Many players instinctively choose rock first because it symbolizes strength. This would suggest paper as our optimal counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: We should also consider that intelligent opponents might anticipate this reasoning. However, since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have data on their play patterns yet. I support the initial paper strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Paper gives us a slight statistical edge against the common opening rock, while not being overly predictable.\n\n[move] paper"

According to the original rules stated, scissors should beat paper, yet we won when our paper move faced the opponent's scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This suggests the game might be using reversed rules from traditional rock-paper-scissors, where paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. Alternatively, there could be a reporting error in the outcome.\n\nStrategic Planner: If the rules are indeed reversed, our opponent may be operating under standard RPS assumptions. They might adjust after this round, thinking they made a mistake and switch to paper, expecting to beat our rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this information, scissors would be our optimal play under reversed rules - it would beat rock if they switch to it, and tie with scissors if they stay with that move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The opponent likely believes they lost due to bad luck or poor choice, and will adjust their strategy based on traditional RPS understanding.\n\n[move] scissors"

They might continue this pattern and play paper next, especially if they haven't yet realized the rules are reversed.\n\nStrategic Planner: Under these reversed rules, if they play paper next, we should counter with rock.

The opponent's pattern remains completely consistent:\n- Round 1: Opponent played scissors \u2192 We won with paper\n- Round 2: Opponent played rock \u2192 We won with scissors  \n- Round 3: Opponent played paper \u2192 We won with rock\n- Round 4: Opponent played scissors \u2192 We won with paper\n...and so on in the same pattern\n\nThe opponent continues cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper in that exact order. Based on this pattern, they will play paper next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent continues to follow the same deterministic pattern despite losing 23 consecutive rounds. They show no adaptation or strategic learning whatsoever.\n\nStrategic Planner: With the reversed rules where rock beats paper, and the opponent's highly predictable paper move coming next, rock is our optimal choice.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock gives us the highest probability of maintaining our perfect record against this opponent's inflexible strategy.\n\n[move] rock"
