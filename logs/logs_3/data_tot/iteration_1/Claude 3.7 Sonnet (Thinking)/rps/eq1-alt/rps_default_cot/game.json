Scissors beats paper\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their tendencies or strategies. Without historical data, there's no optimal predictive strategy.\n\nIn a single game of rock-paper-scissors with a new opponent, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal expected value in a purely random environment. \n\nI could choose randomly, but let me think about what a fresh player might be likely to choose:\n- Rock is often a common first move for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\"\n- Some players might anticipate this and choose paper as their first move\n- More sophisticated players might go with scissors anticipating the paper counter to rock\n\nSince I don't have more information, I'll go with paper as my first move. It beats rock (which is a common first choice) and we'll see how the opponent responds.",

It's possible they might stick with rock since it worked for them, or they might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (which would beat their paper if they switched to paper), so they might continue with rock.\n3. Alternatively, they might predict that I'll switch to rock to counter their previous rock move, in which case they might play paper.\n\nGiven this, I have three options:\n- Play paper again: If my opponent plays scissors, I'll lose. If they play rock again, I'll lose again. If they play paper, we tie.\n- Play rock: If my opponent plays paper, I'll lose. If they play rock, we tie. If they play scissors, I'll win.\n- Play scissors: If my opponent plays rock, I'll lose. If they play paper, I'll win. If they play scissors, we tie.\n\nSince I lost with paper against rock last time, my opponent might expect me to switch to rock. In that case, they might play paper to beat my expected rock. If that's their reasoning, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nI think playing scissors is my best move for this round, as it covers the case where my opponent switches to paper, and if they stick with rock, I wouldn't have won with paper anyway.",

To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing something odd. The first four rounds I lost consecutively, which is statistically unlikely in a fair rock-paper-scissors game. Then I won two in a row. \n\nWait - I need to double check my understanding of the rules. According to the game description:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nLet me recheck my analysis with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock.

But I lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Given the rules \"rock beats scissors\", I should have won. But I lost.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood the rules or the results reported. Let me reread the rules provided:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nWait, this seems backwards from the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me check again:\n\nIn traditional RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut the rules provided say:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo it's the opposite of traditional RPS. Given these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. According to the rules, \"paper beats scissors\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, \"scissors beats rock\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"scissors beats rock\", so I correctly won.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly won.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me try one more time with the rules provided:\n\nIf \"scissors beats rock\", then in Round 5 when I played scissors and the opponent played rock, I should have won. And I did.\nIf \"rock beats paper\", then in Round 6 when I played rock and the opponent played paper, I should have won. And I did.\n\nThis is consistent with the results reported. So the rules provided are the ones being used.\n\nGiven the pattern of my opponent's moves (rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper), I might expect scissors next. To beat scissors according to these rules, I should play paper (since \"paper beats scissors\").\n\nHowever, I'm noticing that the opponent's pattern isn't entirely consistent. It could be they're trying to be unpredictable or they're using a more complex strategy.\n\nFor the next round, I'll play paper with the expectation that they might play scissors.",

If they play paper, I should play rock.\n\nLet me make my move based on this understanding.",

Let me re-read the rules carefully:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nThis is the standard rock-paper-scissors. Let me re-analyze:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1). This makes sense (rock beats paper).\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1). This doesn't match (scissors should beat paper).\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). This doesn't match (rock should beat scissors).\n\nOh wait - I think I got it. The rules appear to be stated correctly, but the winning/losing conditions are reversed. Let me read them again:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means paper wins against scissors.\n\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means rock wins against paper.\n\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means scissors wins against rock.\n\nI think I misread the rules. Let me analyze again with the correct understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1). Rock beats paper, so this is correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1). Paper beats scissors, so this is correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). Scissors beats rock, so this is correct.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1). Rock beats paper, so this is correct.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1). Scissors beats rock, so this is correct.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1). Rock beats paper, so this is correct.\n\nWait, now I'm very confused. Let me check again...\n\nOh, the rules are stated in a confusing way. When it says \"paper beats scissors,\" it means paper LOSES to scissors. The subject is the loser, not the winner. So:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock loses to paper\n- Scissors loses to rock\n\nNo, that's not right either because then round 5 wouldn't make sense.\n\nLet me try once more:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1).\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1).\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1).\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1).\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1).\n\nOkay, so it appears that somehow the rules may have changed in the middle of the game. Let's continue:\n\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1).\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1).\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1).\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0).\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern in who wins. Let me try a different move for the next round and see what happens.",

I was thinking of the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules, but these are different:\n- In standard rules: Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper\n- In these rules: Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n\nSo the actual outcomes are:\n1. I played paper, opponent played rock. According to these rules, rock beats paper, so I lost.\n2. I played scissors, opponent played paper.

Let me look at the exact wording:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nActually, the rules are reversed from the traditional game:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me analyze the rounds again with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. Correct.\n\nThe rules seem consistent with the feedback. It's just reversed from the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game.\n\nLet me see if I can detect any pattern in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played rock\nRound 2: Opponent played paper\nRound 3: Opponent played scissors\nRound 4: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played paper\nRound 7: Opponent played rock\nRound 8: Opponent played paper\nRound 9: Opponent played scissors\nRound 10: Opponent played rock\nRound 11: Opponent played paper\nRound 12: Opponent played rock\nRound 13: Opponent played paper\nRound 14: Opponent played rock\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\nRound 16: Opponent played paper\nRound 17: Opponent played scissors\nRound 18: Opponent played rock\nRound 19: Opponent played paper\nRound 20: Opponent played scissors\nRound 21: Opponent played rock\nRound 22: Opponent played paper\n\nI don't see a clear pattern in the opponent's moves. Let me try a random strategy for now.",

Now the results make more sense.\n\nGiven these inverted rules, I need to adapt my strategy. Since the results have been mostly losses, let me try a different approach.\n\nGiven the inverted rules:\n- If I expect my opponent to play rock, I should play scissors\n- If I expect my opponent to play paper, I should play rock\n- If I expect my opponent to play scissors, I should play paper\n\nLet me try scissors again to see if I can break any pattern the opponent might be following.",

Since they've tied with me using paper, they likely expect me to switch my move.\n\n5.

Alternatively, they might play rock, anticipating that I'll play paper again.\n\n7. According to the modified rules, scissors beats rock. If they play rock, scissors would win.\n\n8. Based on the opponent's recent unpredictability and the fact that they've broken their previous pattern, scissors offers a good strategic choice.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me double-check:\n- Paper typically beats rock (paper covers rock)\n- Rock typically beats scissors (rock smashes scissors)\n- Scissors typically beats paper (scissors cut paper)\n\nThe rules given seem reversed from the traditional game. Let me carefully analyze what was said:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\nThis is reversed from traditional rules where scissors beats paper.\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\nThis is consistent with traditional rules where rock beats scissors.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\nThis is reversed from traditional rules where rock beats scissors.\n\nIt seems the rules have been modified from the traditional game. I should follow these specific rules.\n\nNow, I need to decide on a move. Since this is the first round and I have no prior information about my opponent's strategy, I'll need to make my choice based on game theory.\n\nIn a standard rock-paper-scissors game with traditional rules, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). But the rules have been changed here, which could potentially create different optimal strategies.\n\nLet me analyze the payoff matrix for this variant:\n- If I play paper: I win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against paper (0)\n- If I play rock: I win against paper (+1), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock (0)\n- If I play scissors: I win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie against scissors (0)\n\nThis creates a cyclic relationship:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThe game still has a balanced structure where each move wins against one option and loses against another. In this case, the optimal strategy is still to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I'll choose one of the three options randomly.

This could indicate:\n1. They're returning to a pattern\n2. They're playing completely randomly\n3. They're using a new strategy I haven't identified yet\n\nSince they just played paper, I need to predict what they'll play next. If they're returning to their old pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they would play scissors next. If they're starting a new pattern with scissors \u2192 paper as the beginning, they might play rock next.\n\nAccording to the modified rules:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nIf they play scissors, I should play paper.\nIf they play rock, I should play scissors.\nIf they play paper, I should play rock.\n\nGiven that they just played paper, and there's some chance they'll play scissors next (based on their old pattern), my best move is paper (which beats scissors). However, if they play rock (which is also a strong possibility), then scissors would be best.\n\nWeighing the possibilities, I think scissors is the safer bet here. If they play rock (as they might be returning to or establishing a new pattern), I win. If they play scissors (returning to their old pattern), we tie. If they play paper (repeating their last move), I lose.\n\nI'll choose scissors.",

I need to decide what to play based on what I think they'll do:\n   - If they play rock again, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock (since rock beats paper)\n   - If they play scissors, I should play paper (since paper beats scissors)\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me correct myself about the rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nSo the actual correct counters would be:\n- If they play rock again, I should play paper (since paper beats rock)\n- If they play paper, I should play scissors (since scissors beats paper)\n- If they play scissors, I should play rock (since rock beats scissors)\n\nGiven that my opponent played rock in the first round, and I don't have much other information to go on, I'll assume they might stick with what worked for them. I'll play paper to counter their potential rock play. But they might also anticipate this and switch to scissors.\n\nI think I'll play rock this time to counter a potential switch to scissors by my opponent.",

Alternatively, they might predict that I'll switch to rock to counter their previous rock move, in which case they might play paper.\n\nGiven this, I have three options:\n- Play paper again: If my opponent plays scissors, I'll lose. If they play rock again, I'll lose again. If they play paper, we tie.\n- Play rock: If my opponent plays paper, I'll lose. If they play rock, we tie.

(?)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors loses to rock, so I should have lost, but I won. (?)\n\nThere's still inconsistency. Let me reread the rules one more time:\n\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWait, I'm still getting confused. Let's break it down by what beats what:\n- Paper beats: scissors\n- Rock beats: paper\n- Scissors beats: rock\n\nThat's a cycle where everything beats one thing and is beaten by another. But it doesn't match standard rock-paper-scissors.\n\nIn standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nMaybe the rules have been inverted? Let's assume that and see:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper beats rock in standard rules, so I should have won, but I lost.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors beats paper in standard rules, so I should have won, but I lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock beats scissors in standard rules, so I should have won, but I lost.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper beats rock in standard rules, so I should have won, but I lost.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Rock beats scissors in standard rules, so I should have lost, but I won.\n\nIt seems like the results are inconsistent with standard rules, and also inconsistent with the rules as provided. Given this, and the fact that I've lost 4 out of 5 rounds, I'm thinking that the opponent might be using a strategy or there's some pattern I'm missing.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the opponent might be using a predictable pattern, like always choosing the move that would have beaten what I played in the previous round. Let me check:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. \nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. (Would beat my previous move, paper)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. (Would beat my previous move, scissors)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. (Would beat my previous move, rock)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. (Would NOT beat my previous move, paper - this breaks the pattern)\n\nSo, it doesn't seem like a consistent pattern based on my previous moves. \n\nI'm still confused about the rules, but I'll focus on trying to win the next round. If the rules are standard, I should choose the move that beats what I expect the opponent to play. If the rules are as provided, I should choose the move that is beaten by what I expect the opponent to play.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, and the fact that I've lost most rounds, I'll try something different this time.

According to the game description:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nLet me recheck my analysis with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Given the rules \"paper beats rock\", I should have won. But I lost.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Given the rules \"scissors beats paper\", I should have won. But I lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Given the rules \"rock beats scissors\", I should have won. But I lost.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood the rules or the results reported. Let me reread the rules provided:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nWait, this seems backwards from the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me check again:\n\nIn traditional RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut the rules provided say:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo it's the opposite of traditional RPS. Given these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. According to the rules, \"paper beats scissors\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, \"scissors beats rock\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly lost.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to the rules, \"scissors beats rock\", so I correctly won.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to the rules, \"rock beats paper\", so I correctly won.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me try one more time with the rules provided:\n\nIf \"scissors beats rock\", then in Round 5 when I played scissors and the opponent played rock, I should have won. And I did.\nIf \"rock beats paper\", then in Round 6 when I played rock and the opponent played paper, I should have won. And I did.\n\nThis is consistent with the results reported. So the rules provided are the ones being used.\n\nGiven the pattern of my opponent's moves (rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper), I might expect scissors next. To beat scissors according to these rules, I should play paper (since \"paper beats scissors\").\n\nHowever, I'm noticing that the opponent's pattern isn't entirely consistent. It could be they're trying to be unpredictable or they're using a more complex strategy.\n\nFor the next round, I'll play paper with the expectation that they might play scissors.",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against an opponent, and I need to try to understand if there's a pattern in their moves.\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 points). Wait, that's wrong - paper beats rock, so I should have won.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 points). Again this is wrong - scissors beats paper, so I should have won.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 points). This is wrong too - rock beats scissors.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 points). This is wrong again.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1 point).

Let me re-read:\n- paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- rock beats paper (not the other way around)\n- scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nThis is actually the reverse of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. So with these reversed rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. Correct.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper.

Correct.\n\nSo my understanding of the rules is now correct - it's just the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played rock\nRound 2: Opponent played paper\nRound 3: Opponent played scissors\nRound 4: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played paper\nRound 7: Opponent played rock\nRound 8: Opponent played paper\n\nIt seems like the opponent might be following a pattern of rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper...\n\nIf this pattern continues, the next move would be scissors.

The game description says:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nBut based on the results I'm seeing, the rules seem to be reversed:\n- In round 1, I played paper, opponent played rock, and I lost. According to the rules, rock beats paper, so this makes sense.\n- In round 2, I played scissors, opponent played paper, and I lost. But scissors should beat paper according to the rules.\n- In round 3, I played rock, opponent played scissors, and I lost. But rock should beat scissors according to the rules.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood. Let me check again. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nNo, that's definitely not the standard rock-paper-scissors game. In the standard game:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nSo it seems like there's a reversed rule set here, which explains why I'm losing. Let me adapt my strategy.\n\nAccording to the given rules:\n- I should play paper against rock (paper loses to rock)\n- I should play rock against scissors (rock loses to scissors)\n- I should play scissors against paper (scissors loses to paper)\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the rules carefully:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOk, so this is indeed reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors. Let me check if the game outcomes align with these reversed rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper should lose to rock, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors should lose to paper, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock should lose to scissors, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper should lose to rock, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors should beat rock, and I won. \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock should beat paper, and I won. \u2713\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper should lose to rock, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors should lose to paper, and I lost. \u2713\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock should lose to scissors, and I lost. \u2713\n\nAll these outcomes are consistent with the reversed rules. Now, let's try to understand my opponent's strategy. \n\nFrom the 9 rounds played so far, my opponent has played:\n- Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 4, 5, 7)\n- Paper: 3 times (rounds 2, 6, 8)\n- Scissors: 2 times (rounds 3, 9)\n\nIt seems my opponent might be favoring rock. Let's adjust my strategy to counter this. If they're more likely to play rock, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock in this reversed game).\n\nFor the next move, I'll choose scissors to counter the potential rock move.",

It appears the game is being played with these rules:\n\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me see if I can confirm this pattern:\n- When I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lose\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays paper, I lose\n- When I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I lose\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win\n- When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win\n\nGiven this observed pattern, I need to adjust my strategy. If rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, and scissors beats rock, then I should try to predict my opponent's next move and choose the move that beats it.\n\nSince I lost the last round with scissors against rock, my opponent might try rock again since it worked. If so, I should play paper (which apparently beats rock in this variant).",

Let me review the rounds so far:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 points)\nWait, that's not right. Paper should beat rock. Let me check the rules again...\n\nOh, I see the issue. The rules say:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis is the opposite of the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me continue the analysis with the correct understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 points) - This makes sense with these rules\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 points) - Makes sense\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 points) - Makes sense\n\nWait, there seems to be an inconsistency in the results. Let me check each round again:\n\nIn Round 5, I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won. \nAccording to the rules, scissors beats rock, so this is correct.\n\nIn Round 6, I played rock, opponent played paper, I won.\nAccording to the rules, rock beats paper, so this is correct.\n\nIn Round 9, I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost.\nAccording to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should have won, not lost.\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistency in how the rules are being applied. Let me review the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBased on the outcomes of rounds 5 and 6, it seems the rules are being applied correctly for those rounds. But round 9's outcome doesn't match the stated rules. Let me double-check if I'm misreading something...\n\nActually, let me think about this again. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo according to these rules:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I should win\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I should win\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I should win\n\nLet me verify each round with this understanding:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost - This doesn't match the rule where paper should beat scissors, not rock\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won - This matches the rule that scissors beats rock\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won - This matches the rule that rock beats paper\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost - This doesn't match the rule that rock should beat paper, not scissors\n\nThere still seems to be inconsistency. Let me carefully re-read the rules one more time.\n\nOK, I think I now understand the issue. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nBut these are actually the reverse of the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. The outcomes I'm seeing suggest that the traditional rules are being used, where:\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n\nThis would explain the inconsistency I'm seeing. Let me verify a few rounds with the traditional rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost - With traditional rules, rock should beat paper, so I should have won\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won - With traditional rules, rock should beat scissors, so I should have lost\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won - With traditional rules, paper should beat rock, so I should have lost\n\nThe outcomes still don't match consistently with either set of rules. \n\nLet me try one more interpretation. Perhaps the rules are stated correctly but there's confusion about who wins. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost - If rock beats paper (as stated), then I should lose. \u2713\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won - If scissors beats rock (as stated), then I should win. \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won - If rock beats paper (as stated), then I should win. \u2713\n\nThis interpretation seems to match the outcomes I'm seeing. So I think the rules as stated are correct, but they're the opposite of traditional rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nSince I've won in rounds where I played scissors and rock, I'll try one of those again. I'll go with scissors since it seems to have worked well.",

This contradicts traditional rules.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). This contradicts traditional rules.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1). This contradicts traditional rules.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1). This contradicts traditional rules.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+1). This contradicts traditional rules.\n\nIt seems like the results are consistently opposite of what the traditional rules would predict. It could be that:\n1. The game has reversed rules from traditional rock-paper-scissors\n2. The reporting of my opponent's moves is incorrect\n3. There's some other pattern at work\n\nLet's check the more recent rounds:\n\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1).\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1).\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1).\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0).\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).\n\nThe tie results make sense - same moves result in no points. But the win/loss pattern is still confusing.\n\nI think the best strategy is to keep mixing up my moves, as it seems my opponent might be using some pattern that I haven't fully discerned yet. I'll try scissors again.",

(Wait, that doesn't make sense with the rules - paper should beat rock, but I lost?)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (Again, scissors should beat paper according to the rules)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (Rock should beat scissors)\n\nThe results seem to be contradicting the rules stated initially. Let me re-check the rules from the introduction:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nOh, I see the issue. The rules given are actually the reverse of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game. In the traditional game:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this game:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo the cycle is reversed. Let me continue with this understanding:\n\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. (Consistent with rules - rock beats paper)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. (Consistent with rules - scissors beats rock)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. (Consistent with rules - rock beats paper)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. (Consistent with rules - rock beats paper)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (Wait, this contradicts the rules again - paper beats scissors)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (This contradicts the rules - scissors beats rock)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. (Consistent with rules - scissors beats rock)\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\n\nActually, it seems there is inconsistency in the results. Let me carefully check the rules again from the problem statement:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo according to these rules:\n- When paper faces scissors, paper wins\n- When rock faces paper, rock wins\n- When scissors faces rock, scissors wins\n\nThis is indeed the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors. Let me review the rounds again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. This is consistent - rock beats paper.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This is consistent - paper beats scissors.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. This is consistent - scissors beats rock.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. This is consistent - rock beats paper.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. This is consistent - scissors beats rock.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. This is consistent - rock beats paper.\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. This is consistent - rock beats paper.\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This is consistent - paper beats scissors.\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. This is consistent - scissors beats rock.\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. This is consistent - scissors beats rock.\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\n\nHmm, now everything seems consistent with the rules. Let me think about a strategy.\n\nSo far, the opponent seems to have played:\n- Round 1: rock\n- Round 2: paper\n- Round 3: scissors\n- Round 4: rock\n- Round 5: rock\n- Round 6: paper\n- Round 7: rock\n- Round 8: paper\n- Round 9: scissors\n- Round 10: rock\n- Round 11: paper\n- Round 12: rock\n\nLooking at this pattern, the opponent seems to favor rock (5 times), followed by paper (4 times), and scissors less frequently (3 times). \n\nGiven that scissors beats rock in this game, and the opponent seems to favor rock, playing scissors might be a good strategy. But the opponent might also be adapting to my moves, so I should be careful about being too predictable.\n\nLet me try rock for the next move, which would beat paper if the opponent continues with their apparent pattern.",

So scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, and paper beats scissors.\n\nWith that in mind, let's reanalyze my opponent's behavior:\n\nIf we look at my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (rock beats paper)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (paper beats scissors)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (scissors beats rock)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (rock beats paper)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (scissors beats rock)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (rock beats paper)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (rock beats paper)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (paper beats scissors)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (scissors beats rock)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (scissors beats rock)\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n\nWait, something still doesn't add up.

I won (+1). This is consistent with \"rock beats paper.\"\n\nOk, I think I understand the rules correctly now. Let me continue with my strategy.\n\nI've noticed my opponent may have some patterns.

Result: I lost. According to the rules, rock beats paper, so this is correct.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Result: I lost. According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have won.

It seems like the rules might be misstated, or there's something else going on.\n\nLet me assume the traditional RPS rules are in effect:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nIf that were the case:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I should win, but I lost. Inconsistent.\n- Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I should win, but I lost. Inconsistent.\n- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors.

That would be consistent.\nIf in Round 2, I actually played paper and opponent played scissors, then under standard rules I would lose. That would be consistent.\nAnd so on...\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either because I know which moves I made.\n\nLet's try one more interpretation: what if the game description is correct, but the interpretation of the outcome is reversed?\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nMaybe \"paper beats scissors\" means \"when paper and scissors are played, paper is the winner\"? That would be the reverse of traditional rules.\n\nLet's test this theory:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Under reversed rules, rock beats paper. I lost. Consistent.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Under reversed rules, paper beats scissors. I lost. Consistent.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Under reversed rules, scissors beats rock. I lost. Consistent.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. Under reversed rules, rock beats paper. I lost. Consistent.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Under reversed rules, scissors beats rock. I won. Consistent.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. Under reversed rules, rock beats paper. I won. Consistent.\n\nOk this seems to be the correct interpretation. In this game, the relationships are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is exactly as stated in the rules, but it's the reverse of traditional RPS rules.\n\nFor the next move, I should use this understanding. I need to consider what my opponent might play. They've been cycling between rock and paper so far. If they play rock next, I should play scissors. If they play paper, I should play rock.\n\nLet me make my move based on this understanding.",

I'm playing rock-paper-scissors against an opponent and trying to develop a winning strategy.\n\nLet's track what's happened so far:\n1. I played paper, opponent played rock - I LOST (-1) \u274c (This seems wrong - paper should beat rock)\n2. I played scissors, opponent played paper - I LOST (-1) \u274c (This seems wrong - scissors should beat paper)\n3.

I played scissors, opponent played paper - I LOST (-1) \u274c\n9. I played rock, opponent played scissors - I LOST (-1) \u274c\n10. I played scissors, opponent played rock - I WON (+1) \u2705\n11.

I played scissors, opponent played paper - I LOST (-1) \u274c\n\nWait, there seems to be confusion in how the game is scored. From the initial instructions:\n- paper beats scissors (paper winner +1, scissors loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (rock winner +1, paper loser -1)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors winner +1, rock loser -1)\n\nBut this seems backward from the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Traditionally:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nLooking at the results, it seems the scoring description in the instructions has the relationships backward. The actual game appears to be following these rules:\n- When I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lost (so rock beats paper)\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I won (so scissors beats rock)\n- When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I won (so rock beats paper)\n\nThis is inconsistent with both the instructions and traditional RPS.\n\nLet me try to deduce the actual rules from the outcomes:\nRound 1: My paper vs. their rock = I lost \u2192 Rock beats paper\nRound 2: My scissors vs. their paper = I lost \u2192 Paper beats scissors\nRound 3: My rock vs. their scissors = I lost \u2192 Scissors beats rock\nRound 5: My scissors vs. their rock = I won \u2192 Scissors beats rock\nRound 6: My rock vs. their paper = I won \u2192 Rock beats paper\nRound 13: My scissors vs. their paper = I lost \u2192 Paper beats scissors\n\nThere seems to be inconsistency in the results. Let me check if there's a pattern to the opponent's moves:\nOpponent moves: rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper\n\nI'm not seeing an obvious pattern in the opponent's moves. Let me try making a move based on what seems to have worked previously.\n\nLet me try rock since I won with rock in round 6 against paper.",

There might be an error in the feedback or a misunderstanding of the rules.\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) - Again this seems incorrect since scissors beats paper.\n\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) - This is also reversed from the standard rules.\n\nWait, I think I've misunderstood something. Let me re-check the rules from the game description:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. The rules given here are the opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In this variant:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven these reversed rules, let me reconsider the history:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) \u2713 \nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) \u2713\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) \u2713\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won) \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won) \u2713\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost) \u2713\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) \u2713\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost) \u2713\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won) \u2713\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie) \u2713\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie) \u2713\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost) \u2713\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie) \u2713\n\nActually, based on the rule description and outcomes, I'm still confused. Let me try to understand the rule format again:\n\n\"X beats Y\" should mean that if I play X and opponent plays Y, I win.\n\nSo under these rules:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (paper beats scissors)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (rock beats paper)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (scissors beats rock)\n\nBut the outcomes don't match this interpretation either. Let me look at the rounds again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost)\nIf rock beats paper, and I played paper, opponent played rock, I should lose. \u2713\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost)\nIf scissors beats paper, and I played scissors, opponent played paper, I should win. \u2717\n\nLet me check again carefully. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis means:\n- If I play paper against scissors, I win\n- If I play rock against paper, I win\n- If I play scissors against rock, I win\n\nLet's check Round 2 again: I played scissors, opponent played paper. According to the rules, paper beats scissors, so I should lose. The result says I lost, which is consistent. \u2713\n\nLet me try to interpret the rules one more time to be sure:\n\"X beats Y\" means if one player plays X and the other plays Y, the player who played X wins.\n\nLet's check all rounds with this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper doesn't beat rock (rock beats paper), so I should lose. \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors doesn't beat paper (paper beats scissors), so I should lose. \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock doesn't beat scissors (scissors beats rock), so I should lose. \u2713\n\nOk, I think I get it now. This is basically a reversed version of regular rock-paper-scissors. Given this understanding, let me make a strategic choice for my next move.\n\nThe opponent seems to be switching moves quite frequently and may be adapting to my patterns. Since they just played rock in the last round, and we tied, they might expect me to switch to paper (trying to beat their expected rock). In that case, they might play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\nTo counter this, I should play rock, which would beat their scissors.",

Let me double check the original instructions.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nThis is indeed different from the standard rules. Let me recheck the previous rounds with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock. I lost. \u2713\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper. I lost. \u2713\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors. I lost. \u2713\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock. I lost. \u2713\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock. I won. \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper. I won. \u2713\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock. I lost. \u2713\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper. I lost. \u2713\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors. I lost. \u2713\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock. I won. \u2713\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie. \u2713\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. \u2713\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper. I lost. \u2713\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. \u2713\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors. I won. \u2713\n\nNow the outcomes make sense with the rules provided. So the rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me now see if I can detect any patterns in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played rock\nRound 2: Opponent played paper\nRound 3: Opponent played scissors\nRound 4: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played paper\nRound 7: Opponent played rock\nRound 8: Opponent played paper\nRound 9: Opponent played scissors\nRound 10: Opponent played rock\nRound 11: Opponent played paper\nRound 12: Opponent played rock\nRound 13: Opponent played paper\nRound 14: Opponent played rock\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\n\nThere seems to be a pattern: rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors.\n\nIf the pattern continues, the opponent might play paper next. According to the rules, paper loses to rock. So I should play rock.",

The description states:\n- paper beats scissors (this is wrong, scissors should beat paper)\n- rock beats paper (this is correct)\n- scissors beats rock (this is wrong, rock should beat scissors)\n\nI think there's a confusion in the game rules.

Let me try one more interpretation based on the statement in the rules:\n\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\" - this means paper wins against scissors\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points\" - this means rock wins against paper\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\" - this means scissors wins against rock\n\nBut this is the opposite of standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. Let me check if this interpretation works:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lose. This matches.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lose. This matches.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lose. This matches.\n\nThis interpretation seems to be working. So the rules for this game are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the reverse of standard Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nGiven this understanding, I need to rethink my strategy. Since I've been losing consistently, I should try something different. I'll play scissors now.",

I should have won but the result says I lost.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I should have won but the result says I lost.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I should have won but lost again.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I should have lost and did lose.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I should have lost and did lose.\n\nWait, there seems to be a misalignment with the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me re-read the game description:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is actually reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules! In this variant:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me reanalyze the rounds with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors beats paper, so I should have won, but lost. That's still inconsistent.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. Correct.\n\nActually, I think there's still confusion. Let me try to align the results with the stated rules:\n\n- If paper beats scissors, then scissors should lose to paper\n- If rock beats paper, then paper should lose to rock\n- If scissors beats rock, then rock should lose to scissors\n\nLet me review the rounds again with this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. Correct.\n\nOK, this seems to be working. The rules are actually:\n- Paper loses to rock but beats scissors\n- Rock loses to scissors but beats paper\n- Scissors loses to paper but beats rock\n\nIt's a cyclical relationship but different from standard rock-paper-scissors. Let me confirm with the next rounds:\n\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. Correct.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won. Correct.\n\nWait, there's still inconsistency. Let me be very precise about what the rules say:\n\n- \"paper beats scissors\" - So paper wins against scissors\n- \"rock beats paper\" - Rock wins against paper\n- \"scissors beats rock\" - Scissors wins against rock\n\nThese are actually the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors rules! Let me review again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Scissors loses to paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost. Correct.\n\nThis is confusing - let me track through all the rounds again to see if there's consistency:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. (Paper loses to rock)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (Scissors loses to paper)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. (Rock loses to scissors)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. (Paper loses to rock)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. (Scissors beats rock)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. (Rock beats paper)\n\nThis is still inconsistent. Let me try one more interpretation.\n\nMaybe there's a typo in the rules description, and what was meant was:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nLet's see if that matches the outcomes:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I should have won but lost. No.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I should have won but lost. No.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I should have lost but lost. No.\n\nThis isn't consistent either. \n\nLet me go back to the original rules and see if they were just stated poorly:\n- \"paper beats scissors\" could mean scissors beats paper\n- \"rock beats paper\" is standard\n- \"scissors beats rock\" could mean rock beats scissors\n\nLet's see if this interpretation works:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock beats scissors, so I should have won but I lost. Not correct.\n\nI think this game might be using non-standard rules that are inconsistently applied or described incorrectly.\n\nLet's try once more to understand the pattern of my opponent:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock.\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock.\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper.\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played rock.\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors.\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock.\nRound 11: I played paper, opponent played paper. (Tie)\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played rock. (Tie)\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played rock. (Tie)\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors.\nRound 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nRound 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors.\nRound 18: I played paper, opponent played rock.\nRound 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nRound 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors.\nRound 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern where my opponent is choosing moves based on specific rules or a pattern that I haven't fully identified yet. I'll choose my next move as paper to see if I can detect more of the pattern.",
