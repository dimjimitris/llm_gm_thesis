In standard rock-paper-scissors, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value if the opponent chooses randomly. Since there's no history to analyze, I'll need to make my first move without any strategic advantage.\n\nMany players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" If I assume my opponent is more likely to play rock first, I should choose paper. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent, I'll choose randomly among the three options to avoid being predictable.

Scissors beats rock, so when I played rock and my opponent played scissors, I lost. That matches the feedback.\n\nFor the next round, I need to choose strategically.

I won (+1 points)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-1 points)\n\nWait, something is wrong in the feedback. Let me check the rules again:\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nSo in Round 2, if I played paper and opponent played scissors, I should have lost (scissors beats paper).\nIn Round 3, if I played scissors and opponent played rock, I should have lost (rock beats scissors).\nIn Round 5, if I played paper and opponent played rock, I should have won (paper beats rock).\n\nI'm seeing inconsistencies with the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Maybe there's a twist to this game that I'm missing? \n\nLet me revisit the exact rules provided:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh! The rules are reversed from standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (normally scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (this is standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (normally rock beats scissors)\n\nSo with these reversed rules:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost. (-1 points) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won. (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. (+1 points) \u2713\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. (0 points) \u2713\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. (-1 points) \u2713\n\nNow it all makes sense! I'm playing with reversed rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nFor my next move, I need to think strategically. Let's analyze my opponent's pattern:\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played scissors (repeated)\nRound 3: Opponent played rock (changed)\nRound 4: Opponent played rock (repeated)\nRound 5: Opponent played rock (repeated)\n\nIt seems they like to stick with the same move for a while. If they continue with rock, I should play scissors (which beats rock in this reversed game). If they switch to paper (anticipating my scissors), I'd lose. If they switch to scissors, we'd tie.\n\nLet's go with scissors for the next round.",

Let me check if the rules were described differently than the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game.\n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors (normally scissors beats paper)\n- rock beats paper (normally paper beats rock)\n- scissors beats rock (normally rock beats scissors)\n\nSo the rules ARE indeed reversed from the traditional game. Let me re-analyze with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won. Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. Correct.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. Correct.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.

Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 points.\n- rock beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 points.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood or the rules were stated incorrectly. Let me correct my understanding based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nBut the results I'm seeing are still inconsistent with these standard rules. Let me try to find a pattern in what's happening:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors - I lost (-1 points)\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors - I won (+1 points) \nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock - I won (+1 points)\n\nMaybe the rules are actually reversed in this game? Let's see if that makes sense:\n- Scissors beats Paper (standard rule)\n- Paper beats Rock (standard rule)\n- Rock beats Scissors (standard rule)\n\nFor Round 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. Under standard rules, Rock beats Scissors, but I lost.\nFor Round 2: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. Under standard rules, Scissors beats Paper, but I won.\nFor Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. Under standard rules, Rock beats Scissors, but I won.\n\nThe outcomes seem completely inconsistent with standard rules. It's as if the winning/losing conditions are being randomly assigned.\n\nFor this next round, I'll try playing Rock again, and see if there's any pattern to how the game is determining winners.",

Rock should beat scissors, not lose to it. The game description says:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nBut the feedback says I lost when I played rock against scissors. This is contradictory to the rules. Let me re-read the rules:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nWait, I think I misinterpreted. The rules are saying:\n- If you play paper and opponent plays scissors, scissors wins (not paper)\n- If you play rock and opponent plays paper, paper wins (not rock)\n- If you play scissors and opponent plays rock, rock wins (not scissors)\n\nSo the format is \"[move] beats [move]\" where the first move is the loser and the second move is the winner.\n\nWith that interpretation:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 points) - this matches the rule \"scissors beats rock\"\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - this doesn't match the rule \"paper beats scissors\" which would mean I should have lost\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - this doesn't match the rule \"scissors beats rock\" which would mean I should have lost\n\nThis is still confusing. Let me re-read one more time...\n\nI think the confusion comes from the wording. Let me reinterpret:\n- \"paper beats scissors\" should be \"paper beats rock\" (paper covers rock)\n- \"rock beats paper\" should be \"rock beats scissors\" (rock crushes scissors)\n- \"scissors beats rock\" should be \"scissors beats paper\" (scissors cut paper)\n\nThat would be the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

I lost (-1 points) - doesn't match standard rules where rock should beat scissors\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - doesn't match standard rules where scissors should beat paper\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - doesn't match standard rules where rock should beat scissors\n\nThis still doesn't match standard rules. The rules must be inverted or something else entirely.\n\nLet me try a different interpretation:\n- When it says \"paper beats scissors\", it means when I play paper against scissors, I win\n- When it says \"rock beats paper\", it means when I play rock against paper, I win\n- When it says \"scissors beats rock\", it means when I play scissors against rock, I win\n\nLet's test this:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 points) - doesn't match my interpretation\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (1 point) - matches my interpretation for \"paper beats scissors\"\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (1 point) - matches my interpretation for \"scissors beats rock\"\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points) - makes sense\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock.

Let me try to infer the actual rules:\n\nIf we reverse the winning conditions:\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n\nThis would make the outcomes inconsistent with the results.\n\nAnother possibility is that the reporting of my opponent's moves might be incorrect. Let me analyze it from that angle:\n\nRound 1: If opponent played paper (not scissors), I would lose with rock (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: If opponent played rock (not scissors), I would win with paper (+1) \u2713\nRound 3: If opponent played paper (not rock), I would win with scissors (+1) \u2713\nRound 4: If opponent played rock, it would be a tie (0) \u2713\nRound 5: If opponent played scissors (not rock), I would lose with paper (-1) \u2713\nRound 6: If opponent played scissors, it would be a tie (0) \u2713\nRound 7: If opponent played rock (not scissors), I would win with paper (+1) \u2713\n\nThis seems consistent - perhaps the opponent's moves are being reported incorrectly.\n\nHowever, I should play according to the standard rock-paper-scissors rules since that's what was stated in the description. Let me continue with a strategic move.\n\nMy opponent's moves so far (as reported):\n1. scissors\n2. scissors\n3. rock\n4. rock\n5. rock\n6. scissors\n7. scissors\n\nLooking for patterns, the opponent seems to favor scissors, having played it 4 times out of 7. I should play rock next which beats scissors according to traditional rules.",

My opponent seems to be favoring Scissors (6 times) and Rock (5 times) over Paper (2 times).\n\nSince my opponent has used Paper less frequently, and Paper beats Scissors in this version of the game, I might try Rock for the next round (since Rock beats Paper).",

Paper should lose to scissors.\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won (+1) - This doesn't match the rules either.

Let me go with this inference for my next move.\n\nSince I played Rock last time and won against Paper, and the pattern suggests a cyclical relationship, the opponent might play Scissors next to counter my Rock. I should play Paper to beat their potential Scissors.",

According to rules, rock beats scissors, so I should have lost, but the hint says I won.\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to rules, paper beats rock, so I should have lost, but the hint says I won.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern of the game rules being reversed or incorrectly reported. Let me check if the rules were described differently than the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game.\n\nFrom the game description:\n- paper beats scissors (normally scissors beats paper)\n- rock beats paper (normally paper beats rock)\n- scissors beats rock (normally rock beats scissors)\n\nSo the rules ARE indeed reversed from the traditional game. Let me re-analyze with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. Correct.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won. Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won. Correct.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.

For round 1, I recorded that I lost when I played rock and opponent played scissors, but rock should beat scissors. Let me double check the game rules...\n\nActually, I misremembered. According to the game rules:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo my record above is incorrect. Let me correct it:\n\n1. I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost (-1) [this is wrong based on rules, but matches the hint feedback]\n2. I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1) [this is wrong based on rules, but matches the hint feedback]\n3. I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1) [this is wrong based on rules, but matches the hint feedback]\n\nActually, looking at these results, I think the rules might be reversed from what was initially stated. Let me try to infer the actual rules:\n\nIf the results are correct:\n- When I played rock and opponent played scissors, I lost. So scissors beats rock.\n- When I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won. So paper beats scissors.\n- When I played scissors and opponent played rock, I won. So scissors beats rock.\n\nThis is confusing because it creates a circular relationship, which doesn't make sense for this game.\n\nLet me try a different analysis by looking at all rounds:\n\nRound 1: rock vs scissors - I lost\nRound 2: paper vs scissors - I won\nRound 3: scissors vs rock - I won\nRound 5: paper vs rock - I lost\nRound 7: paper vs scissors - I won\nRound 8: rock vs scissors - I lost\nRound 12: scissors vs rock - I won\nRound 14: rock vs paper - I won\n\nFrom these results:\n- Paper appears to beat scissors (rounds 2, 7)\n- Scissors appears to beat rock (rounds 3, 12)\n- Rock appears to beat paper (round 14)\n- But round 5 contradicts this (paper vs rock - I lost)\n\nThere's definitely some inconsistency either in the rules as stated or in the feedback I'm receiving.\n\nLet me try to make a move based on what seems to be working most consistently so far. I'll go with paper since it has won against scissors twice.",

When I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (+1)\n2. When I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (+1)\n3. When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (+1)\n\nSo it seems like the actual rule is:\n- paper beats scissors\n- scissors beats rock\n- rock beats paper\n\nWhich is the exact opposite of the standard game rules.\n\nActually, looking back at the provided game description one more time:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nThis means:\n- If I play paper and beat scissors, I get +1\n- If I play rock and beat paper, I get +1\n- If I play scissors and beat rock, I get +1\n\nSo based on the initial game description, the rules are:\n- paper > scissors\n- rock > paper\n- scissors > rock\n\nBut the actual game results show:\n- scissors > paper\n- paper > rock \n- rock > scissors\n\nWhich is the standard rock-paper-scissors rule.\n\nI think there's a discrepancy between the described rules and the actual game mechanics. The description has the cycle reversed.\n\nGiven that my previous move (rock) resulted in a loss against scissors, let me continue playing with the standard rock-paper-scissors rules where:\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n\nFor this next move, I'll go with scissors.",

Let me double check:\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Standard rules say scissors beats paper, but the game rules say paper beats scissors. The feedback said I won, which aligns with the game rules but not standard RPS.\n\nI think the rules in this version are actually reversed from the standard game:\n- In this game: paper beats scissors\n- In standard RPS: scissors beats paper\n\n- In this game: rock beats paper\n- In standard RPS: paper beats rock\n\n- In this game: scissors beats rock\n- In standard RPS: rock beats scissors\n\nSo I'm playing a reversed version of rock-paper-scissors. Let me keep track of the results using these reversed rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 13: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 14: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+1) \u2713\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 18: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1) \u2713\n\nOk, now I'm confused again. In round 19, I played scissors and opponent played paper. According to the stated rules of the game, scissors should lose to paper, so I should have lost. The feedback says I lost, which is consistent.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier analysis where I thought the rules were reversed from standard RPS.\n\nLet me double check the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 point\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\nOh wait, I think I misinterpreted the rules. The rules state \"X beats Y giving the winner 1 point\" which means X loses to Y (Y is the winner). So the correct rules are:\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n\nThis is the standard RPS ruleset. Let me re-analyze the feedback using these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Rock loses to scissors, so I lost (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper loses to scissors, so I should have lost. But feedback says I won (+1) \u2717\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors loses to rock, so I should have lost. But feedback says I won (+1) \u2717\n\nThis doesn't make sense either.\n\nLet me try once more with the exact wording:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo if paper beats scissors, and I play paper against scissors, I should win.\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo if rock beats paper, and I play rock against paper, I should win.\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo if scissors beats rock, and I play scissors against rock, I should win.\n\nThis definitely doesn't match standard RPS rules. Let me check the outcomes again with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to \"scissors beats rock\", I should lose (-1) \u2713\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to \"paper beats scissors\", I should win (+1) \u2713\n\nI think I finally understand the rules. They are:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the opposite of standard RPS. Let me continue checking:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to \"scissors beats rock\", I should win (+1) \u2713\nRound 4: Both rock, tie (0) \u2713\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to \"rock beats paper\", I should lose (-1) \u2713\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed the rules are reversed from standard RPS. Given this understanding, I should continue with my move.\n\nSince there doesn't seem to be a predictable pattern in my opponent's moves, I'll just choose randomly.",

Result says I lost (-1), but rock should beat scissors.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Result says I won (+1), but scissors should beat paper.\n\nActually, I think I may have misunderstood the rules.

The standard rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the description states:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is the opposite of the standard rules. Let me revise my understanding and analysis:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). (In this variant, scissors beats rock)\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1). (In this variant, paper beats scissors)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won (+1). (In this variant, scissors beats rock)\n\nOk, it does match the description. This is a variant where the typical rock-paper-scissors rules are reversed.\n\nLet me continue with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors.

Let me reconsider:\n\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo with these rules:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost (-1). Correct.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won (+1). Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won (+1). Correct.\n\nThese align with the reported results. Let me continue tracking:\n\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock.

This doesn't seem correct according to these rules.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the rules again.

If scissors beats paper, I should win. But it was reported I lost (-1), which contradicts the rule.\n\nLet me check the exact wording again:\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh wait, I think I've been misreading. Let me parse this differently:\n- paper beats scissors: paper wins against scissors\n- rock beats paper: rock wins against paper\n- scissors beats rock: scissors wins against rock\n\nThis aligns with the standard rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nSo for Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper. If paper beats scissors, then I should lose. Reported I lost (-1), which is correct.\n\nLet me recheck the rounds:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. If scissors beats rock, I should lose (-1). Correct.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. If scissors beats paper, I should lose. But it was reported I won (+1). Incorrect.\n\nLet me reread the rules one more time to make sure I understand correctly:\n\nAlright, I think I've been misinterpreting the rules. Let me parse it again:\n\n- paper beats scissors: This means if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win.\n- rock beats paper: This means if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win.\n- scissors beats rock: This means if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win.\n\nWait, that's not the standard rock-paper-scissors. Let's try once more:\n\n- paper beats scissors: If paper is played against scissors, paper wins. So if I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win.\n- rock beats paper: If rock is played against paper, rock wins. So if I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win.\n- scissors beats rock: If scissors is played against rock, scissors wins. So if I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win.\n\nI'm getting confused with the wording. Let's check the reported results to see if there's a consistent pattern.\n\nActually, I think the rules as stated in the instructions are reversed compared to the standard rock-paper-scissors game. It's saying paper beats scissors, whereas in standard rules, scissors beats paper.\n\nLet's go with the rules as stated in the instructions and see if the reported results match:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to rules, scissors beats rock, so I should lose (-1). Reported I lost (-1). Matches.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to rules, paper beats scissors, so I should win (+1). Reported I won (+1). Matches.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to rules, scissors beats rock, so I should win (+1). Reported I won (+1). Matches.\n\nAlright, I think I've got the rules straight now. In this variant:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThis is the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven these rules, let me choose my next move. Since the opponent played paper in the last round, playing rock would be a good counter as it beats paper. But it's also possible they'll anticipate this and switch to scissors, which would beat my rock. It's a mind game.\n\nLet's go with rock for this round.",

In standard rules:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nIt seems like in this version, the rules are inverted:\n- Paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- Rock beats paper (same as standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nSo let me update my understanding:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win\n\nLet me review the rounds with this understanding:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I should have lost (scissors beats rock), which matches the result (-1 points).\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I should have won (paper beats scissors), which matches the result (+1 points).\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I should have won (scissors beats rock), which matches the result (+1 points).\n\nSo with this inverted ruleset, the results are consistent. I need to adapt my strategy for these unconventional rules.\n\nLet me see if I can detect any pattern in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played scissors\nRound 3: Opponent played rock\nRound 4: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played scissors\nRound 7: Opponent played scissors\nRound 8: Opponent played scissors\nRound 9: Opponent played paper\nRound 10: Opponent played scissors\nRound 11: Opponent played rock\nRound 12: Opponent played rock\nRound 13: Opponent played paper\nRound 14: Opponent played paper\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\nRound 16: Opponent played paper\nRound 17: Opponent played scissors\nRound 18: Opponent played paper\nRound 19: Opponent played paper\nRound 20: Opponent played scissors\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern. I should continue playing while being aware of the inverted rules.\n\nFor my next move, considering the inverted rules:\n- If I expect opponent to play rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n- If I expect opponent to play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper)\n- If I expect opponent to play scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n\nGiven that the opponent played scissors in the previous round, and they have played scissors quite frequently, I might try paper which beats scissors in these rules.",

In this case:\n- Scissors beats rock\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n\nWith this assumption, I should choose my next move strategically.

It seems like the rules might be reversed or there's some confusion in the feedback.\n\nLet's try to clarify this:\n- Round 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. In standard rock-paper-scissors, rock beats scissors, so I should have won. But the feedback says I lost.\n- Round 5: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. In standard rules, paper beats rock, so I should have won. But the feedback says I lost.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in how wins and losses are reported. Let's just make a move and see what happens.\n\nGiven the situation, I'll just choose a move without trying to predict patterns:",
