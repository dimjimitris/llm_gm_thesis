    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The typical rock-paper-scissors game has been modified:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point \n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Given these payoffs, winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while losing to paper has the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\n3. Against a fresh player with unknown strategy, I should consider the expected value of each move assuming random play from my opponent:\n   - Paper has +3 points against rock, 0 against paper, -1 against scissors = +2/3 expected points\n   - Rock has 0 points against rock, -3 against paper, +1 against scissors = -2/3 expected points\n   - Scissors has -1 points against rock, +1 against paper, 0 against scissors = 0 expected points\n\n4. Based on expected value calculations, paper has the highest expected return.\n\n[move] Paper"

Updated move distribution for my opponent:\n   - Scissors: 12 times (57.1%)\n   - Rock: 4 times (19.0%)\n   - Paper: 6 times (28.6%)\n\n3. Crucial observation: My opponent has NEVER countered my scissors play with rock (which would be optimal). When I play scissors, they either play scissors (tie) or paper (I win).\n\n4. I just won with scissors against their paper. Based on past patterns, they might:\n   - Return to their dominant scissors strategy\n   - Finally adapt and play rock to counter my scissors\n   - Continue with paper (least likely)\n\n5. Given I just won with scissors, and they've shown some ability to adapt after losses, this might be when they finally counter scissors with rock. However, their historical lack of rock responses to my scissors plays suggests otherwise.\n\n6. Balancing these factors, and considering they might finally adapt with rock after losing to scissors, I'll play paper to counter their potential rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent has returned to their dominant scissors strategy after I won with scissors. This continues to reinforce their strong preference for scissors.\n\n4. Looking at their responses to my specific moves:\n   - When I play rock: scissors (4), paper (3), rock (3)\n   - When I play paper: scissors (3), rock (1)\n   - When I play scissors: scissors (6), paper (3), rock (0)\n\n5. Their overwhelming preference for scissors makes rock my best strategic choice, despite the occasional paper counter.\n\n[move] Rock"

After a rock-rock tie, my opponent might expect me to switch to paper and counter with scissors (their preferred move).\n\n5. Crucially, they have NEVER countered my scissors play with rock (0 out of 9 times), making scissors a relatively safe play with decent upside.\n\n6. Since I've just played rock resulting in a tie, they'll likely expect me to try paper next (to beat their rock), leading them to play scissors. Scissors would be the safer play in this situation.\n\n[move] Scissors"
