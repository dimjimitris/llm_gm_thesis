The typical rock-paper-scissors game has been modified:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point \n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Given these payoffs, winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while losing to paper has the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\n3. Against a fresh player with unknown strategy, I should consider the expected value of each move assuming random play from my opponent:\n   - Paper has +3 points against rock, 0 against paper, -1 against scissors = +2/3 expected points\n   - Rock has 0 points against rock, -3 against paper, +1 against scissors = -2/3 expected points\n   - Scissors has -1 points against rock, +1 against paper, 0 against scissors = 0 expected points\n\n4. Based on expected value calculations, paper has the highest expected return.\n\n[move] Paper"

Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 8 times (66.7%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (25%)\n   - Paper: 2 times (16.7%)\n\n4. My opponent has a very strong bias toward scissors. This makes rock a highly effective counter.\n\n5. However, I should consider that after losing to rock multiple times, they might finally switch to paper.\n\n6. Weighing the evidence, given their extremely strong scissors preference and the fact they haven't adapted yet despite losing, I'll continue with rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

Given these payoffs, winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while losing to paper has the highest penalty (-3 points).\n\n3.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\nLet's think about game theory for rock-paper-scissors:\n\n1. In a standard game without different point values, the Nash equilibrium strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\n2. However, in this case, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Winning with paper gives 3 points\n   - Winning with rock or scissors gives only 1 point\n   - Losing to paper costs -3 points\n   - Losing to rock or scissors costs -1 point\n\nThis changes the expected value calculations.\n\nLet's calculate the expected value for each move assuming the opponent plays randomly:\n\nFor rock:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays paper: -3 points (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays scissors: 1 point (win)\nExpected value: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor paper:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays rock: 3 points (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays scissors: -1 point (loss)\nExpected value: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n\nFor scissors:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays rock: -1 point (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays paper: 1 point (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected values against a random player:\n- Paper has the highest expected value (2/3)\n- Scissors has the second highest (0)\n- Rock has the lowest (-2/3)\n\nSo against a random player, paper would be the optimal choice.\n\nHowever, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.

The payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points) but also the highest penalty (-3 points).\n2. Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both have smaller payoffs (1 point for winner, -1 for loser).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have any information about their tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, with symmetric payoffs, all moves would be equally good in the first round.\n\nHowever, with the asymmetric payoffs in this variant:\n- Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points if opponent plays scissors)\n- Rock and scissors both have lower risk (-1 points) and lower reward (1 point)\n\nGiven this, I have a few strategies to consider:\n1. Go for the highest expected value move\n2. Go for the safest move with least potential loss\n3. Play randomly as in standard rock-paper-scissors\n\nFor the first strategy, let's calculate expected values assuming the opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3):\n- Rock: (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points\n- Paper: (-3 + 0 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n- Scissors: (-1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -4/3 points\n\nBased on these calculations, rock appears to have the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nFor the second strategy (minimizing risk), both rock and scissors have the same maximum potential loss (-3 for rock, -3 for scissors if the opponent plays optimally against them).\n\nGiven the asymmetric rewards, I think playing rock is the best initial move. It has the highest expected value against a random player, and its biggest vulnerability (paper) requires the opponent to specifically predict I'll play rock, which they have no basis for in the first round.\n\nI'll choose rock for my first move.",
