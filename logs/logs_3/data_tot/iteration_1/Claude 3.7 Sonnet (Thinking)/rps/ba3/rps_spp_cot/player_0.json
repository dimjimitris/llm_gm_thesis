    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some helpful personas to make the best decision.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Strategic Planner, Psychology Expert\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff structure first. This isn't standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. Paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. The corresponding penalties follow the same pattern. This means paper has the highest potential reward.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider typical first-move psychology. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the payoff structure and first-move psychology, paper seems optimal here. If opponent plays rock (common first move), we get 3 points. If they play paper, we tie (0 points). If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. The expected value seems highest with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The asymmetric rewards make paper the best first move. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the potential 1-point loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: While advanced players might anticipate this and choose scissors, most new players don't think that deeply on the first move. Paper remains our best option.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me collaborate with my team of personas.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychology Expert, Strategic Planner\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting development - both players chose paper in the first round. In RPS psychology, after a tie, players often shift to what would beat their previous move, thinking the opponent might repeat. This suggests our opponent might switch to scissors this round.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff structure again. Paper has high reward but high risk. Given the tie on paper, we should consider what move counters the most likely next move from our opponent.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they're likely to switch to scissors (to beat our previous paper), we should play rock. Rock beats scissors giving us 1 point. However, if they anticipate this and play paper, we'd lose 3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tendency to shift after a tie is strong in RPS games. Most casual players won't play the same move twice, especially after a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: While paper technically has the highest expected value in a vacuum, given the context of the previous round, rock seems like the optimal counter-strategy here.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Let's go with rock to counter the likely scissors play from our opponent.\n\n[move] rock"

The pattern so far is paper \u2192 rock. In RPS psychology, after multiple ties, there's increased pressure to break the pattern. Since we just played rock, our opponent might expect us to stay with rock or shift to scissors. They might play paper to counter a potential rock play from us.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider the pattern progression. We went from paper to rock. The natural continuation would be scissors (following the RPS cycle). Our opponent might be thinking along similar lines.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate they'll play paper (to beat our previous rock), scissors would be optimal. If they play rock anticipating our scissors, we'd lose 1 point. If they play scissors following the natural progression, we'd tie again.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive ties, most players strongly avoid moves that could lead to another tie. Since we just played rock, they're less likely to play rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: The asymmetric rewards still favor paper plays in general, but given our specific situation, scissors appears to have the best expected value.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree.

Let me collaborate with my personas to analyze this situation.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychology Expert, Strategic Planner\n\nPsychology Expert: Three consecutive ties following the pattern paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors is remarkable. We've been cycling through the standard RPS sequence exactly as our opponent has. After three ties, most players feel significant pressure to break the pattern while trying to predict the opponent's next move.\n\nGame Theorist: The obvious continuation would be to cycle back to paper. However, given our opponent has matched us exactly three times, they might anticipate this and play scissors to counter our expected paper play.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we expect them to play scissors (anticipating our paper), we should play rock. If they continue the match pattern and also play rock, we tie. If they play paper trying to counter our rock, we lose 3 points - but this requires them to double-guess our strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychology of RPS suggests that after multiple ties, players become determined to win and often try to \"get ahead\" of their opponent's thinking. Breaking the cycle with rock might be unexpected enough to catch them playing scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoff structure and the current pattern, rock appears to have the best expected value for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

Play rock (anticipating we might play scissors to counter their paper)\n\nPsychology Expert: After a big win, many players repeat their successful move, believing their opponent wouldn't expect repetition. There's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we suspect they'll play paper again, scissors would be our optimal counter, giving us +1 point.
