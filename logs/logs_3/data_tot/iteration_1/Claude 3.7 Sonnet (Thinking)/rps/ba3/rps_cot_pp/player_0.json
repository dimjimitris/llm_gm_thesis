    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: \n   - Paper beats rock (winner +3, loser -3)\n   - Rock beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Scissors beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points)\n\n2. Consider expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Paper has highest expected value (+3 vs rock, 0 for tie, -1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock is risky (-3 vs paper is a big loss)\n   - Scissors is balanced but has lower potential gain\n\n3. Since this is the first round with no information about my opponent, I should choose the move with highest expected value.\n\n4. Paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points) while risking minimal loss (-1).\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent patterns:\n   - They may stay with scissors after winning (common strategy)\n   - They might anticipate me switching to rock (which beats scissors) and thus switch to paper\n   - They could be random or using another pattern\n\n3. Evaluate possible moves:\n   - Rock would beat scissors (+1) but lose badly to paper (-3)\n   - Paper would lose again to scissors (-1) but beat rock (+3)\n   - Scissors would tie against scissors (0) and beat paper (+1)\n\n4. Since my opponent just won with scissors, a common pattern is that winning players maintain their move. If they stay with scissors, rock would be my best response.\n\n5. Even if they switch to paper expecting me to play rock, I'd lose only 3 points, which is an acceptable risk compared to the potential gain.\n\n[move] rock"
