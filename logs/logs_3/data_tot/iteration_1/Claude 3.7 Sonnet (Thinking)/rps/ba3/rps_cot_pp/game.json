Analyze the payoff structure: \n   - Paper beats rock (winner +3, loser -3)\n   - Rock beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Scissors beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Same moves = tie (0 points)\n\n2. Consider expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Paper has highest expected value (+3 vs rock, 0 for tie, -1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock is risky (-3 vs paper is a big loss)\n   - Scissors is balanced but has lower potential gain\n\n3. Since this is the first round with no information about my opponent, I should choose the move with highest expected value.\n\n4. Paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points) while risking minimal loss (-1).\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate possible moves:\n   - Rock would beat scissors (+1) but lose badly to paper (-3)\n   - Paper would lose again to scissors (-1) but beat rock (+3)\n   - Scissors would tie against scissors (0) and beat paper (+1)\n\n4. Since my opponent just won with scissors, a common pattern is that winning players maintain their move. If they stay with scissors, rock would be my best response.\n\n5. Even if they switch to paper expecting me to play rock, I'd lose only 3 points, which is an acceptable risk compared to the potential gain.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Paper has highest expected value (+3 vs rock, 0 for tie, -1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock is risky (-3 vs paper is a big loss)\n   - Scissors is balanced but has lower potential gain\n\n3.

Paper beats rock with the highest payoff (3 points), but loses to scissors (-1 points)\n2. Rock beats scissors (1 point), but loses heavily to paper (-3 points)\n3. Scissors beats paper (1 point), but loses to rock (-1 point)\n\nThe point system is asymmetric, with paper-rock having the highest stakes. The expected value of each move depends on what I think my opponent will play:\n\nIf opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n- For rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*1 = -2/3 expected points\n- For paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 expected points\n- For scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0 expected points\n\nBased on this simple analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nSince this is the first round and I don't have information about my opponent's tendencies, and I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I think paper is a reasonable opening move.

A common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is to switch after a win, since the opponent is likely to switch after a loss. Since my opponent won with scissors, they might anticipate I'll switch to rock (to beat their scissors), so they might switch to paper.\n\nGiven these considerations, scissors seems like a reasonable choice.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
