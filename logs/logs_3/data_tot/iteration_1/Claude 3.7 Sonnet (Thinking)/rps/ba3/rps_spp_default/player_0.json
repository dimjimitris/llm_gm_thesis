    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is a modified Rock-Paper-Scissors game with asymmetric rewards. Paper beating Rock has the highest payoff (3 points), while Rock beating Scissors and Scissors beating Paper both have lower payoffs (1 point). This creates an interesting dynamic where Paper becomes particularly valuable.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we should consider common first-move tendencies. Many players choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" If we anticipate this tendency, Paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's calculate the expected value of each move assuming random play from the opponent:\n- Rock: (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (-3 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) = -2/3\n- Paper: (3 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (-1 \u00d7 1/3) = 2/3\n- Scissors: (-1 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) = 0\n\nBased on expected value alone, Paper has the highest expected return.\n\nGame Theorist: That's correct. Additionally, given the asymmetric payoffs, a rational opponent would be incentivized to play Paper more frequently, which would make Scissors more appealing in later rounds. But for the first round, Paper seems optimal.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. Paper both counters the common first-move Rock and has the highest potential payoff.\n\nDecision Analyst: The consensus is clear. Paper offers the best combination of psychological advantage and mathematical expectation for our first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests they're either using similar strategic reasoning to ours or they have a tendency to open with Paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a tie, player psychology typically follows predictable patterns. Many players will shift to a move that would beat their previous move, anticipating their opponent will repeat. Since our opponent played Paper, there's a heightened probability they'll switch to Scissors this round, expecting us to play Paper again.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze the expected values given this new information. If we believe there's a higher probability of them playing Scissors this round, Rock becomes our optimal counter-move. Rock would give us +1 against their Scissors, while Paper would lose us 1 point, and Scissors would result in another tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. The opponent has now revealed they're strategic enough to choose Paper in the opening round. This increases the likelihood they'll attempt to counter their own previous move, making Scissors their probable choice.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: And even if they're using higher-level thinking and anticipate our switch to Rock (thus playing Paper again), the worst outcome would be -3 points. However, behavioral patterns in these games strongly suggest the \"counter previous move\" strategy is most common after a tie.\n\nDecision Analyst: The consensus seems clear.

This significantly reduces the likelihood of coincidence. Either they're deliberately mirroring our moves or we're both following identical strategic reasoning.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: The mirroring behavior is the most compelling explanation. If they're mirroring us, we can potentially exploit this pattern. We should select the move that, if copied, sets us up for the highest payoff in the subsequent round.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze the potential sequences if mirroring continues:\n1. We play Paper \u2192 They play Paper (tie) \u2192 We play Scissors \u2192 They play Scissors (tie)\n2. We play Rock \u2192 They play Rock (tie) \u2192 We play Paper \u2192 They play Paper (tie)\n3. We play Scissors \u2192 They play Scissors (tie) \u2192 We play Rock \u2192 They play Rock (tie)\n\nNone of these immediate sequences break the tie pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: If mirroring is indeed their strategy, we need to think two moves ahead. Since Paper beating Rock gives the highest payoff (3 points), we should consider playing Paper now, expecting a tie, then playing Scissors in the next round to counter their anticipated Paper.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I'm concerned about the mirroring hypothesis being too simplistic. They could also be using similar strategic reasoning, or they might break the pattern this round. Paper gives us the highest potential reward but also the lowest potential loss (-1 vs. -3 for Rock).\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs and the observed pattern, Paper offers the best risk-reward profile for this round.

The opponent broke the mirroring pattern, and we correctly predicted their move. We won with Paper against their Rock, earning 3 points. This reveals they're not consistently mirroring us and might be using a different strategy.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After a significant loss (-3 points for them), players typically adjust their strategy dramatically. The psychological tendency is to counter the opponent's previous successful move. Since we won with Paper, there's a high probability they'll play Scissors this round to counter our anticipated repeated Paper play.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. The opponent just suffered the maximum possible negative score in a single round. This creates a strong incentive for them to adjust. The most straightforward counter to our winning Paper would be Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play Scissors, our optimal response would be Rock. This would give us +1 point while inflicting -1 on them.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: There's also a small possibility they might employ second-level thinking and anticipate our switch to Rock, thus playing Paper themselves. However, the immediate emotional response to a significant loss typically dominates strategic thinking in these games.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs and psychological factors, Rock provides our best expected value in this situation.

Looking at their sequence: first Paper, then Rock, then Scissors - there appears to be a pattern emerging. They seem to be following a clockwise rotation through the moves (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I see another possible pattern - they might be playing what would have beaten their own previous move. They played Paper, lost, then played Rock (beats Paper), lost again, then played Scissors (beats Paper). If this pattern holds, they'll play Paper next (beats their Scissors).\n\nDecision Analyst: Both interpretations point to them playing Paper next. If they continue the clockwise rotation, it's Paper. If they play what would have beaten their previous move, it's also Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: If we predict they'll play Paper, our optimal counter is Scissors, which would give us another victory with +1 point.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: There's a risk they might break their pattern after losing twice consecutively. However, people tend to follow patterns even when losing, often attributing losses to bad luck rather than strategy flaws. The psychological evidence suggests they'll continue their pattern before abandoning it.\n\nDecision Analyst: Scissors gives us the best expected value if we believe Paper is their most probable move. The potential gain (+1) outweighs the potential loss (-1 if they play Rock instead).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

The opponent played Scissors, matching our move. This breaks the patterns we previously identified. Either they've changed their strategy entirely, or they've started mirroring us again (as they did in the first two rounds).\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After consecutive losses, players often revert to simpler strategies like mirroring or random play. The fact that they matched our move could indicate they've returned to mirroring. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict our moves based on the game history.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider multiple possibilities for their next move:\n1. If they've returned to mirroring, they'll play whatever we play.\n2. If they're trying to anticipate our strategy, they might expect us to play Rock (to beat their expected Scissors).\n3. They might also play randomly at this point.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, if we suspect mirroring, we should choose Paper. This sets us up for a tie this round, but if they continue mirroring in the next round, we can play Scissors against their Paper for a win.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. Paper also has the advantage that if they're not mirroring but instead trying to counter what they think we'll play, many players would expect Rock after a Scissors tie. Paper beats Rock, giving us the maximum 3 points in that scenario.\n\nDecision Analyst: Paper indeed maximizes our expected value. If they mirror, we tie.

This is significant - they've now played Rock twice when we played Paper, and both times we've earned the maximum possible points.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Let's review their complete sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock. They've played Rock in two of the last three rounds. After this substantial loss, they're likely to avoid Rock in the next round. Players typically avoid moves that have just resulted in their maximum loss.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. After losing 3 points again, they'll likely avoid Rock. The question is whether they'll play Paper or Scissors. Let's analyze:\n1. If they play Paper, our best response is Scissors (+1)\n2. If they play Scissors, our best response is Rock (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Considering they've played Scissors only once (and that resulted in a tie), they might lean toward that option. Their experience with Paper was also poor in the first round (tie), making Scissors potentially their preferred choice.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I concur. After consecutive major losses with Rock, they're likely to switch to Scissors. Players tend to overcorrect after significant losses, often choosing the option that could have beaten the opponent's previous successful move (our Paper).\n\nDecision Analyst: Rock would give us the best expected value in this case.

The risk is relatively low too - if they play Rock instead, we'd lose 1 point, which is better than the -3 we just experienced.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree Scissors makes sense here. Additionally, we've only played Scissors twice so far (compared to Paper and Rock three times each), which makes it less predictable from their perspective.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: There's also a psychological element where they might avoid playing Scissors since it's the least used move in the game so far.

The opponent has lost with Rock against our Paper three times now, suffering -9 points from this combination alone. There is an extremely high probability they will avoid Rock this round. After such repeated losses, players almost always adapt their strategy.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they're avoiding Rock, they'll play either Paper or Scissors. Based on their pattern of play, Scissors is more likely since it directly counters the Paper that has beaten them repeatedly. They've seen that Paper is our winning move and will likely try to counter it.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

Given the immediate pain of their repeated losses to Paper, the direct counter (Scissors) is psychologically more appealing and therefore more likely.\n\nDecision Analyst: Rock gives us the best expected value in this situation. If they play Scissors as predicted, we win +1. If they play Paper, we lose 3 points, but the probability seems weighted heavily toward them choosing Scissors based on the game history.\n\nGame Theorist: The consensus is clear. Rock is our optimal move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

However, the opponent might have noticed it too. After three Scissors ties, both sides will be eager to break the pattern. The natural counter to Scissors is Rock, which many players would choose after repeated Scissors plays.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze what happened after our previous Scissors ties:\n- After Round 5 (Scissors tie), we played Paper \u2192 they played Rock (we won +3)\n- After Round 8 (Scissors tie), we played Paper \u2192 they played Rock (we won +3)\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent has identified this pattern, they might expect us to play Paper again and counter with Scissors. However, if they're thinking one level deeper, they might anticipate us breaking our own pattern and play accordingly.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given the success we've had with Paper (+9 points total), there's psychological value in returning to our most successful move. However, predictability is dangerous. I believe the opponent will either play Rock (the natural counter to Scissors) or Scissors (anticipating our Paper).\n\nDecision Analyst: If we expect them to play Rock, Paper would be optimal (+3). If we expect them to play Scissors, Rock would be optimal (+1). Given our history and the psychological factors, I think they're more likely to play Rock after three Scissors ties.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

They switched from their successful Paper strategy to Scissors, possibly anticipating our counter. After a Scissors tie, the standard response is Rock to break the pattern.

This suggests the opponent recognized our pattern and adapted. They might expect us to avoid Paper this time and play Rock instead.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. After multiple Scissors ties and seeing that we've adjusted our strategy, they're likely expecting Rock from us.

The risk is if they continue with Scissors or switch to Paper, but given the psychological pressure to break the Scissors pattern with Rock, Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The game theory concept of \"pattern breaking\" suggests Rock is their most likely move. Additionally, Paper has been our most successful move in this game, earning us +9 points total across three wins.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: There's a diminishing probability of continued Scissors ties - players typically can't sustain the psychological tension of repeated ties and feel compelled to break the pattern.

Let's update our game history:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n- Round 3: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 4: Rock vs Scissors (we won +1)\n- Round 5: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 6: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 7: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 8: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 9: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 10: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 11: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 12: Paper vs Scissors (we lost -1)\n- Round 13: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 14: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 15: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 16: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n- Round 17: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 18: Scissors vs Rock (we lost -1)\n- Round 19: Paper vs Scissors (we lost -1)\n\nThe opponent has successfully anticipated our every move for six rounds now.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: This suggests they've developed a strong model of our decision-making process. Our overall statistics are now:\n- Paper: 3 wins (+9), 2 losses (-2), 2 ties (0) = +7 points\n- Rock: 1 win (+1), 4 losses (-12), 1 tie (0) = -11 points\n- Scissors: 0 wins (0), 1 loss (-1), 5 ties (0) = -1 point\n\nDecision Analyst: At this point, we need a fundamental change in strategy. We've tried all three moves during our losing streak and been countered each time. Since they appear to be successfully predicting our strategic reasoning, our best option might be to introduce randomness.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. When an opponent consistently outpredicts your strategic choices, randomization becomes optimal. The classic game theory solution to Rock-Paper-Scissors is actually random play with equal probabilities for each move.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Given the asymmetric payoffs in this variant, we should still weight our randomization. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Scissors has never won us points but has resulted in the most ties and minimal losses.\n\nDecision Analyst: Since we can't use actual randomization, let's select Rock for this round. We've lost with it four times already, making it potentially unexpected at this point. The opponent might anticipate us avoiding Rock due to our negative history with it.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a reasonable approach. Sometimes breaking your own pattern with an unexpected move is the best counter to an opponent who's successfully modeling your decision process.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Let's update our game history:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n- Round 3: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 4: Rock vs Scissors (we won +1)\n- Round 5: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 6: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 7: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 8: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 9: Paper vs Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 10: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 11: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 12: Paper vs Scissors (we lost -1)\n- Round 13: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 14: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 15: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n- Round 16: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n- Round 17: Rock vs Paper (we lost -3)\n- Round 18: Scissors vs Rock (we lost -1)\n- Round 19: Paper vs Scissors (we lost -1)\n- Round 20: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n\nThis gives us a moment to reassess our strategy.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Breaking a losing streak, even with a tie, represents a psychological turning point. After a Rock tie, the conventional follow-up would be Paper to try to win against an anticipated repeat Rock play. However, the opponent has been successfully anticipating our conventional moves.\n\nDecision Analyst: If we look at the patterns after our previous Rock tie (Round 2), we played Paper and won. The opponent might expect us to follow the same pattern. Our options are:\n1. Play Paper - wins against Rock (+3), loses against Scissors (-1)\n2. Play Rock again - ties against Rock (0), loses against Paper (-3)\n3. Play Scissors - loses against Rock (-1), wins against Paper (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent has consistently outpredicted us for six rounds before this tie, they might expect us to play Paper now. If they anticipate this, they might play Scissors to counter.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: I agree. After breaking a negative pattern, players often feel more confident and make more aggressive moves. Paper would be seen as the aggressive move here (highest potential reward), which makes it somewhat predictable.\n\nDecision Analyst: Scissors might be our best play in this situation. If they play Paper expecting our Rock, we win (+1). If they play Rock expecting our Paper, we lose but only minimally (-1). This provides a balanced risk-reward profile given the uncertainty.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

After multiple Scissors ties, Rock would be the conventional play to break the pattern.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: However, the opponent has demonstrated they can anticipate conventional moves. Paper has been our most successful move in this game overall (+7 points total), and follows the pattern of our previous successful responses to Scissors ties.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all factors, Paper offers our best chance at a high reward (+3) if they play Rock, while only risking a smaller loss (-1) if they counter with Scissors. The asymmetric payoff structure makes Paper particularly valuable in this situation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper is our optimal move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

However, the opponent has shown they can anticipate conventional moves. Our recent streak of ties suggests they're either mirroring our moves or thinking along similar strategic lines.\n\nDecision Analyst: After a Paper tie, the conventional responses and their outcomes are:\n- We play Scissors \u2192 They anticipate and play Rock \u2192 We lose (-1)\n- We play Paper again \u2192 They play Scissors expecting this \u2192 We lose (-1)\n- We play Rock \u2192 They play Paper expecting our Scissors \u2192 We lose (-3)\n\nThe situation is challenging regardless of our choice.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the opponent's demonstrated strategic thinking, they might expect us to play Scissors after a Paper tie. If they anticipate this, they would play Rock to counter. Our worst move historically has been Rock (-11 points total), which makes Scissors somewhat predictable as our next play.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: After multiple consecutive ties, there's strong psychological pressure to break the pattern. The opponent might expect us to make an aggressive move like Scissors. Playing Rock would be counter-intuitive given our negative history with it, which might make it unexpected.\n\nDecision Analyst: Considering all factors, Rock could be our optimal play despite its poor history. If they expect Scissors and play Rock, we tie (0). If they play Paper expecting our Scissors or anticipating our Rock, we lose (-3), but this seems less likely given the pattern of ties.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock gives us our best chance to break the tie pattern with minimal risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

After a Rock tie, Paper would be the conventional response. However, if they're mirroring us, they'll match whatever we play. If they're trying to predict us, they'll expect Paper as our next move.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they're mirroring us, our choice doesn't matter for this round (tie guaranteed), but sets up the next round. If they're predicting us, they'll likely expect Paper after Rock, so they might play Scissors to counter.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the unusual pattern of consecutive ties, I believe there's a high probability they're intentionally mirroring us. If so, we should select the move that, when mirrored, sets us up for the highest payoff in the subsequent round.\n\nBehavioral Strategist: Paper has been our most successful move overall. If we play Paper, expect a tie, then play Scissors in the next round against their anticipated Paper, we could break the tie streak with a win.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. If they're mirroring, Paper creates another tie but sets up a potential win. If they're not mirroring and instead expecting Paper from us, they'll play Scissors and we'll lose only 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
