Tie.\n\nIt seems like there might be a pattern in my opponent's moves. Let me analyze what they're doing:\n\nFor the first many rounds, they seem to be mirroring my moves (resulting in ties).\nThen around round 14-21, they started playing more strategically.\n\nLet me check if they're using a pattern like \"one move ahead\" or \"one move behind\":\n\nRound 14: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (one move behind my previous move which was Paper)\nRound 15: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (matching)\nRound 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (one move ahead of my previous move which was Paper)\nRound 17: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (one move ahead of Scissors)\nRound 18: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (one move ahead of Rock)\nRound 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (matching my current move?)\nRound 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (one move ahead of Scissors)\nRound 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (matching again)\n\nThe pattern isn't completely clear, but it seems like they might be employing a strategy where they play what would beat my previous move (which would be \"one move ahead\" in the cycle).\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll try to outthink them by playing what would counter their predicted move:\n- If they're using a \"one move ahead\" strategy based on my last move (Rock), they might play Paper\n- To counter Paper, I should play Scissors\n\nI'll play Scissors next.",

We've played several rounds, and I'm noticing that the opponent tends to copy my previous move often.\n3. Here's the pattern of our moves:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 7: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 9: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 13: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 14: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\nRound 15: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\nRound 17: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\nRound 18: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\nRound 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\nRound 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\nRound 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 22: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\nRound 23: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the opponent often plays what I played in the previous round. So if I want to win, I should play the move that beats what I played in my last turn.\n\nFor example:\n- If I played Rock last round, I should play Paper this round (as the opponent will likely play Rock)\n- If I played Paper last round, I should play Scissors this round (as the opponent will likely play Paper)\n- If I played Scissors last round, I should play Rock this round (as the opponent will likely play Scissors)\n\nBased on this pattern, since I played Rock in the last round, I should play Paper this round to beat the opponent's expected Rock.",

I've won 3 rounds:\n   - Rock vs Scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rock vs Scissors (+1 point)\n   - Paper vs Rock (+3 points)\n\n2. I've lost 1 round:\n   - Scissors vs Rock (-1 point)\n\n3. The majority of rounds (11 so far) have ended in ties, suggesting my opponent is likely trying to predict and mirror my moves.\n\nMy current score is: +1 +1 -1 +3 = +4 points\n\nI need to think about how to break this pattern. My opponent seems to be following my moves quite closely, but there's a slight lag - they're potentially using my previous move to determine their next move. However, they've also deviated a couple of times.\n\nLet's see if we can identify a pattern in my opponent's behavior:\n- After I played paper the first time, they played paper.\n- After I played rock, they played rock.\n- After I played scissors, they played scissors.\n- This pattern of mirroring continued for many rounds.\n- When I played scissors again later, they played rock (beating me).\n- When I played rock after that, they played scissors (I won).\n- When I played paper last, they played rock (I won).\n\nIt seems like they might have shifted from pure mirroring to a \"beat the previous move\" strategy, but then went back to mirroring or a different strategy.\n\nFor my next move, I could:\n1. Continue with scissors, assuming they might play paper based on my last move being paper\n2. Play rock, anticipating they might play scissors to beat my last move (paper)\n3. Play paper, anticipating they might play rock to mirror my last move\n\nGiven the higher payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the possibility that they might be reverting to mirroring, I think playing scissors is a good strategy. If they play paper (to mirror my last move), I win +1. If they play rock (to beat my scissors), I lose -1. If they play scissors (to mirror what I might do), it's a tie.",

Since paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3), it makes paper an attractive choice for me. Even if my opponent doesn't play rock, the worst case is:\n- If opponent plays paper too: tie (0 points)\n- If opponent plays scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n\nSo paper seems like a good first move given the asymmetric payoffs and psychological tendencies of new players.\n\nLet me make my move:",

If opponent chooses Scissors, I lose only -1 (not as bad as losing with Rock)\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- If probabilities are equal (1/3 each):\n  - Paper: (1/3 * 3) + (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -1) = 1 + 0 - 0.33 = 0.67\n  - Rock: (1/3 * 0) + (1/3 * -3) + (1/3 * 1) = 0 - 1 + 0.33 = -0.67\n  - Scissors: (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * 1) + (1/3 * 0) = 0.33 + 0.33 + 0 = 0.66\n\nThis suggests Paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nI'll choose Paper for my first move, as it offers the best risk-reward profile in this game.",

Since paper beats rock and gives 3 points (the highest reward), I'll try paper again. If they're truly copying me, we'll tie again.

I've played rock in the last round and it ended in a tie. The opponent might expect me to switch to paper (since paper beats rock), so they might play scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nHowever, they might also be thinking one level deeper and anticipate that I'll play rock again, in which case they might play paper. \n\nGiven that scissors has a more favorable risk/reward ratio (can win 1 and lose only 1), I'll go with scissors this time.",

But if they think I'll anticipate this and play rock, they might play paper.\n\nThis multi-level thinking can go on indefinitely. Let me focus on what seems most likely based on recent patterns.\n\nThe opponent has been mirroring my moves quite often, but when they don't, they've been playing rock and scissors more frequently lately.

Here's the pattern of our moves:\n\nRound 1: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 2: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 7: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 9: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 11: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\nRound 12: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 13: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 14: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won)\nRound 15: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\nRound 16: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock (I lost)\nRound 17: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost)\nRound 18: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\nRound 19: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\nRound 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost)\nRound 21: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\nRound 22: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won)\nRound 23: I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the opponent often plays what I played in the previous round. So if I want to win, I should play the move that beats what I played in my last turn.\n\nFor example:\n- If I played Rock last round, I should play Paper this round (as the opponent will likely play Rock)\n- If I played Paper last round, I should play Scissors this round (as the opponent will likely play Paper)\n- If I played Scissors last round, I should play Rock this round (as the opponent will likely play Scissors)\n\nBased on this pattern, since I played Rock in the last round, I should play Paper this round to beat the opponent's expected Rock.",

I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n2. I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n3. I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (tie)\n4. I played Paper, opponent played Paper (tie)\n5.

I played Rock, opponent played Rock (tie)\n\nIt seems like the opponent is mostly mirroring my moves (resulting in ties), but occasionally deviating. Let me check if there's a pattern to when they don't mirror:\n\n- In round 5, I played Scissors, they played Rock (counter)\n- In round 14, I played Rock, they played Scissors (I won - they played what would have beaten my previous move)\n- In round 16, I played Scissors, they played Rock (counter)\n- In round 17, I played Rock, they played Paper (counter)\n- In round 18, I played Paper, they played Scissors (counter)\n- In round 19, I played Scissors, they played Paper (they played what I played before)\n- In round 20, I played Paper, they played Scissors (counter)\n- In round 22, I played Scissors, they played Paper (they played what I played before)\n\nThere seems to be two patterns:\n1. Most of the time, they mirror my move\n2. Occasionally they either:\n   - Play what would counter my previous move\n   - Play what I played previously\n\nFor this next round, I'll try to anticipate this behavior. If they're following pattern #2, they might play Scissors (what I just played) or Paper (to counter my Rock). If they're mirroring, they'll play Paper.\n\nPlaying Paper would result in either a tie (if they mirror) or a win for me (if they play Scissors based on my previous move).\n\nI'll choose Paper.",

I've played multiple rounds, and most of them ended in ties, which suggests that the opponent might be mirroring my moves.\n2. However, there were a few rounds where I won or lost, which indicates that the mirroring isn't perfect.\n\nLet's count the outcomes so far:\n- Ties: Many rounds (most of the time both players made the same move)\n- Wins: I won with scissors against paper (twice) and rock against scissors (once)\n- Losses: I lost with scissors against rock (twice), rock against paper (once), and paper against scissors (twice)\n\nMy total score is: 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 3 - 1 - 1 = -3\n\nGiven that there have been many ties, it seems like the opponent might be using a strategy similar to mine or is trying to predict and match my moves.\n\nSince paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points for winning, -3 for losing), it's a higher risk, higher reward option. Rock and scissors both have a more balanced risk-reward profile (1 point for winning, -1 for losing).\n\nFor this next round, I'll try rock. It seems that the opponent has played scissors after I've played rock in recent rounds, so rock might be a good choice now.",

Recently, the opponent has been making more independent moves. The opponent might have been analyzing my pattern and now is trying to counter my moves.\n\nGiven the scoring system:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nPaper has the highest potential reward (3 points), but also the highest potential loss (-3 points).\n\nLet me try playing scissors in the next round. The opponent might expect me to play Rock again since that's what I did in the last round. If they expect Rock, they might play Paper to win 3 points, in which case my Scissors would beat their Paper.",
