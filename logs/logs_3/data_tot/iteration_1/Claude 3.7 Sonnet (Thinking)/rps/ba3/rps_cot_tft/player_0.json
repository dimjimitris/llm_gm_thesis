    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure of the game:\n   - rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n   - paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n   - scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric - paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) when it wins.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to inform my strategy.\n\n4. Looking at risk-reward ratios:\n   - Paper: potential gain of 3, potential loss of 1 (best ratio)\n   - Rock: potential gain of 1, potential loss of 3 (worst ratio)\n   - Scissors: potential gain of 1, potential loss of 1 (balanced ratio)\n\n5. The optimal first move appears to be paper since it offers the highest potential reward with a relatively small potential loss.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluating possible counter-strategies:\n   - If they stick with paper, my best move is scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting my scissors), I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Since we both played paper in the first round, there's a reasonable chance they'll expect me to counter with scissors, so they might play rock.\n\n5. However, they might also stick with paper hoping for the high reward if they win.\n\n6.

I've also unintentionally established a pattern in my last three moves:\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   \n6. Based on their consistent pattern throughout the game and the fact that scissors would appear next in their sequence, I believe they're most likely to play scissors in this round.\n\n7.

After a tie with both playing rock, players typically:\n   - Often switch to paper to beat the previous rock\n   - Rarely stick with rock after a tie\n   - Sometimes try to predict the opponent's change and counter it\n\n5. Looking at their previous behavior after our rock-rock tie in Round 7, they played paper in Round 8.\n\n6. Their overall pattern suggests they frequently follow rock with paper (as they did in rounds 7\u21928 and 4\u21925\u21926).\n\n7. Based on this analysis and their historical tendencies, I believe they are most likely to play paper in this round.\n\n[move] scissors"
