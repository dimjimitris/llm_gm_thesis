Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoffs for each move:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point if I win, -1 point if I lose\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points if I win, -3 points if I lose\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point if I win, -1 point if I lose\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Let me calculate the expected value of each move assuming random play from my opponent:\n   - Rock: (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3 \u00d7 3) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -1) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3 \u00d7 -1) + (1/3 \u00d7 1) + (1/3 \u00d7 0) = 0\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value because the reward for paper beating rock (+3) is significantly higher than its penalty when losing to scissors (-1).\n\n5. Therefore, paper is the optimal first move in this payoff structure.\n\n[move] paper"

I need to analyze what this means:\n   - My opponent might have used similar reasoning about expected values\n   - They might have a preference for playing paper\n   - It could have been random chance\n\n3. If my opponent tends to repeat moves or prefers paper, scissors would be the best counter.\n\n4. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper again, I get +1\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I get -1\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors, I get 0\n\n5. If they anticipate me switching to scissors, they might play rock. However, given the previous round was a tie, many players tend to maintain their original move at least once more.\n\n6. The risk/reward for scissors is reasonable: potential gain of +1, potential loss of -1.\n\n7.

I notice my opponent has played scissors quite frequently (4 out of 11 rounds), including just now.\n\n4. After winning, players often repeat their successful move. Since they just won with scissors, there's a good chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n5. Even if they anticipate I'll play rock to counter scissors, their natural counter would be paper.\n\n6. Given the frequency of scissors in their play history and their recent success with it, rock seems like the safest option.\n\n7. Rock gives me +1 against scissors, ties against rock, and loses -3 against paper.\n\n8. The risk/reward ratio favors rock given their apparent preference for scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

My prediction that they would play paper was incorrect. They played rock instead.\n\n3. After their previous wins:\n   - After winning in Round 2 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in Round 3 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After winning in Round 4 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in Round 11 with scissors, they played rock\n   - After winning in Round 15 with paper, they played scissors\n\n4. There's no clear pattern in how they follow up wins, but they tend not to repeat the same move after winning. Based on this pattern, they're unlikely to play rock again.\n\n5. After winning, players often anticipate that their opponent will switch to a move that would have beaten their last move. Since I lost with scissors, they might expect me to play rock next.\n\n6. To counter an expected rock from me, they would play paper.\n\n7. Looking at their overall move distribution:\n   - Rock: 8 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   Rock has been played more frequently, suggesting they might balance by playing something else next.\n\n8. Given these considerations, paper seems most likely as their next move.\n\n[move] paper"

After paper ties in the past:\n   - After Round 1 (paper tie), they played rock\n   - After Round 8 (paper tie), they played scissors\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after ties in general:\n   - No consistent pattern, but they rarely play the same move immediately after a tie\n\n4. Players typically avoid playing the same move consecutively, especially after a tie, so they're unlikely to play paper again.\n\n5. After our previous paper tie in Round 8, they played scissors, which might indicate a tendency.\n\n6. Given their overall move distribution (Rock: 8, Paper: 7, Scissors: 6), scissors is slightly \"due\" in terms of frequency.\n\n7. If they play scissors (which seems likely), rock would be my best counter (+1).\n\n8. If they play rock instead, I'd lose (-3), but this seems less likely given the previous pattern after paper ties and tie psychology.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at what they did after rock ties in the past:\n   - After Round 6 (rock tie), they played scissors\n   - After Round 12 (rock tie), they played paper\n\n3. They have never played rock again immediately after a rock tie.\n\n4. Their current move distribution:\n   - Rock: 9 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   \n5. Since rock has been played significantly more than scissors, they may be inclined to play scissors for balance.\n\n6. However, looking at their previous pattern after rock ties, they played paper in Round 12 which is the more recent pattern.\n\n7. After consecutive ties (as we've had in rounds 21-22), players typically try to break the pattern with a strategic shift.\n\n8. If they play paper (which one previous pattern suggests), scissors would be my best counter (+1).\n\n[move] scissors"

I just won by playing scissors against their paper. After losing, my opponent has never repeated the same move in the next round.\n\n3. After their previous losses:\n   - After losing in Round 5 with rock, they played rock (unusual exception)\n   - After losing in Round 9 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After losing in Round 10 with paper, they played scissors\n   - After losing in Round 13 with paper, they played rock\n   - After losing in Round 14 with rock, they played paper\n   - After losing in Round 18 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After losing in Round 19 with scissors, they played rock\n\n4. Looking at their more recent behavior after losses, there's a slight tendency to cycle through rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors and back after losses.\n\n5. Since they just lost with paper, they will likely play either rock or scissors, with rock being slightly more probable based on recent patterns.\n\n6. Players often anticipate their opponent will repeat a winning move, so they may play rock expecting me to play scissors again.\n\n7. If they play rock (which seems most likely), paper would be my best counter (+3).\n\n[move] paper"
