Let me think about a reasonable first move based on the payoff structure.\n\nThe asymmetric scoring is interesting - paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty than the other outcomes. This suggests that:\n1. Playing paper has the highest potential reward (if opponent plays rock)\n2. Playing rock has the highest potential penalty (if opponent plays paper)\n\nFor a first move against an unknown opponent, I could:\n1. Play paper for the highest potential payoff\n2. Play scissors to avoid the highest potential penalty (avoiding rock which could lead to -3)\n3. Play rock as a conventional first move in RPS\n\nSince I don't have information about my opponent yet, and the expected value calculation would be equal for all moves against a perfectly random opponent, I think I'll choose paper for my first move.

There was a streak of Paper (rounds 10-12), then a streak of Rock (rounds 13-17), and now we've had two Papers.\n\nGiven that the opponent has played Paper twice in a row, there's a decent chance they'll play Paper again. If they do, Scissors would be the optimal choice.\n\nHowever, they might also switch to Rock after a streak of Papers. If they do switch to Rock, Paper would be the optimal choice.\n\nGiven the higher payoff of Paper beating Rock (3 points) compared to Scissors beating Paper (1 point), and considering the opponent's pattern of streaks, I'll go with Paper for this round.",

This creates an asymmetry in the game.\n\nSince this is the first move and I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (which I assume means they haven't played before or I don't have information about their past moves), I don't have any data on their tendencies.\n\nIn a standard rock-paper-scissors game with equal payoffs, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with 1/3 probability. However, with these asymmetric payoffs, the equilibrium changes.\n\nGiven the higher payoff for paper beating rock, there might be an incentive to play paper more often, which would mean the other player might play scissors more often to counter that. But knowing that, I might want to play rock more often.\n\nWithout knowing the other player's tendencies, and given the higher reward for paper beating rock, I think I'll start with paper. Many players tend to play rock on their first move, and if they do, I'll get 3 points. If they play paper too, it's a tie.

The game is balanced so that each move has exactly one move it beats and one move it loses to.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. The payoffs are asymmetric - paper beating rock gives more points (+3) than rock beating scissors or scissors beating paper (+1). This means that playing paper has potentially higher rewards, but also higher risk (-3 if they play scissors).\n2. Studies have shown that in rock-paper-scissors, humans tend to play rock slightly more often as their first move. However, I don't know if my opponent is following typical human psychology.\n3. If my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate that I would choose paper (given the higher reward), and thus play scissors to counter.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, I'll choose rock for my first move.

However, after I played Scissors repeatedly and won 3 times in a row, they finally switched to Rock in the last round.\n\nThis suggests that the opponent might be catching on to my strategy of playing Scissors to counter their Paper tendency.

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what's been happening in the game so far:\n\n1. My opponent seems to follow certain patterns:\n   - They've played paper frequently (8 times)\n   - They've played rock several times (7 times)\n   - They've played scissors several times (7 times)\n\n2. Recent rounds:\n   - I played Rock and my opponent played Rock (tie)\n   - I played Scissors and my opponent played Rock (I lost)\n\nSince my opponent just played Rock, there's a chance they might switch to paper next (a common pattern in Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play what would beat the opponent's previous move). If they think I'll play scissors again, they might play rock again. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper.\n\nLooking at the payoff structure, paper beats rock giving the highest payoff (3 points). So I'll try to maximize my potential gain by playing scissors, which would beat paper if my opponent switches to it.",
