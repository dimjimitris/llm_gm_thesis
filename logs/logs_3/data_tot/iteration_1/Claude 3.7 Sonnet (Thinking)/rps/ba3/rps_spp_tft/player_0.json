    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3). Rock and scissors both have lower risk/reward profiles (+1/-1). Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we should consider the expected value of each move.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: If we assume the opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability for each move), the expected values are:\n- Rock: (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d71 = -2/3\n- Paper: (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 2/3\n- Scissors: (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0\n\nPaper has the highest expected value in a truly random environment.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their first move because it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" If we anticipate this tendency, paper would be the optimal choice for maximum points.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with paper as our first move. It has the highest expected value against random play and counters the common first-move rock tendency.\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us information about our opponent's reasoning process. They might be using similar strategic thinking as us.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players typically consider three options: stick with the same move, or switch to one of the other two moves. We need to anticipate what's most likely.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Many players follow patterns like \"switch after a tie.\" If they switch from paper, they could go to either rock or scissors. We should evaluate each possibility.\n\nPsychological Strategist: One common tendency is for players to switch to what would have beaten the previous move. Since paper tied with paper, they might switch to scissors (which beats paper).\n\nRisk Management Expert: If we predict they'll switch to scissors, our best counter is rock. This would give us +1 points. Even if we're wrong and they choose paper instead, we'd only lose 3 points, which is a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Based on psychological patterns after ties and our risk assessment, rock seems like the optimal move for this round.\n\n[move] rock"

They may continue this pattern and switch again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing, players often try to counter what their opponent just played. Since we played rock, they might anticipate we'll play rock again (since it worked) and choose paper to counter it.\n\nRisk Management Expert: If we believe they'll switch to paper (to beat our previous rock), we should play scissors. This would give us a +1 point reward. If we're wrong and they play rock, we'd lose only 1 point, which is less risky than other options.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Based on psychological patterns after losses and common counter-strategies, scissors seems like the optimal move for this round. It counters the likely paper play from our opponent.\n\n[move] scissors"

They've returned to paper after losing with scissors. This could indicate a cyclical pattern, or perhaps they're trying to be unpredictable but running out of ideas.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing twice in a row, players often get frustrated and make a more dramatic strategy change. Since they've now played paper twice and scissors once, but never rock, they might finally choose rock to break their losing streak.\n\nRisk Management Expert: If we anticipate they'll play rock, our best move would be paper. This would give us +3 points if correct, and we'd only lose 1 point if they play scissors instead.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

Their sequence shows they've used scissors twice, which indicates possible randomness or desperation after multiple losses.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After four consecutive losses, players typically take one of two approaches: either return to what initially worked best (paper, which at least tied) or try to mimic their opponent's successful moves (our last move was rock).\n\nRisk Management Expert: If we predict they'll return to paper (their most \"successful\" move) or mimic our last move (rock), then scissors would counter paper and tie with rock - making it a reasonable choice with limited downside.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.
