However, since round 6, they've mirrored my scissors play 3 times, so that one deviation might have been a one-time thing or part of a more complex pattern.\n\nAt this point, I should consider:\n1. Continue probing with different moves to see if there are other exceptions to the mirroring pattern\n2. Try to exploit the mirroring pattern somehow\n3. Try to establish a new pattern that might confuse the opponent\n\nGiven the strong mirroring tendency, it's hard to gain an advantage in this game. If I play paper, they'll likely play paper (tie). If I play rock, they'll likely play rock (tie). If I play scissors, they'll most likely play scissors (tie), with that one exception where they played rock.\n\nFor this next round, I think I'll try paper again. If they're truly mirroring most of the time, we'll tie again.

A temporary change in strategy they later abandoned\n\nGiven that they're consistently mirroring my moves now, I need to consider what happens if I keep playing the same move repeatedly. If they continue mirroring, we'll just keep tying. But if they eventually deviate from mirroring, I want to choose a move that gives me the best chance of winning.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, if I expect them to mirror my move, the expected value is 0 for any move. However, if they suddenly deviate:\n- If I play rock and they deviate, they'll likely play paper (I lose 3 points)\n- If I play paper and they deviate, they'll likely play scissors (I lose 1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they deviate, they'll likely play rock (I lose 1 point)\n\nBased on this, rock seems to have the highest potential loss. If I expect them to mirror me most of the time but occasionally deviate, scissors or paper would be better choices.\n\nI'll choose rock for this round, primarily to continue exploring their pattern.",

This makes it very difficult to win, as they're matching me move for move. The only time I lost was when I played scissors and they played rock (which beats scissors).\n\nLet me think about what strategy makes sense here:\n\n1. If I keep playing any move, my opponent will likely mirror it, resulting in ties\n2. That one exception where they played rock against scissors could be:\n   - An actual deviation in their strategy\n   - A random choice\n   - A one-time test\n   - Part of a more complex pattern I haven't detected yet\n\nGiven how many times they've now mirrored my scissors move after that one deviation, I'm inclined to believe it was either a random deviation or a one-time test.\n\nSince ties give 0 points and I'm trying to maximize my score, I need to find a way to break this pattern. I could:\n\n1. Continue testing different moves to see if there's any pattern to when they might deviate\n2. Try to signal through my move sequence some kind of coordination (though this is unlikely to work)\n3.

Game theory: In a standard rock-paper-scissors game with equal payoffs, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).

My opponent's behavior is extremely consistent - they mirror my moves almost every single time, with just one exception early in the game when they played rock against my scissors.\n\nLet me review what's happened so far:\n- We've played 20 rounds\n- 19 times my opponent has mirrored exactly what I played\n- Only 1 time they deviated, when they played rock against my scissors early in the game\n- Since then, they've mirrored my scissors move multiple times\n\nThis suggests that:\n1. My opponent is almost certainly using a strategy that involves mirroring my moves\n2. That one deviation might have been either:\n   - A random deviation from their strategy\n   - Part of a more complex pattern I haven't fully identified yet\n   - A one-time test to see how I would respond\n\nSince the mirroring has been so consistent, I don't think I can outpredict my opponent's next move directly. If I choose rock, they'll likely choose rock. If I choose paper, they'll likely choose paper. If I choose scissors, they'll likely choose scissors.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- rock vs scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- paper vs rock: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors vs paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nIf there's any pattern to when they might deviate, it would be valuable to know. The only deviation so far was when I played scissors and they played rock (giving them +1 and me -1). \n\nLet me test something different this time. I'll play paper again. If they mirror as expected, we'll tie again. But in the small chance they deviate, playing paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3 if they play rock) with moderate risk (-1 if they play scissors).",
