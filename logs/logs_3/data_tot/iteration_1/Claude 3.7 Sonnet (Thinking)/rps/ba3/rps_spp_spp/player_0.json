    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper beating Rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3). The other matchups are standard at +1/-1. This changes the expected value calculations significantly from traditional RPS.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no prior information about their tendencies. However, research shows that Rock is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\" This would make Paper an attractive first move for us given the high payoff.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the payoff matrix, playing Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Rock and Scissors both have more modest risk-reward profiles (+1/-1). Without any data on the opponent, we need to balance risk and reward.\n\nGame Theorist: In a purely mathematical sense, if we assume the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move), the expected value would be identical for any choice we make: (1/3)(win points) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(loss points).\n\nPsychological Strategist: I still think Paper is a good strategic first move because of the tendency for new players to choose Rock. If they do play Rock, our +3 gain would be significant.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree. The potential upside of Paper outweighs the downside in the first move, especially against a new player who might default to Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This could indicate several things: they might be employing a similar strategic thought process as us, they might have anticipated our Paper move, or it might have been a random choice.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Now we have our first piece of information about the opponent. After a tie with both players choosing Paper, there are typical human responses. Many players will either:\n1. Stick with the same move thinking it worked (wasn't punished)\n2. Shift to what would have beaten their previous move (Scissors to beat Paper)\n3. Shift to what would have been beaten by their previous move (Rock)\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since the opponent played Paper in the first round, we need to consider the probabilities of their next move. If they're a strategic player, they might anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, and thus they might play Rock to counter our anticipated Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The payoff matrix is important here. If they stick with Paper and we play Scissors, we get +1. If they switch to Rock and we play Rock, it's a tie (0). If they switch to Scissors and we play Rock, we get +1. Rock seems to have good expected value here.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing Rock. Many players will switch after a tie, and Scissors is a common second move after starting with Paper (to break the pattern). Rock would counter this effectively.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock is also a safer play in terms of risk management. The worst-case scenario with Rock is losing 3 points (if they play Paper again), but we gain 1 point if they play Scissors. Given that we just had a Paper-Paper tie, the psychological likelihood of them playing Paper again seems lower than them switching.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with Rock for this round. It protects against a likely Scissors play while offering a moderate reward if correct.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Now we have more information about their pattern. Let's analyze what might happen next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing a round, players often adjust their strategy. Having lost with Scissors against our Rock, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Switch to Paper (to beat the Rock they just lost to)\n2. Try Rock themselves (either as a \"reset\" or because they think we might switch to Scissors)\n3. Less likely: stick with Scissors despite losing (rare but occurs when players think the other player won't expect it)\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the sequence so far:\n- Round 1: Paper-Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock-Scissors (we win)\nBased on this pattern and common player behavior after a loss, Paper is indeed the most likely next move from the opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they'll play Paper, we should counter with Scissors. This would give us +1 point. However, if we're wrong and they play Rock, we'd lose 1 point. If they repeat Scissors, we'd tie. The expected value favors Scissors if we believe Paper is their most likely move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. Players who just lost often try to counter what beat them, which means Paper is the highest probability move from the opponent. They're thinking \"they'll play Rock again since it worked for them.\"\n\nStatistical Analyst: There's another factor to consider: the asymmetric payoffs. Even though Scissors would counter their likely Paper move, the reward is only +1. If we played Paper ourselves and they played Rock, we'd lose 3 points. So even though Scissors has positive expected value, the downside risk of being wrong is less severe than with other choices.\n\nGame Theorist: After weighing all factors, Scissors appears to be the optimal play for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let's recap:\n- Round 1: They played Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: They played Scissors (they lost)\n- Round 3: They played Rock (they won)\n\nThis could be a simple cycle of Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, which would suggest they'll play Paper next. Or they could be adapting to our moves strategically.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning the last round with Rock against our Scissors, the opponent might:\n1. Stick with Rock since it just worked for them (+1 points)\n2. Anticipate that we'll switch to Paper to counter their Rock, so they might play Scissors\n3. Try to be unpredictable and play Paper\n\nAlso noteworthy - we've now played all three options once (Paper, Rock, Scissors) in sequence, which makes our pattern quite predictable if they've noticed.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the game theory aspect, if we assume equal probability for each of their moves, any choice we make has the same expected value. However, given their pattern and psychology after a win, Rock has a higher probability of being repeated.\n\nGame Theorist: People often stick with winning moves, so Rock is indeed likely. If they play Rock again, our optimal counter is Paper. This would give us +3 points if successful, though it carries the risk of -1 if they anticipate and play Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I think Paper is our best move here. Players often repeat winning moves, especially in this game. And even if they don't, breaking our own pattern of Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors is strategically sound to become less predictable.\n\nStatistical Analyst: While Paper has the highest risk-reward profile, the psychological advantage of countering a likely repeated Rock makes it worth the risk in this situation. The expected value is positive given the higher probability they'll play Rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Let's go with Paper for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent has now played Scissors twice, and they've won with it in the most recent round. There's no clear cyclical pattern, but they might be developing a preference for Scissors since it worked well for them.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After winning with Scissors, there's a strong psychological tendency to repeat that move. Players often stick with what just worked for them. Additionally, they may have recognized that we've been playing in a cyclical pattern ourselves (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper), making us predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe Scissors is likely to be played again, Rock is our optimal counter. It would give us +1 points if correct. Even if they switch to Paper (countering our anticipated Rock), we'd lose 3 points, but the probability seems lower given their recent success with Scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing Rock. People tend to develop favorite moves in RPS, and Scissors might be becoming theirs. Plus, they've just had success with it, increasing the likelihood of repetition.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Our current score is -1 point (0+1-1-1).

The opponent has beaten us three times in a row, suggesting they're effectively predicting our moves. Looking at their sequence, they don't have a simple pattern, but they seem to be strategically countering what they anticipate we'll play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: They've won the last three rounds, which gives them confidence and momentum. After their successful Paper play that gave them +3 points, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper again since it gave them a big win\n2. Anticipate that we'll play Scissors to counter their Paper, so they might play Rock\n3. Try something completely different to remain unpredictable\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we've lost three rounds consecutively, we need to break our pattern. The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us. At this point, playing unpredictably might be better than trying to out-predict them.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Since we're at -4 points, we might need to take a calculated risk. Rock has a balanced risk-reward profile (+1/-1) against Scissors/Paper. Paper has high risk-reward (+3/-1) against Rock/Scissors. Scissors has medium risk-reward (+1/-3) against Paper/Rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I suggest we play Rock. Here's why: the opponent just won big with Paper (+3). They might anticipate we'll counter with Scissors, leading them to play Rock. By playing Rock ourselves, we'd at least tie rather than lose. And if they get overconfident and play Paper again, we'd only lose 3 points (which we can afford to risk at this point).\n\nGame Theorist: I disagree. I think Scissors is the better play. If they repeat Paper (which won them +3 points last round), we win +1. If they play Rock anticipating our Scissors, we lose only 1 point. The expected value seems better than Rock, especially since we need to catch up.\n\nStatistical Analyst: After analyzing both suggestions, I agree that Scissors offers better expected value given the possible opponent moves. The opponent has shown a pattern of switching moves rather than repeating, which suggests they might not play Paper again, but Scissors has the best risk-adjusted potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Additionally, if they're following their emerging pattern, they might play Paper next, resulting in a tie rather than another loss.\n\nStatistical Analyst: The potential +3 gain from playing Paper against a possible Rock is also strategically important given our current negative score.

The optimal counter to Rock would be Paper.\n\nStatistical Analyst: However, I'm concerned about our approach. We've been trying to predict their moves and counter accordingly, but this has resulted in six straight losses. Perhaps we should introduce some controlled randomness to break our own predictability.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. At this point, the opponent seems to have identified our thinking pattern. Let's consider Scissors for this round. If they follow their pattern and play Rock, we'd lose only 1 point (better than -3). If they anticipate us playing Paper (to counter their expected Rock) and play Scissors instead, our Scissors would tie. And if they repeat Paper (which they've now played successfully multiple times), we'd win +1.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors provides a balanced risk-reward profile in this scenario. It's not the most predictable counter to their pattern, which might work in our favor if they're anticipating our moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've completed this cycle three times now, which strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next following their established pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe Scissors is their next move, our optimal counter would be Rock. This would give us +1 points if correct and potentially break our losing streak.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, we need to trust the pattern analysis rather than overthinking it.
