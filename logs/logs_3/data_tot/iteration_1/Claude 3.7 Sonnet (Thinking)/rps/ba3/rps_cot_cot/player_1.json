    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the scoring system of this rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points (high stakes)\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point (low stakes)\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point (low stakes)\n\n2. Against a fresh player, I should consider what first moves are common:\n   - Many new players choose rock as their first move\n   - The asymmetric scoring makes paper the highest-reward move (3 points)\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I gain 3 points\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point\n\n3. Comparing expected values:\n   - Paper has the best risk-reward ratio (potentially win 3, potentially lose 1)\n   - Rock and scissors both have equal potential gain (1 point) \n   - Rock has the worst potential loss (3 points)\n\n4. Given this is the first round with a new player who might default to rock, paper offers the highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Considering the possible opponent strategies:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they'll likely play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch randomly, scissors is still a reasonable choice for them\n   - The most threatening move they could make against me is scissors\n\n4.

Critical insight about opponent strategy:\n   - Their moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They have now broken their pattern twice: in Round 7 and Round 11\n   - Both times they broke pattern, they successfully countered my move\n   - This suggests they're becoming more adaptive and trying to stay one step ahead\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - After winning several rounds by predicting their moves, they've caught on to my strategy\n   - They're now trying to anticipate what I'll play based on their previous pattern\n   - They're demonstrating higher-level strategic thinking\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - If they think I'll expect scissors (continuing their original pattern), they'll play rock\n   - If they think I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock, they might play scissors\n   - This has become a complex mind game with multiple levels of anticipation\n\n5. Risk management:\n   - Given the uncertainty, I should avoid the move that could lose me 3 points (rock)\n   - Playing scissors is less risky (can only lose 1 point if they play rock)\n\n[move] scissors"
