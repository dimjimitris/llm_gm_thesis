    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n\n5.

My total score is now -7 points.\n\n3. My opponent's move frequency:\n   - Rock: 5 times (Rounds 2, 3, 6, 8, 11)\n   - Paper: 3 times (Rounds 1, 5, 10)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (Rounds 4, 7, 9)\n\n4. After playing rock (which they just did), their next moves have been:\n   - After Round 2 (rock), they played rock again\n   - After Round 3 (rock), they played scissors\n   - After Round 6 (rock), they played scissors\n   - After Round 8 (rock), they played scissors\n\n5. 3 out of 4 times, they played scissors after rock, suggesting they might play scissors now.\n\n6. Players often change strategy after losing, so they might deviate from their pattern.\n\n7. They might expect me to follow the natural progression (paper \u2192 scissors) or repeat my winning move.\n\n8. If they play scissors as their pattern suggests, rock would counter effectively.\n\n9. If they try to counter my expected scissors with rock, I'd lose.\n\n10. Given that they follow patterns but also adapt, and considering their tendency to play scissors after rock, I'll play rock to counter their most likely move.\n\n[move] rock"
