Looking at my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose (-1 points)\n\n5.

They've played paper 2/3 times after scissors, suggesting paper may be their most likely next move.\n\n5. My recent moves have been paper \u2192 rock, which might make them think I'll play scissors next.\n\n6. After losing, players often change strategy to break patterns.\n\n7. If they play paper (most statistically likely move), scissors would be the optimal counter.\n\n8. If they anticipate me playing scissors and play rock instead, I would lose points.\n\n9. However, based on their historical tendency and considering they just lost with scissors, paper seems to be their most probable next move.\n\n10.

So there's a higher incentive to play paper if I think my opponent will play rock.\n\nSecond, I need to consider what my opponent might be thinking. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their past behavior or tendencies.\n\nFrom game theory, in a one-shot RPS game with symmetric players, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, given the asymmetric payoffs here (paper beating rock gives 3 points while other wins give 1 point), the expected values change.\n\nLet me calculate the expected value for each move:\n1. If I play rock:\n   - Opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - Opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - Opponent plays rock: 3 points (I win)\n   - Opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - Opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - Opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly. This is because the reward for paper beating rock (3 points) is higher than other winning combinations.\n\nHowever, a strategic opponent might anticipate this and play scissors more often. But since this is a fresh player, I don't have information about their strategic thinking.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest expected value against a random player, I will choose paper as my first move.",

They've played paper 6/7 times after scissors - an extremely strong pattern.\n\n5. My recent moves have been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, showing I'm adapting to their patterns successfully.\n\n6. If they play paper (which seems highly likely based on their pattern after scissors), my optimal counter would be scissors.\n\n7. I've now won twelve of the last thirteen rounds by accurately predicting their moves, showing my pattern recognition strategy is extremely effective.\n\n8.

I need to analyze the scoring system of this rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points (high stakes)\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point (low stakes)\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point (low stakes)\n\n2. Against a fresh player, I should consider what first moves are common:\n   - Many new players choose rock as their first move\n   - The asymmetric scoring makes paper the highest-reward move (3 points)\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I gain 3 points\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point\n\n3. Comparing expected values:\n   - Paper has the best risk-reward ratio (potentially win 3, potentially lose 1)\n   - Rock and scissors both have equal potential gain (1 point) \n   - Rock has the worst potential loss (3 points)\n\n4. Given this is the first round with a new player who might default to rock, paper offers the highest expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Their initial pattern was paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 repeat\n   - Despite one disruption, they appear to have returned to this pattern\n   - If they continue the pattern, they will play rock next\n\n4. Considering the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points (high value)\n   - Risk of playing paper if they choose scissors: lose only 1 point\n   - This offers the best risk-reward ratio\n\n5. With 7 wins out of 9 rounds (plus 2 ties), I've been successful at predicting their moves. Their return to pattern suggests I should play paper to counter their likely rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

In standard rock-paper-scissors, all moves have equal expected value if the opponent plays randomly.\n\n2. However, with this scoring system, the expected values are different:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points if it beats rock)\n   - But paper also has risk (losing 1 point to scissors)\n   - Rock has medium reward potential (1 point if it beats scissors)\n   - Rock has high risk (losing 3 points to paper)\n   - Scissors has medium reward (1 point if it beats paper)\n   - Scissors has medium risk (losing 1 point to rock)\n\n3. Given that I'm playing against a fresh player, I need to consider what they might play:\n   - Many new players tend to play rock as their first move\n   - They might also realize that paper has the highest reward and choose that\n   - If they're strategic, they might anticipate others playing paper and play scissors\n\n4. With the asymmetric scoring, paper seems to have the highest expected value against a random opponent because:\n   - Win against rock: +3 points (high reward)\n   - Lose against scissors: -1 point (low penalty)\n   - Tie against paper: 0 points\n\n5. However, if the opponent is likely to play paper (because of its high potential reward), then scissors would be a good counter.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think playing paper gives me the best expected value in the first round against a fresh player.

Perhaps they're using a more sophisticated strategy to predict what I'll do.\n\nI need to be less predictable. Given the scoring structure:\n- Paper beats rock (3 points vs -3 points)\n- Rock beats scissors (1 point vs -1 point)\n- Scissors beats paper (1 point vs -1 point)\n\nPaper has the highest potential gain but also the highest potential loss. Since I've lost several rounds in a row, I might want to be more conservative with my choice.\n\nInstead of trying to predict their move (which hasn't been working), I'll play paper. The reasoning:\n1. If they play rock, I win 3 points (high gain)\n2. If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point (limited downside)\n3. If they play paper, it's a tie (no loss)\n\nThis gives me a reasonable risk-reward profile to potentially break my losing streak.",

So there's a higher incentive to play paper if I think my opponent will play rock.\n\nSecond, I need to consider what my opponent might be thinking. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their past behavior or tendencies.\n\nFrom game theory, in a one-shot RPS game with symmetric players, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, given the asymmetric payoffs here (paper beating rock gives 3 points while other wins give 1 point), the expected values change.\n\nLet me calculate the expected value for each move:\n1. If I play rock:\n   - Opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - Opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - Opponent plays rock: 3 points (I win)\n   - Opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - Opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - Opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n   - Opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n   If opponent plays each with equal probability (1/3), my expected value is (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly. This is because the reward for paper beating rock (3 points) is higher than other winning combinations.\n\nHowever, a strategic opponent might anticipate this and play scissors more often.

A common pattern is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous move - so they might expect me to play scissors (which beats paper).\n3. To counter scissors, they might choose rock.\n\nGiven this reasoning:\n- If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0 points)\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win (+1 point)\n\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n- If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win (+1 point)\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nThere's a psychological element in this game. After a tie with both playing paper, many opponents would avoid playing paper again and might switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors). If they do play rock, my best move would be paper again, giving me +3 points.\n\nHowever, this is just one possibility. They could also anticipate this thinking and choose scissors instead.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoff structure, paper still has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins, while having a moderate penalty (-1) when it loses. This makes it somewhat attractive despite the risk.\n\nI'll choose rock for this round, as I believe there's a good chance my opponent will expect me to play scissors and therefore play rock themselves.",

This could indicate either:\n1) They're establishing a new pattern\n2) They think I'll expect them to change, so they're repeating\n3) They've found a successful prediction method for my moves\n\nIf they play scissors again, rock would be my best counter. If they switch to rock (anticipating I might play scissors), I should play paper. If they play paper, scissors would be optimal.\n\nGiven that they've now played scissors twice in a row and this is unusual for their pattern, I think rock is my safest play. Rock beats their scissors if they repeat, and ties with rock if they switch to that. The only downside is losing 3 points if they play paper, but they've used paper less frequently than other moves.",

A common reaction after losing would be to play the move that would have beaten their opponent's winning move. Since I played paper, they might play scissors next.\n\nIf they play scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\nHowever, they might also anticipate this adjustment and play paper, expecting my rock. This would be thinking one step further.\n\nGiven that they've been mostly successful against me throughout the game (I've only won 2 out of 11 rounds), they seem to be thinking at least one step ahead. So I should consider what they think I'll play.\n\nThey might reason: \"I just lost to paper with rock. My opponent might expect me to play scissors next to counter their paper, so they'll play rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock.\"\n\nIf this is their reasoning, I should play scissors to beat their anticipated paper.\n\nBut there's also a chance they'll stick with rock again, as it's their most frequently played move.\n\nLet me look at what moves they've played after losses:\n- They lost in Round 7 with scissors, then played rock in Round 8\n- They've only lost twice, so not much pattern to go on\n\nSince rock is their most common move, and they might revert to it after a loss, I think scissors would be too risky. Also, they've beaten my scissors with rock multiple times already.\n\nI think the safest play here, considering their most common move is rock, would be to stick with paper, which just won me points. If they switch to scissors, I lose only 1 point, but if they play rock again (their most common move), I gain 3 points.",
