The payoffs are asymmetric - rock beating paper has a higher reward/penalty (\u00b13 points) than the other outcomes (\u00b11 point).\n\nTo maximize expected value in a one-shot game against an unknown opponent, I should analyze the expected value of each choice assuming random play from my opponent:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses paper: -3 points (I lose)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses scissors: 1 point (I win)\nExpected value = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses rock: 3 points (I win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (I lose)\nExpected value = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses rock: -1 point (I lose)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses paper: 1 point (I win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on pure expected value against random play, paper has the highest expected value (2/3), followed by scissors (0), with rock having the lowest (-2/3).\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my opponent may be strategic rather than random. They might be analyzing the payoffs similarly and could choose scissors expecting me to choose paper.\n\nGiven this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll go with paper, which has the highest expected value against random play.

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost. But the hint says I won. This is inconsistent with the rules.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should have lost. The hint confirms I lost.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. According to the rules, rock beats paper, so I should have lost. The hint confirms I lost.\n\nThere's definitely some inconsistency here. Let me re-examine the rules more carefully...\n\nOh! I see the issue. I misread the rules initially. The correct rules are:\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 5 points and the loser -5 points.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules in the game description say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is definitely inconsistent with the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nI need to understand the actual rules being used here. Let's look at each round again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won, which would be consistent with \"paper beats scissors\" as stated in the rules.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost, which would be consistent with \"paper beats scissors\".\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost, which would be consistent with \"scissors beats rock\" as stated.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost, which would be consistent with \"rock beats paper\" as stated.\n\nSo the rules as stated in the game description are being followed, but they're different from the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n1. Paper beats Scissors (not Rock)\n2. Rock beats Paper (as in traditional)\n3. Scissors beats Rock (not Paper)\n\nLet me try a strategy based on these unusual rules. If my opponent is playing somewhat consistently, I should try to predict their next move based on their pattern so far:\nOpponent has played: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock\n\nThere's no obvious pattern, but they've played scissors twice, rock twice, and paper once. If they're more likely to play scissors or rock, I should play paper (which beats scissors) or scissors (which beats rock).\n\nFor this round, I'll go with scissors since it beats rock and rock has appeared in their pattern recently.",

Let me double check the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner 3 points, loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner 1 point, loser -1 point\n\nSo in Round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors.

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have won, but I lost again.\n\nThere appears to be confusion either in the rule description or in the game implementation.

Let me look at individual rounds again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. This suggests scissors beats rock.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost. This suggests rock beats paper.\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. This suggests paper beats scissors.\n\nWait, let me re-read the rules more carefully:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see the issue now. I was reading \"paper beats scissors\" to mean paper is beaten by scissors, but it actually means paper wins against scissors. With this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point. \u2713\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points. \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost 1 point. \u2713\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost 1 point. \u2713\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost 3 points. \u2713\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost 1 point. \u2713\n\nNow the results make sense. The correct understanding of the rules is:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- Rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nGiven this understanding, let me decide on my next move. I need to predict what my opponent will play.\n\nMy opponent has played: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper.\nThere seems to be a pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\nFollowing this pattern, my opponent might play scissors next.\n\nIf they play scissors, my best move would be paper (paper beats scissors).\n\nLet me go with paper.",

First, let me understand the scoring system:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\nWait, there seems to be a mistake in my understanding or the game rules aren't correctly stated. The typical rock-paper-scissors has:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut the rules given state:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is inconsistent with the standard game.

I think the rules might have been stated incorrectly. Let me infer the actual rules from the outcomes:\n\nWhen I played paper and won against scissors (+1), this suggests paper beats scissors.\nWhen I played rock and won against paper (+3), this suggests rock beats paper.\nWhen I lost with rock against scissors (-1), this suggests scissors beats rock.\n\nSo it seems the actual rules might be:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nBut this is reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors. \n\nLet me re-check rounds 3, 4, 6, and 13 which didn't match my initial understanding:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\nIf paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper), then this makes sense.\n\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\nIf scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors), then this makes sense.\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1)\nAgain, if paper beats scissors, this makes sense.\n\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\nIf scissors beats rock, this makes sense.\n\nSo I think the actual rules are the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nGiven these rules, and looking at my opponent's pattern, it seems they often play rock.

Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince I've been losing with rock against scissors several times, maybe my opponent is expecting me to choose paper next (which would beat rock). If I choose scissors, it might catch them by surprise if they're playing paper.",

In a standard rock-paper-scissors game with symmetric payoffs, all moves would be equally good in the first round.\n\nHowever, with these asymmetric payoffs, there might be a slight edge to one strategy. Let's think through it:\n\n- If I play rock: I get +3 if they play paper, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if they play rock\n- If I play paper: I get +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play rock, 0 if they play paper\n- If I play scissors: I get +1 if they play rock, -1 if they play paper, 0 if they play scissors\n\nSince rock has the highest potential reward but also significant risk, many players might be drawn to it initially. Therefore, scissors might be a good counter. However, this is just speculation.\n\nWithout more information about the opponent, and given that this is the first move, I should make a move that balances potential reward with risk. I'll go with scissors for this first move. It has a moderate upside (+1) if they play rock (which they might due to its high reward potential), and a moderate downside (-1) if they play paper.",

However, with the asymmetric point structure, there might be a slightly better starting strategy.\n\nSince rock has the highest stakes (3 points), my opponent might be less likely to play it due to risk aversion. If they're thinking strategically, they might play paper to counter a potential rock play.\n\nGiven these considerations, I might want to play scissors as my first move, anticipating they might play paper.\n\nHowever, this is just speculation since I have no prior information about my opponent.

According to the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: 1 point to winner, -1 to loser\n- Rock beats paper: 3 points to winner, -3 to loser\n- Scissors beats rock: 1 point to winner, -1 to loser\n\nIn Round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper. But the result says I won. This seems inconsistent with the rules.\n\nIn Round 3, I played scissors, opponent played paper. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, and I should win. But the result says I lost.\n\nIn Round 4, I played rock, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, rock should beat scissors. But the result says I lost.\n\nIt seems like the rules might be inverted or there's some confusion. Let me double-check the initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThese rules are unconventional (normally scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, and rock beats scissors), but let's follow them.\n\nSo reviewing again with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I should win. Result says I won. Correct.\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. Result says tie. Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I should lose. Result says I lost. Correct.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I should lose. Result says I lost. Correct.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I should lose. Result says I lost. Correct.\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I should lose. Result says I lost. Correct.\n\nOK, so these are the actual rules of the game, even though they're different from standard rock-paper-scissors. Given these rules:\n\nPaper beats scissors (paper wins)\nRock beats paper (rock wins)\nScissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nLet me think about my strategy. If we assume my opponent is playing randomly, each move has equal expected value. \n\nLet me think about this more systematically:\n- If I play paper: If opponent plays rock, I lose 3 points. If opponent plays paper, tie. If opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point. Expected value: (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3.\n- If I play rock: If opponent plays rock, tie. If opponent plays paper, I win 3 points. If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point. Expected value: (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = 2/3.\n- If I play scissors: If opponent plays rock, I win 1 point. If opponent plays paper, I lose 1 point. If opponent plays scissors, tie. Expected value: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0.\n\nSo rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nBut I need to consider if the opponent is using a pattern or strategy. Let's look at their moves:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played rock\nRound 3: Opponent played paper\nRound 4: Opponent played scissors\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played paper\n\nThere appears to be a pattern: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper...\nIf this pattern continues, the next move would be scissors.\n\nIf opponent plays scissors next:\n- If I play paper, I win 1 point.\n- If I play rock, it's a tie.\n- If I play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nPaper would be my best move if the pattern continues.",

Let's correct:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (this is correct)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nLet me re-analyze:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point. Correct.\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points. Correct.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost 1 point. Correct.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost 1 point. Correct.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost 3 points. Correct.\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost 1 point. Correct.\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point. Correct.\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost 3 points. Correct.\n\nActually, I'm still confused by the rules. Let me be very precise:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win 3 points\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win 1 point\n\nBut this doesn't match the outcomes. Let me double-check the exact wording...\n\nOh! I think I misunderstood. The rule is stating which move beats which, not who gets points for what. Let me restate:\n- Paper beats rock (paper winner gets 1 point, rock loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats scissors (rock winner gets 3 points, scissors loser gets -3)\n- Scissors beats paper (scissors winner gets 1 point, paper loser gets -1)\n\nNow let's check again:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost. But the system says I won. Still confused.\n\nActually, I think the description has a typo or is very unclear. Let me try to infer the actual rules based on the game outcomes:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point. This suggests scissors beats rock.\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost 3 points. This suggests rock beats paper.\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. This suggests paper beats scissors.\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost 3 points. This suggests rock beats paper.\n\nBased on these outcomes, I think the actual rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n\nGiven these inferred rules, what should I play next? I'll use rock since it gives the highest reward when winning.",

This contradicts the rules.\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I should have won (scissors beats paper), but I lost -1 points?

So the relationships are:\n- paper > scissors\n- rock > paper\n- scissors > rock\n\nThis forms a cycle, and it's different from the typical rock-paper-scissors game where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.\n\nLet me rethink my strategy based on this understanding. Since rock beating paper gives the highest points (+3), I should aim to play rock when I expect the opponent to play paper. Let me go with rock for this round.",

Let me read the rules again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me review the rounds and what I was told:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I was told I won with 1 point. According to rules, paper beats scissors, winner gets 1 point.\nRound 2: Tie with rock.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I was told I lost (-1 point). But scissors should beat paper?\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I was told I lost (-1 point). But rock should beat scissors?\n\nI'm confused about the rules. Let me interpret the outcomes directly from what I was told:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (1 point)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 point)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (1 point)\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (3 points)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points)\n\nIt seems like my understanding of the rules is incorrect. Let me see if I can deduce the actual rules from the outcomes:\n\nRound 1: paper beats scissors (1 point)\nRound 3: paper beats scissors (-1 point for me)\nRound 4: scissors beats rock (-1 point for me)\nRound 5: rock beats paper (-3 points for me)\nRound 6: paper beats scissors (-1 point for me)\nRound 7: paper beats scissors (1 point)\nRound 8: rock beats paper (-3 points for me)\nRound 9: rock beats paper (3 points)\n\nThis is still inconsistent. Let me double check the hints I was given after each move.\n\nRound 1: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\"\nRound 3: \"You lost the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: paper.\"\n\nThese directly contradict each other. In one case paper beats scissors, in another scissors loses to paper.\n\nI think there might be an error in how the game is being scored or reported. But for now, I'll make my best guess for the next round.\n\nLet's look at the pattern of my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: paper\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: rock\nRound 9: paper\nRound 10: scissors\n\nThere seems to be a pattern: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper...

This is inconsistent.\n\n7. Seventh round: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won and scored 1 point.\n   - This matches round 1's outcome.\n\n8.

Twelfth round: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won and scored 3 points.\n   - This matches round 9 but contradicts rounds 5, 8, and 11.\n\nThis is very inconsistent.

I'll make another move based on the original game description, which seems to have rock as a potentially high-value move when it wins.",

I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (scissors beats paper). (+1 for opponent)\n2. I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. (0)\n3. I played scissors, opponent played paper.

I lost (paper beats rock). (+1 for opponent)\n13. I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (rock beats scissors). (+3 for me)\n\nWait, this still doesn't match the outcome descriptions in the messages. Let me try once more with the original rules:\n\n- Paper beats rock: +1/-1 points\n- Rock beats scissors: +3/-3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 points\n\nLet me go through the rounds again and make sure I understand what happened:\n\n1. I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost, -1 points (scissors beats paper).\n   But the hint says I won? This is confusing.\n\nLet me review the game description once more:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n\nWith these rules, in round 1:\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors\n- Paper beats scissors, so I should win and get +1 point\n\nThis matches what the hint said. I think I've been misreading the rules. Let me re-analyze with the correct rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won (+1)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock.

I lost (-3)\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3)\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1)\n\nThis is still confusing. Let me carefully think about each round based on the exact text I see:\n\nRound 1: The hint says I won. I played paper, opponent played scissors.\nRound 2: Tie. Both played rock.\nRound 3: I lost playing scissors against paper.\nRound 4: I lost playing rock against scissors.\nRound 5: I lost playing paper against rock.\nRound 6: I lost playing scissors against paper.\nRound 7: I won playing paper against scissors.\nRound 8: I lost playing paper against rock.\nRound 9: I won playing rock against paper.\nRound 10: Tie. Both played scissors.\nRound 11: I lost playing paper against rock.\nRound 12: I won playing rock against paper.\nRound 13: I lost playing rock against scissors.\n\nThe results are inconsistent with the rules as stated. For example, in rounds 1 and 7, I played paper against scissors and won, but in rounds 3 and 6, I played scissors against paper and lost.\n\nMaybe there's an inversion in how the results are reported? Let me take another approach and assume the reports are accurate but my understanding of the rules is wrong.\n\nIf paper beats scissors (rounds 1, 7), scissors loses to paper (rounds 3, 6), rock loses to scissors (rounds 4, 13), and paper loses to rock (rounds 5, 8, 11), then the actual rules would be:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors loses to paper \n- Rock loses to scissors\n- Paper loses to rock\n\nThis is circular and doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the opponent's moves are being reported incorrectly? Let me try to infer the true rules from the consistent patterns:\n\n- In rounds 9 and 12: I played rock and won against what was reported as \"paper\"\n- In rounds 5, 8, 11: I played paper and lost against what was reported as \"rock\"\n- In rounds 4 and 13: I played rock and lost against what was reported as \"scissors\"\n\nSince there's so much confusion, let me pick scissors for my next move to gather more information.",

But I need to look for patterns in their sequence of moves.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern in how my opponent responds to my moves:\n\nWhen I play paper:\n- Round 1: Opponent plays scissors (I win)\n- Round 5: Opponent plays rock (I lose)\n- Round 7: Opponent plays scissors (I win)\n- Round 8: Opponent plays rock (I lose)\n- Round 11: Opponent plays rock (I lose)\n- Round 14: Opponent plays rock (I lose)\n\nWhen I play rock:\n- Round 2: Opponent plays rock (tie)\n- Round 4: Opponent plays scissors (I lose)\n- Round 9: Opponent plays paper (I win)\n- Round 12: Opponent plays paper (I win)\n- Round 13: Opponent plays scissors (I lose)\n\nWhen I play scissors:\n- Round 3: Opponent plays paper (I lose)\n- Round 6: Opponent plays paper (I lose)\n- Round 10: Opponent plays scissors (tie)\n\nThis is a bit confusing, as my opponent seems to vary their strategy. They've been playing rock quite a bit recently when I play paper (4 out of the last 5 times I played paper).\n\nGiven that I've lost the last round by playing paper against rock, I might want to anticipate that they'll expect me to switch to scissors. If they expect that, they might play rock to counter my scissors. So I could play paper to counter their anticipated rock.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility they'll just continue with rock since it worked last time. In that case, I should play scissors.\n\nLet me try scissors this time.",

Rock should beat scissors.)\n\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost and got -3 points. (This is inconsistent too. Paper should beat rock.)\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost and got -1 points.

I won and got +3 points.\n\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost and got -1 points.\n\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost and got -3 points.\n\nI notice that the results are often inconsistent with the rules described initially. For example:\n\n1. Paper beats scissors (should be scissors beats paper)\n2. Rock beats paper (should be paper beats rock)\n3. Scissors beats rock (should be rock beats scissors)\n\nThis suggests the game rules might be reversed from what was initially stated, or there's some other misunderstanding.\n\nLet me try to infer the actual rules based on the outcomes:\n- When I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (+1)\n- When I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (+3)\n- When I play scissors and opponent plays paper, I lose (-1)\n- When I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I lose (-1)\n- When I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lose (-3)\n\nThis seems to indicate that:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nWhich is exactly the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nLet me double-check the original rules description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see the issue. The rules ARE reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors. In this game:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nNow that I understand the actual rules, let me think about my strategy. My opponent seems to be playing strategically, and I've been losing more than winning.\n\nFor this next move, I'll play scissors. This could beat rock (+1) or lose to paper (-1), so the risk-reward is fairly balanced.",

I was just getting confused in my interpretation.\n\nLet's look for patterns in my opponent's moves:\nRound 1: opponent scissors\nRound 2: opponent rock\nRound 3: opponent paper\nRound 4: opponent scissors\nRound 5: opponent rock\nRound 6: opponent paper\nRound 7: opponent scissors\nRound 8: opponent rock\nRound 9: opponent paper\nRound 10: opponent scissors\nRound 11: opponent rock\nRound 12: opponent paper\nRound 13: opponent scissors\nRound 14: opponent rock\nRound 15: opponent paper\n\nI see it now - my opponent is following a fixed pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper...\n\nFor the next round, based on this pattern, my opponent will play scissors. Against scissors, I should play paper (since paper beats scissors).",

I lost -1 points. (Rock should beat scissors.)\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistency between the rules stated at the beginning and the outcomes described. Let me re-read the original game rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me reinterpret:\n- If you play paper and win against scissors, you get 1 point\n- If you play rock and win against paper, you get 3 points\n- If you play scissors and win against rock, you get 1 point\n\nLet me reanalyze the outcomes with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (Paper beats scissors)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost -1 points. (Paper beats scissors)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost -1 points. (Scissors beats rock)\nRound 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost -3 points. (Rock beats paper)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost -1 points. (Paper beats scissors)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (Paper beats scissors)\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost -3 points. (Rock beats paper)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won 3 points.

(Paper beats scissors)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost -1 points. (Scissors beats rock)\n\nHmm, it still doesn't seem consistent. Let me carefully read the rules again:\n\nWait, I think I was right the first time, but I need to pay attention to who won:\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins)\n\nSo if I play paper and my opponent plays scissors, I would lose (not win). But the system said I won, which contradicts the normal rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nActually, I think there must have been a misstatement in the rules. The traditional rock-paper-scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nLet me try using those traditional rules to analyze the results:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (This doesn't match traditional rules)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost -1 points. (This doesn't match traditional rules)\n\nI'm getting confused by the results. Maybe the rules are actually inverted from traditional RPS? Let me try again with the next move and see what happens.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make a move and see what the outcome is. I'll try scissors.",

I lost (-3)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1)\n\nWait, there seems to be some inconsistency with the game rules or results reporting. Let me revisit the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser -1\n\nIn Round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost. But the result says I won. There might be a miscommunication or the rules were stated incorrectly.\n\nLet me look at more examples to figure out the actual rules:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1). If scissors beats paper, I should have won.\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). If rock beats scissors, I should have won.\n\nI think there's a confusion in how the rules were stated. Let me infer the actual rules from the outcomes:\n\n- If I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won (+1) \u2192 paper beats scissors\n- If I played scissors and opponent played paper, I lost (-1) \u2192 scissors loses to paper\n- If I played rock and opponent played scissors, I lost (-1) \u2192 rock loses to scissors\n- If I played paper and opponent played rock, I lost (-3) \u2192 paper loses to rock\n- If I played rock and opponent played paper, I won (+3) \u2192 rock beats paper\n\nSo it seems the actual rules might be:\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nWith these rules, let me try to identify if there's a pattern in my opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: opponent played scissors\nRound 2: opponent played rock\nRound 3: opponent played paper\nRound 4: opponent played scissors\nRound 5: opponent played rock\nRound 6: opponent played paper\nRound 7: opponent played scissors\nRound 8: opponent played rock\nRound 9: opponent played paper\nRound 10: opponent played scissors\nRound 11: opponent played rock\nRound 12: opponent played paper\nRound 13: opponent played scissors\nRound 14: opponent played rock\nRound 15: opponent played paper\nRound 16: opponent played scissors\n\nIt looks like my opponent might be cycling through scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper... in that order. If that's the case, the next move should be rock.\n\nTo counter rock, I should play scissors since scissors beats rock according to the inferred rules. Let me go with scissors for this round.\n\nActually, I notice I might have misunderstood the outcomes. Let me double-check a few:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Report says I won (+1).\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Report says I won (+1).\n\nIf paper beats scissors, this makes sense. Let me check a few more:\n\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper. Report says I won (+3).\nRound 12: I played rock, opponent played paper. Report says I won (+3).\n\nIf rock beats paper, this doesn't align with what I expected. Let me reread the original rules again:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. I misunderstood. The rules state that paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper), rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. With these correct interpretations, let's reanalyze:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I should have lost, but report says I won. That's inconsistent.\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper. I should have lost, but report says I won. That's also inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the result reporting might be confusing, with the player mentions swapped? Let me assume the reporting is correct and deduce the rules from the outcomes:\n\n- In rounds where I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won. This suggests paper beats scissors.\n- In rounds where I played rock and opponent played paper, I won. This suggests rock beats paper.\n- In rounds where I played scissors and opponent played rock, I lost. This suggests scissors loses to rock (or rock beats scissors).\n\nThis would give:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- rock beats scissors\n\nBut this creates a transitive relationship where rock beats both paper and scissors, which doesn't align with typical rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nI'm still a bit confused about the exact rules and reporting. For now, let me assume the opponent has a pattern of scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper... and respond accordingly.\n\nGiven that the opponent might play rock next, and based on the original rules (where scissors beats rock), I'll play scissors.\n\nActually, I need to double check the most recent rounds to see if the pattern is consistent:\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-3).\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1).\n\nGiven these results, the pattern seems to be rock, paper, scissors. So the next move from the opponent might be rock. \n\nScissors beats rock according to the original rules, so I'll go with scissors.\n\nActually, let me check the reporting one more time:\n- Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost (-3). If rock beats paper (as per the original rules), this is correct.\n- Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost (-1). If paper beats scissors, this is correct.\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1). If scissors beats rock, this is correct.\n\nThese align with the original rules, so I was right the first time. The rules are:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nAnd the opponent's pattern seems to be rock, paper, scissors. So for this round, expecting the opponent to play rock, I should play paper (since paper loses to rock).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If I expect the opponent to play rock, and I want to win, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n\nSo, I'll play scissors for this round.",

Let me try to identify if there's a pattern in my opponent's moves. Looking at my opponent's move history:\n\nScissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock\n\nIt looks like my opponent is playing a simple pattern of \"Scissors, Rock, Paper\" repeatedly. If that's the case, then the optimal strategy would be to play Paper when they play Scissors (I lose), play Scissors when they play Rock (I lose), and play Rock when they play Paper (I win).\n\nGiven this pattern, if they just played Rock in the last round, they should play Paper next. So my best move would be Rock to beat their Paper.\n\nLet me double-check this pattern:\nRound 1: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played Rock\nRound 3: Opponent played Paper\nRound 4: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 5: Opponent played Rock\n... and so on\n\nYes, it does seem like they're following the Scissors-Rock-Paper pattern consistently. In the last round (23), they played Rock. Following the pattern, they should play Paper next. Therefore, I should play Rock.\n\nHowever, given that I've just won using Scissors against their Rock, which breaks the pattern, I should be cautious. There's a possibility they might change their strategy. But without more information, I'll stick with the pattern I've observed and play Rock to counter their expected Paper move.",
