    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent. With paper, you win 3 points against rock, lose only 1 point against scissors, and tie against paper. This asymmetric scoring makes paper statistically favorable as a first move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Many players choose rock as their first move in these games due to psychological comfort. If that's true here, playing paper would be optimal.\n\nRisk Manager: The paper strategy maximizes potential gain (+3) while minimizing potential loss (-1). Rock is high-risk/low-reward (gain 1, lose 3), and scissors has balanced but lower outcomes (gain 1, lose 1).\n\nData Analyst: Without previous moves to analyze, I recommend going with the statistically optimal choice for this first round.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper has the best expected value against a random strategy. As we play more rounds, we can adjust based on the opponent's pattern.\n\n[move] Paper"

We need to predict their likely next move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often switch moves, anticipating their opponent will stay with the same move. Our opponent might expect us to play paper again and switch to scissors to counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: With only one round of data, we can't establish a clear pattern yet, but we should consider the opponent's potential reasoning.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze our options:\n- Playing paper again: Wins 3/loses 1 against rock/scissors\n- Playing scissors: Wins 1/loses 1 against paper/rock\n- Playing rock: Wins 1/loses 3 against scissors/paper\n\nGame Strategist: Since the opponent played paper last round, they might stick with it or switch to scissors anticipating we'll play paper again. Scissors is risky, but rock would be a strong counter to anticipated scissors while only risking 1 point if they stay with paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with rock. It counters the likely scissors play while minimizing our maximum loss compared to other strategies.\n\n[move] Rock"

Both rounds ended in ties, suggesting our opponent may be thinking similarly to us.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two consecutive ties, there's a psychological tendency to break the pattern. Our opponent might predict we'll follow the natural RPS rotation to scissors next, and play rock to counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, they might also follow the clockwise rotation themselves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), which would mean they'll play scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's analyze options again:\n- Paper: High reward (+3) against expected rock, moderate risk (-1) against scissors\n- Rock: Low reward (+1) but also defends against predicted scissors with low risk (-1)\n- Scissors: Risky as opponent might play rock after their last rock move\n\nDecision Analyst: Paper gives us the best expected value. It wins significantly if they stay with rock, and limits our loss if they go with scissors. It's also a pattern break from our last move, which might catch them off guard.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with paper. It has the highest potential payoff while managing risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent seems to be following a classic paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors rotation. If they continue this pattern, they'll play paper next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, after losing a round, players often adjust strategies.

The opponent has played Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper over the last five rounds, showing a clear alternating pattern. If they continue, they should play Scissors next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, they've lost several rounds in a row now. Players typically break patterns after consistent losses, so they might deviate from their alternation strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: If they maintain the alternating pattern and play Scissors, Rock would be optimal (+1). If they break pattern and play Rock (which they haven't played in 4 rounds), Paper would be best (+3).\n\nDecision Analyst: Given their clear pattern but potential for change due to consecutive losses, Rock provides the best expected value. It wins against the most likely move (Scissors) and only risks -1 against Paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock also provides some protection against potential randomization by the opponent.\n\n[move] Rock"

The biggest risk is if they anticipate Paper and play Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Given their adaptability shown by breaking their pattern, I recommend Scissors.

This is significant - they're adapting their strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often switch to what would have beaten their previous move. The opponent might play Paper next, thinking it would have beaten our Rock.\n\nGame Strategist: If they play Paper (which is likely based on both the broken cycle and typical post-tie behavior), Scissors would be optimal.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given their demonstrated adaptability and the recent tie, Scissors has the highest expected value - it beats Paper (their most likely next move) and only risks a small loss against Rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Scissors is the optimal play in this situation.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent matched our Scissors play, reminiscent of their mirroring strategy from rounds 12-15.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After consecutive ties, players typically try to break the pattern. If they believe we'll follow RPS progression and play Rock next, they might play Paper.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect Rock from us and play Paper, Scissors would be optimal. However, they might also be trying to reestablish their mirroring strategy.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the multiple possible strategies the opponent could be using, Paper provides a balanced option - it beats Rock if they return to their cycle or play defensively, and only risks -1 against Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Paper also has the potential for the highest reward (+3) while maintaining a reasonable risk profile.\n\n[move] Paper"
