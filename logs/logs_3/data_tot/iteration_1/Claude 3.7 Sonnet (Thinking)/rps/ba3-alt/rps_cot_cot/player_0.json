    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a new player, I need to consider expected values:\n   - If I play Rock: I win 3 points against Paper, lose 1 against Scissors, tie against Rock\n   - If I play Paper: I win 1 point against Scissors, lose 3 against Rock, tie against Paper\n   - If I play Scissors: I win 1 point against Rock, lose 1 against Paper, tie against Scissors\n\n3. Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1)\n   - Expected value against random play: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n\n4. Paper has moderate reward (+1) but highest risk (-3)\n   - Expected value against random play: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\n5. Scissors has moderate reward and risk (both +1/-1)\n   - Expected value against random play: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\n6. Since Rock has the highest expected value, it's the optimal first move without knowing opponent tendencies.\n\n[move] Rock"

Reassessing the actual game rules (based on outcome):\n   - It appears Rock actually beats Paper (not the other way around)\n   - This gives me 3 points as the winner\n\n3. Planning for this round:\n   - Since my Rock move was successful against their Paper, they might:\n     a) Switch to Rock (thinking I might play Rock again)\n     b) Switch to Scissors (to beat my potential Paper move)\n     c) Stick with Paper (if they're playing randomly)\n\n4. Weighing my options:\n   - If I play Rock again: I'd win against their Paper, tie with Rock, lose to Scissors\n   - If I play Paper: I'd win against Scissors, lose to Rock, tie with Paper\n   - If I play Scissors: I'd win against Rock, lose to Paper, tie with Scissors\n\n5. Since Rock worked last time and has the highest potential payoff, there's value in playing it again, but opponents often change strategy after losing.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Strategic assessment:\n   - Paper has been successful against their Scissors twice in a row\n   - They may finally switch from Scissors after consecutive losses\n   - If they switch to Rock, my Paper would lose\n   - If they switch to Paper, Rock would be optimal\n\n5.
