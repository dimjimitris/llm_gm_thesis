Let me analyze the options:\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: +1 points (I win)\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- If opponent plays Rock: +3 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: -1 points (I lose)\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- If opponent plays Rock: -1 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays Paper: +1 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nThe hint says I'm playing against a fresh player. This likely means they haven't played before and don't have any prior information about my strategy.\n\nIn a standard RPS game without the asymmetric payoffs, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, with these asymmetric payoffs, the Nash equilibrium might be different.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Rock-Paper has the highest point swing (+3/-3)\n- Paper-Scissors and Scissors-Rock have smaller point swings (+1/-1)\n\nSince I don't know anything about my opponent's strategy yet, I could:\n1. Play the move that gives me the best potential upside (Paper, which could win me +3)\n2. Play the move that limits my downside (Scissors, where the worst I can do is -1)\n3. Play randomly to be unpredictable\n\nFor my first move, I think I'll go with Paper. It has the highest potential upside (+3 if opponent plays Rock), and the downside (-1 if opponent plays Scissors) is not as bad as the downside for Rock (-3 if opponent plays Paper).",

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost and received -1 points. However, the hint message says that I won and scored 1 point.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency here. Let me double-check the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nAccording to these rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. But the feedback says I won with paper against scissors.\n\nI think there might be a mistake either in the rules description or in the feedback. Either:\n1. The rules are reversed from what was stated\n2. There was a typo in the feedback message\n\nIf I assume the feedback is correct and the rules description had the paper-scissors relationship backwards, then:\n- paper beats scissors (as confirmed by the feedback)\n- rock beats paper (as stated in the rules)\n- scissors beats rock (as stated in the rules)\n\nThis would create a standard rock-paper-scissors relationship where each move beats one other move and is beaten by one other move.\n\nFor my next move, I'll go with a different choice to gather more information. If the rules are standard rock-paper-scissors but with different point values, then I should mix up my strategy.\n\nI'll choose \"rock\" this time.",

There's no clear pattern yet. I should consider which move gives me the best expected value given the uncertainty.\n\nSince my opponent just played rock, they might anticipate that I'll play paper (to counter their rock).

This suggests rock beats paper.\n\nThere's an inconsistency between rounds 7 and 9. In one case, rock beats paper, and in another, paper beats rock.\n\nLet me double-check the game description again. The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis actually means:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win (paper beats scissors)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win (rock beats paper)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win (scissors beats rock)\n\nThis is completely different from the traditional rock-paper-scissors game!\n\nIn traditional RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nIt's like a reversed or anti-RPS game.\n\nGiven this understanding, let me make a strategic move. In the last round, my opponent played rock. If they keep the same strategy or try to counter my previous move (paper), they might play rock or scissors.\n\nIf they play rock again, and I play rock, it's a tie.\nIf they play rock again, and I play paper, I lose (rock beats paper).\nIf they play rock again, and I play scissors, I win (scissors beats rock).\n\nIf they play scissors (to counter my paper), and I play rock, it's not addressed in the rules.\nIf they play scissors (to counter my paper), and I play paper, I win (paper beats scissors).\nIf they play scissors (to counter my paper), and I play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nGiven these possibilities, playing scissors seems like a reasonable move as it could potentially beat rock, and at worst tie with scissors.\n\nActually, let me re-check my logic again. I think I'm getting confused with the rule description.\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors: paper player gets 1, scissors player gets -1\n- rock beats paper: rock player gets 3, paper player gets -3\n- scissors beats rock: scissors player gets 1, rock player gets -1\n\nBut the outcomes from our games suggest:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I got 1 point.

This aligns with \"rock beats paper\".\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock, I got -3 points. This aligns with \"rock beats paper\".\n\nOk, I think the rules are correct after all.

There are a lot of ties initially, suggesting they might be mirroring my strategy. Then we have some interesting patterns.\n\nLooking at the last few rounds:\n13. I played rock, they played paper, I won (+3) - Wait, this is inconsistent with the payoff rules. If I played rock and they played paper, I should have lost (-3).\n14. I played rock, they played scissors, I lost (-1)\n15. I played paper, they played scissors, I won (+1) - This is also inconsistent. If I played paper and they played scissors, I should have lost.\n16. I played scissors, they played rock, I won (+1) - This is inconsistent too.\n\nI think there might be some confusion in how the results are being reported. Let me double-check the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\nBut the results I'm seeing don't match these rules. It's possible that there's an error in how the game is being scored or reported.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I'll need to make a move based on what seems to be working. Since playing rock has given me positive points multiple times, I'll try that.",

The standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nBut it appears in this variant the rules are reversed or there's some confusion.\n\nGiven the pattern of results, I think the effective rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich means I should continue with the strategy that has been working. My most successful move has been rock, which has given me +3 points multiple times. Let me go with rock again.",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n- Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\nActually, I think there might be a mistake in the rules as stated. The traditional rock-paper-scissors has:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut in the description given:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is a cycle, but it's different from the traditional game. Let me proceed with the rules as given.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, there's no history to base my decision on. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to play randomly with equal probability for each move.\n\nHowever, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating paper gives 3 points, while the other winning conditions only give 1 point. This suggests that rock might be slightly more valuable to play.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If I play rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: 3 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n- If opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf the opponent plays randomly (1/3 probability for each move), my expected value for each move would be:\n- Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n- Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nThis suggests that paper is the optimal move against a random player in this variant, as it has the highest expected value.\n\nBut this is the first move, and the opponent is a fresh player. They might have some initial bias or strategy. A common first move in rock-paper-scissors is rock, as it's often psychologically the first move people think of. If I anticipate this, playing paper would be beneficial.\n\nGiven all this, I'll choose paper as my move.",

In this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo it's a circular relationship but with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nSince the payoffs are asymmetric, there's a strategic element here. Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point.\n\nIf I were to play purely randomly with equal probability for all three moves, the expected value would be 0 in standard rock-paper-scissors. But with these asymmetric payoffs, certain moves might be preferred strategically.\n\nI'm playing against a fresh player who hasn't played before. Without any prior information about their strategy, I could:\n\n1. Play randomly\n2. Play the move that has the highest potential reward (rock)\n3. Play the move that has the lowest potential loss (scissors or paper, which both have -1 as worst-case)\n\nIn game theory, against an unknown opponent in a zero-sum game like this, a mixed strategy is often optimal.

Let me analyze the game structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Tie: no points\n\nWait, I think there's an issue in the game description. It states that \"paper beats scissors\" but traditionally scissors beats paper. Similarly, it states \"rock beats paper\" which is traditional, but then \"scissors beats rock\" which isn't traditional (rock beats scissors normally). So the relationship seems to be:\n\n- Paper < Scissors: scissors wins +1, paper loses -1\n- Rock > Paper: rock wins +3, paper loses -3\n- Scissors < Rock: rock wins +1, scissors loses -1\n\nActually, let me double-check the description again. The description says:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of traditional rock-paper-scissors. In this variant:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper (which is traditional)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nSo the cycle is different than traditional RPS. Let me represent this as a table to clarify the payoffs:\n\n|           | Paper | Rock | Scissors |\n|-----------|-------|------|----------|\n| Paper     | 0,0   | -3,3 | 1,-1     |\n| Rock      | 3,-3  | 0,0  | -1,1     |\n| Scissors  | -1,1  | 1,-1 | 0,0      |\n\nLooking at the table, I see Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Paper and Scissors both have more moderate potential gains/losses (+1/-1).\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no history to analyze. In such a situation, I could:\n\n1. Choose Rock for the highest potential gain, but risk the highest loss\n2. Choose Paper or Scissors for more moderate outcomes\n3. Choose randomly to be unpredictable\n\nRock seems to be the most aggressive move with highest risk/reward. Since this is the first move, I might go with Rock to try for the bigger gain, but I should be prepared to adapt my strategy based on how the opponent plays.\n\nActually, let me think about the Nash equilibrium for this game. In a mixed strategy equilibrium, the expected value of each move should be equal. Let's say the opponent plays Paper, Rock, and Scissors with probabilities p, r, and s respectively (where p + r + s = 1).\n\nExpected value for me playing Paper = 0p + (-3)r + 1s = -3r + s\nExpected value for me playing Rock = 3p + 0r + (-1)s = 3p - s\nExpected value for me playing Scissors = (-1)p + 1r + 0s = -p + r\n\nFor these to be equal:\n-3r + s = 3p - s = -p + r\n\nFrom -3r + s = 3p - s:\n-3r + s = 3p - s\n-3r + 2s = 3p\ns = (3p + 3r)/2\n\nFrom 3p - s = -p + r:\n3p - s = -p + r\n4p - s = r\ns = 4p - r\n\nSo we have:\ns = (3p + 3r)/2\ns = 4p - r\n\nSetting these equal:\n(3p + 3r)/2 = 4p - r\n3p + 3r = 8p - 2r\n3p - 8p = -2r - 3r\n-5p = -5r\np = r\n\nWe also know that p + r + s = 1, so:\np + r + s = 1\np + p + s = 1 (since p = r)\n2p + s = 1\n\nAnd we know that s = (3p + 3r)/2 = (3p + 3p)/2 = 3p:\n2p + 3p = 1\n5p = 1\np = 1/5\n\nSo r = 1/5 as well, and s = 3/5.\n\nThis means in the Nash equilibrium, I should play Paper 1/5 of the time, Rock 1/5 of the time, and Scissors 3/5 of the time.\n\nFor a one-shot game or the first move, it makes sense to follow this mixed strategy. Since Scissors has the highest probability in the equilibrium (3/5), I'll choose Scissors for my first move.",

The rule says paper beats scissors, so I should have won 1 point, which matches.\n\nHmm, there's something strange here. Let me double check my understanding of the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: Paper player gets 1 point, scissors player gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: Rock player gets 3 points, paper player gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Scissors player gets 1 point, rock player gets -1\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me re-read:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo it's:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is the standard rock-paper-scissors game. So:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point.\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper beats rock, so I should have lost 3 points.\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point.\n\nBut the feedback says I won in all these cases. This seems contradictory to the rules.\n\nWait, let me carefully re-read the rules again:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I see. The rules as stated are actually reversed from the standard game. In this version:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the usual scissors cuts paper)\n- Rock beats paper (this matches standard rules)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the usual rock crushes scissors)\n\nSo the cycle is Rock -> Paper -> Scissors -> Rock, rather than the standard Rock -> Scissors -> Paper -> Rock.\n\nGiven this understanding, the results make sense:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point.\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won 3 points.\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be playing with the standard rules in mind, which would explain why they keep making moves that lose to mine according to these modified rules.\n\nFor my next move, I'll choose scissors. If my opponent is using standard rules, they might choose rock (thinking it beats scissors), but in this modified version, scissors beats rock, so I would win.",

Starting from Round 7, it seems like the opponent might be trying to play what would beat my previous move. If that's the case, I should expect them to play paper next (to beat my scissors from Round 10).\n\nIf the opponent is playing to beat my previous move, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nI'll play scissors for the next round.",

The hint says I won +3, which means rock must beat paper.\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors.

The hint says I lost -3, which means rock beats paper.\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. The hint says I won +1, which means scissors beats rock.\n\nOK, this is consistent with the rules provided. So the winning conditions are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nI should aim to play rock when I think my opponent will play paper, as this gives me the most points (+3).

Let me continue with this pattern for my next move.\n\nLooking at my most successful moves, playing rock has yielded the highest points (3 points each time I won). Given the pattern I'm seeing, I'll play rock again, as it seems to consistently beat paper, which my opponent has played multiple times.",

Let me adopt this understanding.\n\nGiven this pattern, my best move would be rock if I think my opponent will play paper, as that gives me the highest points (+3). My second best moves would be paper against scissors or scissors against rock (both +1).\n\nLooking at my opponent's pattern:\n- They've played scissors multiple times\n- They've played paper multiple times\n- They've played rock multiple times\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern to exploit. My best approach might be to focus on the high-reward move (rock) while being cautious of being countered.\n\nLet me choose rock for the next round, as it has the highest potential reward if my opponent plays paper.",

Scissors beats paper, I should have lost. But I won?\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, I should have lost. But I won?\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper beats rock, I should have won. But I lost?\n\nHmm, it seems there might still be confusion about the rules or how the results are being determined. Let me try to identify if there's a pattern in the opponent's moves:\n\nOpponent's moves:\n1: scissors\n2: rock\n3: scissors\n4: paper\n5: rock\n6: scissors\n7: paper\n8: scissors\n9: rock\n10: rock\n11: paper\n12: scissors\n13: paper\n14: scissors\n15: scissors\n16: rock\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern.\n\nLet me focus on what strategy has been most successful for me.

Since the payoffs are misaligned with my understanding of the usual Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, I'll just focus on maximizing expected points based on observed outcomes.\n\nRock seems to be a good choice as it has given me +3 points multiple times.\n\nActually, let me re-examine the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is definitely not the traditional RPS rules. Under these rules:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I should win (+1)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I should win (+3)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I should win (+1)\n\nThis aligns with the results I've seen. So the rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nI'll go with rock for the next move, as it gives the highest potential reward (+3) if the opponent plays paper.",

Their last few moves were:\nRound 15: scissors\nRound 16: rock\nRound 17: paper\n\nIt's interesting that I've been winning quite a lot, which is unusual in rock-paper-scissors where you'd expect closer to a 50% win rate against a random opponent.\n\nLooking at the game theory:\n- rock beats paper (giving 3 points) but loses to scissors (losing 1 point)\n- paper beats scissors (giving 1 point) but loses to rock (losing 3 points)\n- scissors beats rock (giving 1 point) but loses to paper (losing 1 point)\n\nBased on the points structure, rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (3 points). Scissors and paper have lower stakes.\n\nMy opponent's last three moves show a pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they're cycling through in that order, their next move would be scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\nHowever, they might also have noticed I just played rock and won, so they might anticipate I'll play rock again and counter with paper. In that case, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven that I've won several times with rock when they played paper, they might be adapting their strategy to counter rock. So scissors would be a good choice here.\n\nI'll go with scissors for this round.",

The results seem inconsistent with normal rock-paper-scissors rules, where I shouldn't be able to consistently win. Let me check if there's something unusual in the game mechanics or if the opponent is following a predictable pattern.\n\nActually, I just realized there appears to be a mistake in the feedback. The game rules state:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nBut in some rounds, the feedback seems to be reversed from these rules:\n- Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors, I won +1 (this contradicts the rule that scissors beats paper)\n- Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors, I won +1 (same contradiction)\n- Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors, I won +1 (same contradiction)\n\nLet me double-check the rule descriptions again... The rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nAh, I see the issue. The rule description has the relationship backwards for paper and scissors. According to standard rock-paper-scissors rules, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. However, in this game, the rules explicitly state that paper beats scissors.\n\nGiven these modified rules, I should continue using the strategy that has been working well. Rock seems to be a particularly good choice as it gives +3 points when it wins against paper.\n\nFor this next round, I'll choose rock again since it's been successful multiple times.",

Tie (0) - correct\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won (+3) - correct\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1), but the result says I won (+1)? Inconsistent again.\n\nActually, I think I may have misread the rules. Let me re-interpret:\n- paper beats rock (not scissors): paper wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n- rock beats scissors: rock wins (+3), scissors loses (-3)  \n- scissors beats paper: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-1)\n\nThis makes more sense. Let me re-analyze with these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1), but result says won (+1)? Still inconsistent.\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1), but result says won (+3)? Still inconsistent.\n\nLet me just look at what the hint messages say directly:\n\nRound 1: \"You won... paper... opponent... scissors... You scored 1 points.\"\nRound 7: \"You won... rock... opponent... paper... You scored 3 points.\"\nRound 8: \"You won... paper... opponent... scissors... You scored 1 points.\"\n\nI need to determine which of these is actually correct:\n1. \"paper beats scissors\" and \"rock beats paper\" (my first interpretation)\n2. \"paper beats rock\" and \"rock beats scissors\" (my second interpretation)\n\nThe feedback from round 7 (rock vs paper) suggests I won 3 points, which aligns with interpretation 1 where rock beats paper.\n\nFrom round 1 and 8, I played paper vs opponent's scissors and won 1 point, which contradicts both interpretations.\n\nWait, I think I've been reading the rules incorrectly. Let me review again:\n- paper beats scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors loses (-1)\n- rock beats paper: rock wins (+3), paper loses (-3)\n- scissors beats rock: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n\nOk, I think I got it right the first time, but was reading the result messages incorrectly. Let me re-analyze:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Result says I won (+1).\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. Result says I won (+3).\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think about this differently.\n\nLet me look again at what I understand from the game description:\n- paper beats rock (giving the winner +1)\n- rock beats scissors (giving the winner +3)\n- scissors beats paper (giving the winner +1)\n\nAnd reviewing some specific rounds:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. The hint says I won and got +1 points.\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. The hint says I won and got +3 points.\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock. The hint says I lost and got -3 points.\n\nThese results don't align with my understanding of the rules. Let me think...\n\nI think I misread the original rules. Let's try again:\n- paper beats rock (paper +1, rock -1)\n- rock beats scissors (rock +3, scissors -3)\n- scissors beats paper (scissors +1, paper -1)\n\nChecking again:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors should beat paper, but hint says I won (+1).\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper should beat rock, but hint says I won (+3).\n\nI must still be missing something. Let's carefully read the text of the rounds again.\n\nWait a minute. Could it be that the result messages might have mixed up which player made which move? Let me check that possibility:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Result says \"You won... paper... opponent... scissors... scored 1 points.\"\nIf I played scissors and opponent played paper, scissors beats paper giving me +1, which matches.\n\nBut that doesn't match what I submitted. I definitely played paper in Round 1.\n\nActually, I think I've been misreading the rules. The rules say:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors (not rock), rock beats paper, and scissors beats rock. This is rock-paper-scissors but with different point values.\n\nLet me analyze with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, I win (+1) - correct\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, I win (+3) - correct\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock. Paper loses to rock, I lost (-3) - correct\n\nThis makes sense now. I've been playing regular rock-paper-scissors but with different point values.\n\nBased on this, let's make a strategic choice for the next move. The payoff matrix is:\n- Winning with paper against scissors: +1\n- Winning with rock against paper: +3\n- Winning with scissors against rock: +1\n- Losing with paper against rock: -3\n- Losing with scissors against paper: -1\n- Losing with rock against scissors: -1\n\nRock has the highest potential payoff (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). \n\nLet me look at the recent pattern of my opponent:\nRound 14: Opponent played scissors\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\nRound 16: Opponent played rock\nRound 17: Opponent played paper\nRound 18: Opponent played scissors\n\nThere's no clear pattern, but scissors has appeared most recently. If they play scissors again, my best move would be paper.",

Let me double check:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nBut in the report I'm getting, for example in Round 1:\n\"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\"\n\nThis doesn't match the rules stated. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper. But the report says I won with paper against scissors.\n\nLet me re-analyze all rounds with the possibly reversed rules:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 (paper beats scissors)\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won +3 (rock beats paper)\n- Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 (paper beats scissors)\n- Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost -3 (rock beats paper)\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won +1 (scissors beats rock)\n- Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won +3 (rock beats paper)\n- Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won +3 (rock beats paper)\n- Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost -1 (scissors beats rock)\n- Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 (paper beats scissors)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won +1 (scissors beats rock)\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won +3 (rock beats paper)\n- Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost -1 (scissors beats rock)\n- Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 (paper beats scissors)\n\nNow the pattern matches the outcomes correctly. The rules must be:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors\n\nGiven these rules, rock seems to be the strongest move with +3 potential gain, while paper and scissors only offer +1 gain when they win. This makes rock a strong choice.\n\nLooking at my success rate:\n- Rock has won me several +3 games, but I've lost twice with it (-1 each time)\n- Paper has won me several +1 games, but I've lost once with it (-3)\n- Scissors has won me a couple of +1 games\n\nGiven the current pattern, I think rock is still my best bet since it has the highest payoff when it wins.",

Tie (0)\n\nI notice that my results seem inconsistent with the game rules as I understand them. For example, in Round 1, I played paper and opponent played scissors - the rule says scissors beats paper, so I should have lost. But the system said I won. The same inconsistency appears in other rounds.\n\nLet me revisit the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nBased on these rules:\n- When I play paper against scissors, I should win +1 (which matches results)\n- When I play rock against paper, I should win +3 (which matches results)\n- When I play scissors against rock, I should win +1 (which matches results)\n\nIt seems like the rules are inverted from the typical rock-paper-scissors rules, where:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nIn this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven this understanding, let me think about the best strategy. Rock seems to have the highest payoff (winning with rock gives +3), but losing with rock costs only -1, making it potentially advantageous. Scissors can win against rock for +1, but lose to paper for -1. Paper can win against scissors for +1, but lose to rock for -3.\n\nLet's try scissors for this next round.",

Let me review what the problem statement says about the scoring:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1\n\nBut in Round 1, I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won? That doesn't match the rules.\nSame for Round 8, 15, and 19.\n\nOh, I think I may have misinterpreted the rules. Let me re-read:\n\nActually, looking back at the feedback from our games, I think there's a different interpretation:\n- Paper beats ROCK (not scissors)\n- Rock beats SCISSORS (not paper)\n- Scissors beats PAPER (not rock)\n\nThis would be consistent with the traditional rock-paper-scissors game. Let me re-analyze with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I LOST (reported as win with 1 point - seems inconsistent)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points) - consistent\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points) - consistent\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points) - consistent\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points) - consistent\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie (0 points) - consistent\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper, I LOST (reported as win with 3 points - seems inconsistent)\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I LOST (reported as win with 1 point - seems inconsistent)\n\nOK I'm getting confused with the reporting. Let me try to reason through this differently.\n\nThe traditional rock-paper-scissors relationships are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nThe game description states:\n- Paper beats scissors giving winner 1 point and loser -1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving winner 3 points and loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving winner 1 point and loser -1 points\n\nThis seems to reverse the traditional relationships. Let me try to understand what's happening in our games using this rule set.\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point\nRound 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point\nRound 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point\n\nSo it seems the rules are indeed as stated in the game description, which is the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven that understanding, I should continue making strategic choices.\n\nFor the next round, I will choose scissors. It seems that rock is a good choice (it's won me 3 points several times), but it's also lost me points twice. Paper has been a safe choice that has given me a win several times.",

Looking at the payoff structure, winning with rock gives me 3 points, while the other wins only give 1 point. So I should try to win with rock when possible, which means I should try to predict when my opponent will play scissors.\n\nFrom the rounds so far, my opponent seems to have some pattern of repeating my moves at times, but it's not entirely consistent.
