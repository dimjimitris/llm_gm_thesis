Since this is a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy. In standard rock-paper-scissors, if we have no information about the opponent's strategy, all three moves are equally good (or equally random). \n\nHowever, with the modified payoffs, there's a slight strategic difference:\n- Rock has the highest potential payoff (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points)\n- Paper and Scissors both have moderate payoffs/losses (1/-1)\n\nIn this first round with no information, I could:\n1. Choose randomly among the three options\n2. Choose the option that might minimize maximum loss (minimax) - this would suggest paper or scissors since they have lower potential loss\n3. Choose the option that could maximize potential gain - this would suggest rock\n\nSince rock has both the highest potential gain and highest potential loss, it's a risky but potentially rewarding choice. Without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I'll go with rock for this first move. In subsequent rounds, I could adapt based on what I learn about my opponent's strategy.",

According to the rules provided:\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n- But I played rock and my opponent played scissors\n\nThis seems contradictory to the standard rock-paper-scissors rules where rock should beat scissors. Let me double-check the rules again:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nI see! The rules are reversed compared to traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- In this game: paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- In this game: rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- In this game: scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nGiven these rules, I should adjust my strategy. Since my opponent played scissors last time, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked\n2. Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors\n3. Switch to paper to try something new\n\nThe highest payoff move is rock (which beats paper for +3), but if they play scissors again, I'll lose. Paper would beat scissors but lose heavily to rock. Scissors would beat rock but lose to paper.\n\nI'll play paper this time. If they stick with scissors, I win. If they switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors, I still win.

Rock should beat scissors. But the message says I lost, so either the rules were explained incorrectly or there was a mistake.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played paper\n- Opponent played scissors\n- I won (1 point)\n- According to the rules stated initially, paper should lose to scissors, not win. But I won.\n\nLet me re-check the rules from the initial description:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThere seems to be confusion about the rules. The traditional rock-paper-scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the rules given here seem to be different:\n- Paper beats scissors (which is opposite of traditional rules)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (which is opposite of traditional)\n\nGiven these rules and the feedback I received, it seems the rules are being applied as stated in the initial description, not as in traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nSo based on the rules given:\n- If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, scissors beats rock (opponent wins)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, paper beats scissors (I win)\n\nFor the next round, I should consider what my opponent might play. They lost when they played scissors against my paper. They might switch to rock to try to beat my paper.\n\nIf they play rock:\n- If I play rock: tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n- If I play scissors: I win (1 point)\n\nIf they play paper:\n- If I play rock: I win (3 points)\n- If I play paper: tie (0 points)\n- If I play scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n\nIf they play scissors:\n- If I play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n- If I play paper: I win (1 point)\n- If I play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nGiven that the opponent has played scissors twice, they might continue with that strategy or switch. If they continue with scissors, I should play paper. If they switch to rock, I should play scissors. If they switch to paper, I should play rock.\n\nSince I don't know what they'll play, let me go with scissors for this round. It would beat rock if they switch to that, and if they continue with scissors, it would be a tie.",

This seems counterintuitive - if I'm consistently winning with paper, why wouldn't they switch to rock to beat my paper?\n\nWait, I think I've misunderstood the game description. Let me re-read it:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis actually means:\n- Paper LOSES to scissors (paper gets -1, scissors gets +1)\n- Rock LOSES to paper (rock gets -3, paper gets +3)\n- Scissors LOSES to rock (scissors gets -1, rock gets +1)\n\nSo in fact, my opponent has been beating me when they play scissors against my paper. But the feedback says I'm winning... Let me re-examine the description again.\n\nOh, I think I misinterpreted the description. Let's read it again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo paper beats scissors (not the other way around), which gives paper player +1 point and scissors player -1 point.\n\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nRock beats paper, giving rock player +3 points and paper player -3 points.\n\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nScissors beats rock, giving scissors player +1 point and rock player -1 point.\n\nSo we have:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is the correct interpretation, which aligns with the feedback I've been getting.\n\nSo my opponent has been consistently playing scissors, and I've been winning by playing paper. This suggests my opponent has a very fixed strategy or isn't adapting.\n\nSince my paper strategy has been working well for the last 6 rounds, I'll continue with paper for now.",

Let me reconsider the game rules:\n\n- paper beats rock: paper player gets 1 point, rock player gets -1 point\n- rock beats scissors: rock player gets 3 points, scissors player gets -3 points\n- scissors beats paper: scissors player gets 1 point, paper player gets -1 point\n\nSo the payoffs would be:\n- If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays rock: 1 point (I win)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper: -1 point (I lose)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: 3 points (I win)\n\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: 1 point (I win)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nHmm, there is asymmetry in the payoffs. Scissors has high risk, high reward. Rock is safest overall.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no pattern to exploit. Let me look at the expected value of each move assuming the opponent randomly chooses:\n\nFor paper:\n(0 + 1 - 1) / 3 = 0 points expected\n\nFor rock:\n(-1 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points expected\n\nFor scissors:\n(1 - 3 + 0) / 3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points expected\n\nBased on expected value alone, rock seems like the best choice. Let me double-check my math:\n\nPaper EV: (0 + 1 + (-1))/3 = 0/3 = 0\nRock EV: ((-1) + 0 + 3)/3 = 2/3\nScissors EV: (1 + (-3) + 0)/3 = -2/3\n\nSo rock has the highest expected value against a random player. I'll choose rock.\n\nActually, I think I misunderstood again. Let me carefully re-read the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOK, so:\n- paper beats scissors (not rock)\n- rock beats paper (not scissors)\n- scissors beats rock (not paper)\n\nThis seems to be a non-standard rock-paper-scissors game. Let me recalculate:\n\n- If I play paper and opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper: 3 points (I win)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: -1 point (I lose)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: 1 point (I win)\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nNow let's calculate expected values against a random opponent:\n\nPaper EV: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\nRock EV: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\nScissors EV: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nSo with these payoffs, rock has the highest expected value, followed by scissors, then paper. I'll go with rock for my first move.\n\nActually, upon another re-read of the game description, I see this is a complete reversal of standard rock-paper-scissors. In the standard game:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this version:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis creates an interesting strategic situation due to the asymmetric payoffs. Let me recalculate once more:\n\nPaper EV: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\nRock EV: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\nScissors EV: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nGiven these expected values, rock is the optimal choice against a random player. I'll choose rock.",

Let me review the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same moves: tie, no points\n\nThis is an interesting variation of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs. In the standard game, the optimal strategy against a rational player is to choose each move with 1/3 probability. However, with these modified payoffs, the Nash equilibrium might be different.\n\nSince rock beating paper gives the highest payoff (+3/-3), players might be more incentivized to play rock. However, if both players think this way, scissors might be a good counter. But if scissors becomes too common, paper would be the best response.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, they might not have adapted to this payoff structure yet and might play more randomly or stick to traditional rock-paper-scissors strategies.\n\nFor my first move, I think I'll choose scissors. My reasoning:\n1. If the opponent plays rock (which has the highest potential payoff), I would lose but only by a small margin (-1).\n2. If the opponent plays paper (anticipating that I might play rock for the high payoff), I would win by a small margin (+1).\n3. If the opponent plays scissors, it's a tie (0).\n\nSo the expected value seems reasonable, and it's a good starting point to gauge the opponent's strategy.",

The description states:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nThis seems unusual compared to the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors where paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper. Let me double check if I understood correctly:\n\nIf I play paper and opponent plays scissors, then paper beats scissors, so I get +1 point and they get -1 point.\nIf I play rock and opponent plays paper, then rock beats paper, so I get +3 points and they get -3 points.\nIf I play scissors and opponent plays rock, then scissors beats rock, so I get +1 point and they get -1 point.\n\nThis is the reverse of traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors, with different point values.\n\nGiven these modified rules:\n- Rock is strong against paper (highest payoff of +3)\n- Paper is good against scissors (+1)\n- Scissors is good against rock (+1)\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history to analyze, I need to make a strategic first move. Let's think about the expected value of each move:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: +3 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n- If opponent plays paper: +1 point (I win)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nAssuming the opponent picks randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n- Expected value of rock = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Expected value of paper = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n- Expected value of scissors = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a random player. I'll choose paper as my move.\n\nActually, wait. I need to double-check my understanding of the rules again, as they seem counterintuitive. The description states:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n\nThis wording is ambiguous. Let me interpret it another way:\n\n- When paper plays against scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors loses (-1)\n- When rock plays against paper: rock wins (+3), paper loses (-3)\n- When scissors plays against rock: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the wording, but it reverses the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors cycle. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf I play rock:\n- vs rock: 0 points (tie)\n- vs paper: +3 points (I win)\n- vs scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I play paper:\n- vs rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- vs paper: 0 points (tie)\n- vs scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- vs rock: +1 point (I win)\n- vs paper: -1 point (I lose)\n- vs scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nAssuming random opponent moves:\n- Expected value of rock = (0 + 3 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n- Expected value of paper = ((-3) + 0 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n- Expected value of scissors = (1 + (-1) + 0)/3 = 0\n\nUnder this interpretation, rock has the highest expected value. \n\nActually, let's look at the problem statement one more time to make sure we understand it correctly:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nThis is saying that paper beats scissors, and paper (the winner) gets +1 point while scissors (the loser) gets -1 points.\n\nBut this is the opposite of traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors where scissors beats paper! So this game has reversed the traditional winning relationships, making it:\n- Paper beats scissors (instead of scissors beating paper)\n- Rock beats paper (instead of paper beating rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (instead of rock beating scissors)\n\nSo my second interpretation was correct. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player, so I'll choose rock.",

Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games. If this is true, I should choose Paper to counter that tendency.\n\nBut also note that the payoffs are asymmetric. Rock beating scissors gives 3 points, while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This makes Rock potentially more valuable if I can predict when my opponent will play Scissors.\n\nSince I don't have any historical data about my opponent, and this is the first move, I'll choose Paper as my opening move. It counters the common first-move Rock, and the penalty for being wrong (-1 against Scissors) is less severe than the penalty for a wrong Rock move (-3 against Paper).\n\nThe move I'll make is Paper.",

According to the description, paper beats scissors, but in Round 2 I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won. This contradicts the rule that says paper beats scissors. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. The classic game is:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nI think there may be a mistake in the game description. Let's assume the correct rules are:\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThis would make more sense with the feedback I've received so far.\n\nLet's review the rounds again with the corrected rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I should have won (rock beats scissors), but the feedback says I lost. This is inconsistent.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I should have lost (scissors beats paper), and the feedback says I won. This is inconsistent.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points. This is consistent.\n\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points. This is consistent.\n\nThere seem to be inconsistencies in the feedback. Let me try to infer the actual rules based on the feedback:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost. This suggests scissors beats rock.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won. This suggests paper beats scissors.\n\nThese inferred rules contradict each other or the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me continue playing and see if I can figure out the actual rules.\n\nFor this next round, I'll play rock, which should give me more information.",

The rules are:\n- Paper loses to scissors\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nActually, reading it again:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper winner +1, scissors loser -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock winner +3, paper loser -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors winner +1, rock loser -1)\n\nSo scissors beats rock, and rock beats paper, and paper beats scissors. \n\nWith this correct understanding, let's reassess:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I should have lost (scissors beats rock), and I did lose.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I should have won (paper beats scissors), and I did win.\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I should have lost (scissors beats rock), and I did lose.\n\nOk, now this makes sense. My opponent has played scissors 4 times and paper 2 times. They seem to favor scissors.\n\nGiven that paper beats scissors, and my opponent plays scissors frequently, I should play paper again.",

Based on \"paper beats scissors\", I won correctly.\n\nSo the rules as stated are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the standard rock-paper-scissors game but with the directions reversed from what's commonly known.\n\nGiven this understanding, let me look at my opponent's pattern again:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: scissors\nRound 3: scissors\nRound 4: paper\nRound 5: scissors\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: scissors\nRound 9: rock\n\nThey play scissors most often, followed by paper, and rarely rock. The best counter to scissors (according to the rules given) is paper. However, scissors is also a good choice as my opponent rarely plays rock.\n\nI think I'll go with paper for this round, as it would beat scissors which my opponent plays most frequently.",

So the correct rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock +3, paper -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n\nThis creates a rock-paper-scissors cycle but with asymmetric payoffs.\n\nNow, looking at my opponent's pattern again (heavy preference for scissors), my best move would be paper, as it beats scissors.",

Inconsistent.\n\nIt seems like there may be an inconsistency or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me try once more, very carefully:\nRule says: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means paper wins against scissors.\n\nRule says: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\nThis means rock wins against paper.\n\nRule says: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means scissors wins against rock.\n\nSo it's:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nBut this creates a cycle where no single move is best, which is typical for rock-paper-scissors. However, the points are different.\n\nNow let's check the results:\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. According to rules, scissors beats rock, so I should lose (-1). The result says I lost (-1). Consistent.\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. According to rules, paper beats scissors, so I should win (+1). The result says I won (+1). Consistent.\n\nSo it seems the rules are reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats Paper (traditional)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not the other way around)\n\nBased on this pattern:\n- If I play Paper against Scissors, I win\n- If I play Rock against Scissors, I lose\n- When we both play the same move, it's a tie\n\nLooking at more rounds:\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie. Consistent.\nRound 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie. Consistent.\nRound 5: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I lost (-1). Consistent with scissors beating rock.\n\nIt seems my opponent has been playing Scissors a lot. Let me check their pattern:\nRound 1: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 3: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 4: Opponent played Paper\nRound 5: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 6: Opponent played Paper\nRound 7: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 8: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 9: Opponent played Rock\nRound 10: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 11: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 12: Opponent played Scissors\nRound 13: Opponent played Scissors\n\nThe opponent has played:\n- Scissors: 10 times\n- Paper: 2 times\n- Rock: 1 time\n\nThey have a strong bias toward playing Scissors. Given that Paper beats Scissors in this game, playing Paper seems to be the optimal strategy.\n\nSo for this round, I'll play Paper again.",

The rules say \"paper beats scissors\" but also that \"rock beats paper\" and \"scissors beats rock\". This doesn't match the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules where paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper.\n\nLet me reconsider the rules:\n- If paper beats scissors (winner 1, loser -1)\n- If rock beats paper (winner 3, loser -3)\n- If scissors beats rock (winner 1, loser -1)\n\nSo in this version:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nOk, so I need to adjust my strategy.

Let me try to understand what's happening:\n\n1. The rules might be stated in reverse (i.e., when it says \"paper beats scissors\" it means scissors beats paper)\n2. There might be a mistake in the results\n\nBased on the consistent pattern of results, it seems like:\n- Paper beats scissors (I win when I play paper vs scissors)\n- Scissors beats rock (I lose when I play rock vs scissors)\n\nThis would mean the rules are actually:\nPaper > Scissors\nScissors > Rock\nRock > Paper (this last one is inferred)\n\nWhich is more like the traditional game but with the wording reversed in the instructions.\n\nGiven this understanding and the opponent's tendency to play scissors, I should continue playing paper since it seems to be winning against scissors.",

This seems counterintuitive - if I'm consistently winning with paper, why wouldn't they switch to rock to beat my paper?\n\nWait, I think I've misunderstood the game description. Let me re-read it:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis actually means:\n- Paper LOSES to scissors (paper gets -1, scissors gets +1)\n- Rock LOSES to paper (rock gets -3, paper gets +3)\n- Scissors LOSES to rock (scissors gets -1, rock gets +1)\n\nSo in fact, my opponent has been beating me when they play scissors against my paper. But the feedback says I'm winning... Let me re-examine the description again.\n\nOh, I think I misinterpreted the description. Let's read it again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo paper beats scissors (not the other way around), which gives paper player +1 point and scissors player -1 point.\n\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n\nRock beats paper, giving rock player +3 points and paper player -3 points.\n\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nScissors beats rock, giving scissors player +1 point and rock player -1 point.\n\nSo we have:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is the correct interpretation, which aligns with the feedback I've been getting.\n\nSo my opponent has been consistently playing scissors, and I've been winning by playing paper. This suggests my opponent has a very fixed strategy or isn't adapting.\n\nSince my paper strategy has been working well for the last 6 rounds, I'll continue with paper for now.",

This is what I was doing in the later rounds when I won several times in a row.\n\nHowever, the opponent might be trying to adapt to my strategy, as shown in round 19 when they played rock (which beats paper). So I should be careful about being too predictable.\n\nFor the next round, I'm going to continue with the paper strategy since it has been working well overall, but I should be prepared to adapt if the opponent continues to mix in more rock plays.",
