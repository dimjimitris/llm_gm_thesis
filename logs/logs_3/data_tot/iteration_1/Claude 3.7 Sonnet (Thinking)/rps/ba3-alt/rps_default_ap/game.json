The normal cycle is broken (paper beats scissors, which is opposite of standard rules)\n2. The payoffs are asymmetric (rock beating paper gives higher points than the other victories)\n\nLet me analyze the payoff matrix for this game:\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays scissors: +1 points (I win)\nExpected value if all moves are equally likely: (-3 + 0 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If opponent plays paper: +3 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 points (I lose)\nExpected value if all moves are equally likely: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If opponent plays paper: -1 points (I lose)\n- If opponent plays rock: +1 points (I win)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value if all moves are equally likely: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nFrom this analysis, if my opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3), my best move would be rock, with an expected value of +2/3. Scissors would be my second choice with an expected value of 0, and paper would be my worst choice with an expected value of -2/3.\n\nSince this is the first move and I don't have any information about my opponent's tendencies, I will go with rock as it has the highest expected value against a random player.",

Let me re-read the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. According to the rules, rock beats paper (not the other way around). So I did win by playing rock against paper, and I got 3 points for that.\n\nNow I need to make my next move. Since I had success with rock last time, my opponent might expect me to play rock again. They might switch to scissors to counter my rock. If they do that, I should play paper to counter their scissors.\n\nLet me go with paper for this round.",

Scissors should beat paper, so my opponent should have won. But the hint says I won with 1 point.\n\nThese outcomes seem to contradict the rules. It's possible that:\n1. The rules were misinterpreted or misstated\n2. The moves are being recorded or interpreted differently than what I think\n3. The win/loss condition might be reversed (i.e., the rule might actually be \"paper loses to scissors\" etc.)\n\nBased on the actual outcomes:\n- When I played rock vs paper, I won with 3 points\n- When I played paper vs scissors, I won with 1 point\n\nThis suggests the actual rules might be:\n- rock beats paper (3 points)\n- paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- and presumably scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nLet me try playing scissors this time to see what happens.

Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point.\nBut it says I won 1 point.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between the game rules and the reported outcomes. Let me go back and reread the rules.\n\nLooking at the description, I see:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nI think there's an error in my original understanding.

Let me check the feedback I've been getting:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nIf rock beats paper, then this makes sense.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors, then this makes sense.\n\nIt seems like the rules as implemented are:\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n\nThis is different from the typical rock-paper-scissors rules, but it seems to be consistent with the feedback I've been getting.\n\nLet me check a few more rounds:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\nIf scissors beats rock, this is consistent.\n\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors, this is consistent.\n\nSo the rules seem to be:\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\nLooking at my opponent's pattern, they seem to be playing scissors quite frequently. Since rock beats scissors, I might want to play rock for this round.\n\nActually, wait - I need to reexamine the rules and outcomes more carefully.\n\nLet me look at each round again:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n\nIf the standard rock-paper-scissors rules apply (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock), then all these outcomes are backward. Let me check the game description again.\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nThese are indeed different from standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me check the results again:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nIf rock beats paper (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\nIf scissors beats rock (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nSo the cyclic dominance is:\nrock > paper > scissors > rock\n\nThis is consistent with the outcomes I've been seeing.\n\nLooking at my opponent's recent moves, they've played scissors in rounds 14, 15, and 17, and scissors in rounds 10, 12, and 15.

(Wait, there seems to be a contradiction here. Rock should lose to paper, not win. But let me continue tracking.)\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (Again, paper should lose to scissors, not win.)\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point. (Scissors should lose to rock, not win.)\n\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point.\n\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost 1 point. (Scissors should beat paper, not lose.)\n\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won 3 points.\n\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won 3 points.\n\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point. (Rock should beat scissors, not lose.)\n\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point. (Rock should beat scissors, not lose.)\n\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point. (Rock should beat scissors, not lose.)\n\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (Paper should lose to scissors, not win.)\n\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point. (Rock should beat scissors, not lose.)\n\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point. (Paper should lose to scissors, not win.)\n\nRound 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\nRound 21: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost 3 points. (Paper should beat rock, not lose.)\n\nRound 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won 1 point. (Scissors should lose to rock, not win.)\n\nRound 23: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost 3 points. (Paper should beat rock, not lose.)\n\nI notice that the outcomes seem to be opposite of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game. Here it seems:\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nSo for my next move, I should consider what my opponent might play and choose accordingly. Based on recent moves, my opponent played rock twice recently. I'm going to play scissors to try to win against rock.",

Let me restate the rules from the beginning:\n\n- paper beats scissors: If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I get 1 point and they get -1 point.\n- rock beats paper: If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I get 3 points and they get -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock: If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I get 1 point and they get -1 point.\n\nSo the winning combinations are:\n- Paper beats scissors (non-standard)\n- Rock beats paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (non-standard)\n\nWith these rules, the expected values are:\n- If I play paper: I win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n- If I play rock: I win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie with rock (0)\n- If I play scissors: I win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nThis is a circular relationship like traditional RPS, but with different strengths.\n\nExpected values:\n- Paper: (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67\n- Rock: (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67\n- Scissors: (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected value, rock seems to be the best choice.

This is a classic game theory scenario where there's no consistently dominant strategy.\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I'll choose rock as it has the highest expected value.

Given these reversed rules, let's re-analyze:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won 3 points.\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point.\n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won 1 point.\n- Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors beats rock, so I won 1 point.\n\nThis makes sense with the feedback I received. So it seems the game is using a reversed version of the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\nGiven this understanding, for the next round:\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win 3 points\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win 1 point\n\nSince I've won with scissors twice in a row, my opponent might anticipate this and choose paper next to counter it. If they play paper, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n\nI'll go with rock for this round.",

If I want to maximize points, playing rock when I expect opponent to play paper gives me the highest reward (3 points).\n\nI'll try paper this time, anticipating they might play scissors based on their previous patterns.",

Paper beats rock, I win 1 point. \u2713\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent actually played paper. Scissors beats paper, I win 1 point. \u2713\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent actually played paper. Scissors beats paper, I win 1 point. \u2713\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent actually played rock. Rock beats scissors, I lose 1 point. \u2713\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent actually played scissors. Rock beats scissors, I win 3 points. \u2713\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent actually played paper. Tie, 0 points. \u2713\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent actually played scissors. Rock beats scissors, I win 3 points. \u2713\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent actually played paper. Paper beats rock, I lose 1 point. \u2713\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent actually played scissors. Tie, 0 points. \u2713\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent actually played paper. Paper beats rock, I lose 1 point. \u2713\n\nThis interpretation makes sense with the traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules and the given point values. It seems like the opponent's move is being reported incorrectly in the hints.\n\nGiven that understanding, I'll plan my next move. Rock has been a good choice for me (3 wins, 2 losses), but scissors has also been decent (2 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie). Paper has been my least played (1 win, 0 losses, 1 tie).\n\nI'll go with scissors this time, as it seems the opponent might play paper frequently.",

Let me check the other rounds...\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point, not won 1 point.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. According to the rules, rock beats scissors, so I should have lost 1 point, not won 1 point.\n\nI think the result reporting has the winner/loser reversed. Let me assume:\n- When it says \"You won\", it means I actually lost\n- When it says \"You lost\", it means I actually won\n\nWith this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost 3 points (reported as won)\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point (reported as won)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost 1 point (reported as won)\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost 1 point (reported as won)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point (reported as lost)\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost 3 points (reported as won)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie 0 points (correctly reported)\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost 3 points (reported as won)\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point (reported as lost)\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie 0 points (correctly reported)\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point (reported as lost)\n\nActually, looking at the results again, I think there's something else happening. Let me look at the stated rules one more time:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nSo it says paper beats scissors, which is different from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me apply these rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I beat the opponent with rock > paper, I won 3 points\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I beat the opponent with paper > scissors, I won 1 point\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I beat the opponent with scissors > rock, I won 1 point\n\nThat matches the reported results. So the rules are reversed from standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nLet me continue applying this interpretation:\n\nRound 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won with scissors > rock, 1 point\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost since paper > scissors, -1 point\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won with rock > paper, 3 points\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie 0 points\nRound 8: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won with rock > paper, 3 points\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost since scissors > rock, -1 point\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie 0 points\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost since scissors > rock, -1 point\n\nSo the rules are:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nBased on this understanding, scissors has been working quite well for me.

Let me correct:\n- paper beats ROCK (not scissors)\n- rock beats SCISSORS (not paper)\n- scissors beats PAPER (not rock)\n\nSo the correct analysis is:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper beats rock, I lost.\nBut the hint says I won with rock vs paper and scored 3 points.\n\nThis seems to contradict the rules as described. Let me look more carefully at the actual results from the hints:\n\nRound 1: Rock vs paper = I won 3 points\nRound 2: Paper vs scissors = I won 1 point\nRound 3: Scissors vs rock = I won 1 point\nRound 4: Scissors vs rock = I won 1 point\nRound 5: Scissors vs paper = I lost 1 point\nRound 6: Rock vs paper = I won 3 points\nRound 7: Paper vs paper = Tie, 0 points\nRound 8: Rock vs paper = I won 3 points\nRound 9: Rock vs scissors = I lost 1 point\nRound 10: Scissors vs scissors = Tie, 0 points\nRound 11: Rock vs scissors = I lost 1 point\nRound 12: Scissors vs scissors = Tie, 0 points\n\nSo based on these results:\n- Rock beats paper (3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nThis is opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules, but I'll go with what the game results show.\n\nNow, for my next move, let me think about what has worked well so far. Rock has given me 3 points when I've won with it, while paper and scissors only give 1 point when winning. The opponent seems to choose scissors frequently (in 4 out of 12 rounds), so playing paper might be a good choice.",

Let me assume the actual rules are:\n\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWith these reversed rules:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. I would lose 3 points. But hint says I won.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I would lose 1 point. But hint says I won.\n\nThere seems to be confusion in either the rule statement or the reporting of results.\n\nOne more attempt - let me assume the feedback is accurate but the description of the moves is reversed:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. The hint says I won 3 points. This would make sense if rock beats paper.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. The hint says I won 1 point. This would make sense if paper beats scissors.\n\nSo the actual rules might be:\n- rock beats paper (3 points)\n- paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nThis seems consistent with the reported outcomes. Let me use this understanding for my next move.\n\nGiven my understanding of the actual rules:\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 3, loser loses 3)\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1, loser loses 1)\n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1, loser loses 1)\n\nBased on this pattern, rock seems to have the highest reward if it wins, so it might be a good strategic choice. Let me go with paper for this round.",

Let me recheck my understanding of the game rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nLooking at my results:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper beats rock, so I should have lost 3 points.\nBut it says I won 3 points. This is confusing.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point.\nBut it says I won 1 point.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between the game rules and the reported outcomes. Let me go back and reread the rules.\n\nLooking at the description, I see:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nI think there's an error in my original understanding. Let's correct it:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (not paper beats rock)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me check the feedback I've been getting:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nIf rock beats paper, then this makes sense.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors, then this makes sense.\n\nIt seems like the rules as implemented are:\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n\nThis is different from the typical rock-paper-scissors rules, but it seems to be consistent with the feedback I've been getting.\n\nLet me check a few more rounds:\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\nIf scissors beats rock, this is consistent.\n\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors, this is consistent.\n\nSo the rules seem to be:\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\nLooking at my opponent's pattern, they seem to be playing scissors quite frequently. Since rock beats scissors, I might want to play rock for this round.\n\nActually, wait - I need to reexamine the rules and outcomes more carefully.\n\nLet me look at each round again:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n\nIf the standard rock-paper-scissors rules apply (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock), then all these outcomes are backward. Let me check the game description again.\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nThese are indeed different from standard rock-paper-scissors rules. Let me check the results again:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\nIf rock beats paper (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\nIf paper beats scissors (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\nIf scissors beats rock (as per the rules), then this is consistent.\n\nSo the cyclic dominance is:\nrock > paper > scissors > rock\n\nThis is consistent with the outcomes I've been seeing.\n\nLooking at my opponent's recent moves, they've played scissors in rounds 14, 15, and 17, and scissors in rounds 10, 12, and 15. They seem to favor scissors. Since paper beats scissors in this variant, I'll play paper for this round.",

You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense if paper beats rock. Unless... the messages are flipped? Let me reread the game description...\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in how the results are being reported.

It appears that in this version:\n- Rock beats paper (giving 3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (giving 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (giving 1 point)\n\nBased on this understanding and my opponent's behavior (they seem to play scissors quite frequently), I'll choose paper for this round.",

Let me double check the pattern:\n\nWhen I play paper against scissors, I keep winning 1 point.\nWhen I play rock against scissors, I keep losing 1 point.\n\nIt seems like there might be a miscommunication in how the rules are being applied. Either the rules were stated incorrectly, or the feedback is inconsistent with the rules.\n\nGiven the consistent feedback pattern, I should continue to play based on what's been working:\n- Paper against scissors seems to win me 1 point\n- Rock against paper seems to win me 3 points\n\nLet me try to continue with paper, since it's been consistently winning me points in recent rounds.",

For example:\n- Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. According to the rules, paper beats rock, so I should have lost 3 points. But it says I won 3 points.\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point. But it says I won 1 point.\n\nIt seems like the scoring results might be reversed or there's some confusion in the game mechanics. Let me try to reason through this.\n\nActually, I think the results being reported to me might have my move and my opponent's move swapped. That would explain the contradiction. Let me reinterpret:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won 3 points.\nRound 2: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won 1 point.\nRound 3: Opponent played scissors, I played rock, I won 1 point.\n...and so on.\n\nThis interpretation matches the scoring rules better. If that's the case, my opponent seems to be cycling through rock, paper, scissors in that order. \n\nBut looking at recent rounds, they've been consistently playing scissors, and I've been winning with paper (which beats scissors according to the stated rules). Let me continue with paper since it's been working well.",

In the second round, I played paper, opponent played scissors. The hint says I won and scored 1 point. But scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point.\n\n3. In the third round, I played scissors, opponent played rock. The hint says I won and scored 1 point. But rock beats scissors, so I should have lost 1 point.\n\nIt seems like the results are consistently reporting the opposite of what they should be based on the rules provided. Let me review the rules again:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point (winner is paper)\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points (winner is rock)\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point (winner is scissors)\n\nThese rules are backwards from the traditional rock-paper-scissors. In traditional RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut here:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo it's like a reversed RPS. Given this pattern and the strange reporting, I need to be strategic.\n\nLooking at my history and the reported outcomes:\n- When I play rock, I seem to win when opponent plays paper (3 points) or lose when opponent plays scissors (-1)\n- When I play paper, I win when opponent plays scissors (1 point) or lose when opponent plays rock (-3)\n- When I play scissors, I win when opponent plays rock (1 point) or lose when opponent plays paper (-1)\n\nMy opponent might be using a strategy. Let me analyze their moves:\nRound 1: They played paper (I played rock)\nRound 2: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 3: They played rock (I played scissors)\nRound 4: They played rock (I played scissors)\nRound 5: They played paper (I played scissors)\nRound 6: They played paper (I played rock)\nRound 7: They played paper (I played paper)\nRound 8: They played paper (I played rock)\nRound 9: They played scissors (I played rock)\nRound 10: They played scissors (I played scissors)\nRound 11: They played scissors (I played rock)\nRound 12: They played scissors (I played scissors)\nRound 13: They played scissors (I played rock)\nRound 14: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 15: They played scissors (I played scissors)\nRound 16: They played scissors (I played rock)\nRound 17: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 18: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 19: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 20: They played scissors (I played paper)\nRound 21: They played rock (I played paper)\n\nLooking at this pattern, my opponent seems to have a preference for scissors lately. Paper has been working well for me recently (I won several rounds with it), but just now they switched to rock and I lost 3 points.\n\nBased on my recent success with paper and their switch to rock, I'll try scissors this time, which should beat rock and give me 1 point.",

Paper beats rock, so I lost 1 point, not won 3 points.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats paper, so I lost 1 point, not won 1 point.\n\nThis doesn't match what I was told in the results. Let me re-review the rules carefully.\n\nActually, I think the results are being reported incorrectly. Let me reconsider the rules:\n\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors) giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper) giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock) giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point\n\nBased on these rules:\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. Paper beats rock, so I should have lost 1 point and opponent gained 1 point.\n\nBut the system reported: \"You won the round. You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\nThis contradicts the rules as stated. Either the rules were stated incorrectly, or the results are being reported incorrectly.\n\nI need to proceed with caution and observe the pattern in the results I'm getting to determine the actual rules being used.\n\nBased on the results I'm seeing:\n- When I play rock against paper, I win 3 points\n- When I play paper against scissors, I win 1 point\n- When I play scissors against rock, I win 1 point\n\nThis seems to be exactly the reverse of what was stated in the rules. Let's continue with this understanding of the actual rules:\n\n- Rock beats paper (winner gets 3 points)\n- Paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point)\n\nGiven this pattern, I'll choose my next move strategically. My opponent has played rock several times recently, so playing scissors would be advantageous.",

I'll go with this understanding.\n\nThe opponent seems to be alternating between paper, scissors, and rock, though not in a completely predictable pattern. If I want to maximize my points, playing rock gives the highest reward (3 points when beating paper), so that would be a good choice, especially if I think they might play paper.\n\nLet me try rock for this round.",
