I've now lost 4 consecutive rounds, indicating my strategy needs significant adjustment.\n\n4. Looking more carefully at my opponent's moves, I notice they follow a clearer pattern than I initially thought:\n   - Rounds 1, 3, 6, 9, 12: Rock\n   - Rounds 2, 5, 7, 10: Paper\n   - Rounds 4, 8, 11: Scissors\n\n5. This suggests they're cycling through a sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors...\n\n6. If this pattern holds, their next move would be paper.\n\n7.

According to the rules stated:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I played rock and my opponent played paper, paper should beat rock. I should have lost 3 points, not won 3 points. There seems to be confusion in the game results.\n\nLet me review the history and rules again:\n\nThe stated rules are:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is strange.

Let me think about what's happening:\n\nIf I've been winning consistently by predicting their pattern, and the game says I'm winning when playing rock against paper, then the actual rule implementation must be:\n- rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is the opposite of standard RPS rules.

Based on the game description:\n- Paper beats scissors: 1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: 3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats rock: 1 point for winner, -1 for loser\n\nHowever, the feedback for rounds 2, 10, and 13 says I won with paper against scissors (which doesn't match the rules as described). Similarly, in round 11, I'm told I won with scissors against rock.\n\nThis suggests either:\n1. I misunderstood the rules\n2. The feedback has the moves reversed\n3. There's some other factor at play\n\nLet me reconsider the rules as described:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper winner: 1, scissors loser: -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock winner: 3, paper loser: -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors winner: 1, rock loser: -1)\n\nActually, I think I got the rules backwards. Let me correct:\n- Scissors beats paper (scissors winner: 1, paper loser: -1)\n- Paper beats rock (paper winner: 3, rock loser: -3)\n- Rock beats scissors (rock winner: 1, scissors loser: -1)\n\nThis makes more sense with the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. With this interpretation:\n\nIn rounds 2, 10, and 13 where I played paper and opponent played scissors, I should have lost, not won.\nIn round 11 where I played scissors and opponent played rock, I should have lost, not won.\n\nThere's definitely something unusual in how the game is being reported or played. Since I'm being told I'm winning in scenarios where I should be losing according to the rules as described, I'll continue making my move but keep this discrepancy in mind.\n\nFor this round, I'll choose scissors again to see what happens.",

And in round 6, I played rock and opponent played scissors - I should have won since rock beats scissors, but it says I lost.\n\nLet me re-read the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh, I see. The description has the beaten move first, not the winning move. So:\n- Paper LOSES TO scissors (scissors beats paper)\n- Rock LOSES TO paper (paper beats rock)\n- Scissors LOSES TO rock (rock beats scissors)\n\nSo let me re-interpret the results:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. 0 points.\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost. +1 point. (This still seems wrong...)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played rock.

I won. -1 point. (This seems wrong too...)\n\nActually, I think the game description itself might have an error or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me try to infer the rules from the actual game results:\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. +1 point.\nIf I won with paper against scissors, then paper must beat scissors.\n\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I lost. -1 point.\nIf I lost with rock against scissors, then scissors must beat rock.\n\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. +3 points.\nIf I won with rock against paper, then rock must beat paper.\n\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. +1 point.\nIf I won with scissors against rock, then scissors must beat rock.\n\nBut this contradicts what we saw in Round 6. Let me double check all these rounds again...\n\nActually, wait, there might be a simple typo in the feedback. Let me re-check:\n\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors.\nResult: I won. +1 point.\nThis could be a typo, as scissors typically beats paper.\n\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors.\nResult: I lost. -1 point.\nThis could be a typo, as rock typically beats scissors.\n\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper.\nResult: I won. +3 points.\nThis could be a typo, as paper typically beats rock.\n\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock.\nResult: I won. +1 point.\nThis could be a typo, as rock typically beats scissors.\n\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper.\nResult: I lost. -1 point.\nThis could be a typo, as scissors typically beats paper.\n\nIt seems like there might be typos in the opponent's moves or in the results. Given this uncertainty, I'll make a strategic move that doesn't rely too heavily on pattern recognition:\n\nLet me play rock.",

This suggests that the opponent might have adapted their strategy based on my moves.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be using a pattern recognition strategy. Let me look at the recent pattern more closely:\n\nRounds 14-20:\n- Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1) - This doesn't make sense based on the rules\n- Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1) - This doesn't make sense based on the rules\n- Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3) - This doesn't make sense based on the rules\n\nWait, there seems to be a discrepancy between the reported results and the actual game rules. According to the initial rules:\n- Paper beats rock (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats scissors (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\nBut the results I'm seeing don't align with these rules. For example, in Round 14, I played scissors and opponent played paper, but scissors should beat paper and I should have won, not lost.\n\nLet me check if I misunderstood the rules. From the initial description:\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I see the issue. The rules are stated differently from the traditional rock-paper-scissors. In this version:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is a cyclical relationship, but different from the traditional game.\n\nGiven this understanding, let me see if the results make more sense:\n\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so I lost -1 points.\nRound 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost -1 points.\nRound 16: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost -3 points.\n\nNow the results align with the rules as explained. Let me adjust my strategy based on this correct understanding.\n\nGiven the pattern in recent rounds, it seems like my opponent might be responding to my previous move in some way. Let me try to break any pattern they might be recognizing. In rock-paper-scissors style games, randomness is often a good strategy, but let's also consider what would be most beneficial in terms of points.\n\nRock beats paper with the highest reward (+3), so if I expect my opponent to play paper, rock would be the best choice. But given the recent pattern of my losses, it might be that my opponent is adapting to counter my moves.\n\nLet me try scissors this round, as it can beat rock, which has been working against me recently.",

Let me review the game descriptions more carefully. It says:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\nSo paper should beat scissors, rock should beat paper, and scissors should beat rock. But the outcomes I'm getting don't match this description. Let me re-interpret the game results:\n\nRound 1: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nRound 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors - according to rules, scissors should beat paper, but I won?\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n\nI think there might be a mismatch between my understanding and the actual game rules. Let me check the results again:\n\nRound 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I lost, which means scissors beats rock\nRound 9: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won, which means rock beats paper\nRound 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won, which means paper beats scissors\n\nThis is confusing as it contradicts the original rules description. Let me try a different move and see what happens.\n\nLooking at recent rounds:\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3)\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\nRound 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n\nI've been losing consistently in recent rounds.

If I'm playing against a fresh player who has no history, they might:\n   - Play randomly\n   - Play rock as it has the highest potential payoff\n   - Play what they think is a popular first move\n\n5. Since rock has the highest potential reward (+3), it might be tempting for a new player to choose it.\n\n6.

In standard rock-paper-scissors, all strategies are equally effective against a rational opponent in a single game.

Let me think about the strategy:\n\n1. The payoff matrix is asymmetric, which means some moves are riskier but potentially more rewarding than others.\n   - Rock is high-risk, high-reward: If I win, I get 3 points, but if I lose, I lose 3 points.\n   - Paper and Scissors are lower-risk: winning gives 1 point, losing costs 1 point.\n\n2. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors, without the asymmetric payoffs, all strategies would be equally valid in a one-shot game. But with these payoffs, I need to consider the expected value of each move.\n\n4. For my first move, I might want to avoid the highest risk option (rock) since I don't have information about my opponent yet.\n\n5. Between paper and scissors, both have the same risk level (-1 if I lose), but scissors has a higher potential reward if my opponent plays rock (I would get 3 points).\n\nGiven these considerations, I think I'll choose scissors for my first move. It has a balanced risk profile with the potential for the highest reward if my opponent chooses rock.\n\nActually, I should double-check my understanding of the rules. The description says:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis is different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (same as standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nGiven this circular relationship, let me reconsider:\n\nIf I play paper:\n- I win against scissors (+1 point)\n- I lose against rock (-3 points)\n- I tie against paper (0 points)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- I win against paper (+3 points)\n- I lose against scissors (-1 point)\n- I tie against rock (0 points)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- I win against rock (+1 point)\n- I lose against paper (-1 point)\n- I tie against scissors (0 points)\n\nLooking at the expected values (assuming random play from opponent):\nPaper: (1-3+0)/3 = -2/3\nRock: (3-1+0)/3 = 2/3\nScissors: (1-1+0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this calculation, rock seems to have the highest expected value against a random player. I'll choose rock for my first move.\n\nWait, I think I'm still misunderstanding the rules. Let me read again carefully:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: Paper player gets 1 point, scissors player gets -1\n- Rock beats paper: Rock player gets 3 points, paper player gets -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Scissors player gets 1 point, rock player gets -1\n\nThis is very different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the same circular relationship as standard RPS, but with different payoffs.\n\nSo the correct expected values (against random play) would be:\n\nPaper:\n- Win vs scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 = +1/3\n- Lose vs rock: 1/3 chance of -3 = -1\n- Tie vs paper: 1/3 chance of 0 = 0\nTotal EV for paper: -2/3\n\nRock:\n- Win vs paper: 1/3 chance of +3 = +1\n- Lose vs scissors: 1/3 chance of -1 = -1/3\n- Tie vs rock: 1/3 chance of 0 = 0\nTotal EV for rock: +2/3\n\nScissors:\n- Win vs rock: 1/3 chance of +1 = +1/3\n- Lose vs paper: 1/3 chance of -1 = -1/3\n- Tie vs scissors: 1/3 chance of 0 = 0\nTotal EV for scissors: 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value against a random player. I'll choose rock for my first move.\n\nActually, I think I'm still confused about the rules. The traditional RPS rules are:\n- Rock crushes scissors\n- Scissors cuts paper\n- Paper covers rock\n\nBut the description says:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis seems like the rules are inverted from the traditional game. Let me make sure I understand correctly.\n\nWait, I think the description was unclear. Let me re-read it:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means paper wins against scissors (unusual), and paper gets +1, scissors gets -1.\n\n\"- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\nThis means rock wins against paper (traditional), and rock gets +3, paper gets -3.\n\n\"- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means scissors wins against rock (unusual), and scissors gets +1, rock gets -1.\n\nSo the relationship is:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the same cyclic relationship as traditional RPS, but the matchups are flipped.\n\nGiven this understanding, the expected values I calculated earlier should be correct:\n- Rock: EV = +2/3\n- Paper: EV = -2/3\n- Scissors: EV = 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value against a random player, so I'll choose rock for my first move.",

It could be random, or they might be using some other strategy I haven't identified yet.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I need to make a move that balances potential gains and losses.\n\nThe payoff structure is:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n- Same move: 0 (tie)\n\nSince I just won with scissors against rock (which is actually unusual given the rules stated earlier), the opponent might anticipate me playing scissors again. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play paper.\n\nIf I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie (0 points).\nIf I play paper and they play rock, I win (+1 point).\nIf I play paper and they play scissors, I lose (-1 point).\n\nIf I play rock and they play paper, I lose (-3 points).\nIf I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie (0 points).\nIf I play rock and they play scissors, I win (+1 point).\n\nIf I play scissors and they play paper, I win (+1 point).\nIf I play scissors and they play rock, I lose (-1 point).\nIf I play scissors and they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points).\n\nSince there seems to be some inconsistency in what's happening (scissors beating rock), I should probably stick with what has worked. Scissors gave me a win last round, so there's some evidence it might work again.\n\nHowever, I should note that according to the rules provided initially, rock should beat scissors (giving +1 to the rock player and -1 to the scissors player). But in the last round, scissors beat rock, giving me +1 points. This is contradicting the initial rules, unless there was a mistake in reporting the outcome.\n\nLet me go with the move that has the most balanced risk profile given this uncertainty: paper.",

In Round 13, I played scissors and my opponent played paper, but I lost according to the feedback. But scissors should beat paper according to the rules! Let me double check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n\nOh! I misunderstood. In this game:\n- Rock beats scissors (not paper)\n- Paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- Scissors beats paper (not rock)\n\nThis is the opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors! No wonder my predictions have been failing.\n\nGiven the correct rules:\n- Paper beats rock: +1/-1\n- Rock beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Scissors beats paper: +1/-1\n\nThis explains why my strategy hasn't been working. I need to rethink everything based on the correct rules.\n\nLet me re-analyze the entire game with the correct understanding of the rules:\n\nWait, something is still confusing. The hint specified:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nThis is neither standard rock-paper-scissors nor the reverse. It's a unique cycle where:\nPaper > Scissors > Rock > Paper\n\nLet me re-examine the game history carefully to confirm:\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\nThis would be consistent with scissors beating rock.\n\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3)\nThis would be consistent with rock beating paper.\n\nRound 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1)\nThis would be consistent with paper beating scissors.\n\nRound 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\nThis would be consistent with scissors beating rock.\n\nThis confirms the unique cycle: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper\n\nWith this understanding, let me determine my next move. The opponent's pattern is complex, but they just played paper. If they cycle through their moves, they might play scissors next.\n\nAgainst scissors, I should play paper (as paper beats scissors).",

I said rock would win against paper, but according to the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nThis means paper beats rock, not the other way around. Yet I was told I won with rock against paper and scored +3 points. Let me double-check the rules...\n\nActually, I think I've been misunderstanding the rules the whole time. Let me carefully re-read the rules:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I see the issue. I think I've been reading it backward. The format is actually \"[winner] beats [loser]\" not \"[move] beats [what it beats]\".\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\n- Paper loses to scissors (-1)\n- Paper beats rock (+1)\n- Rock loses to scissors (-3)\n- Rock beats paper (+3)\n- Scissors loses to paper (-1)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1)\n\nNo wait, that's still inconsistent.

You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper. You scored 3 points.\"\n\nThis directly contradicts the rule that rock beats paper. Unless the rules were stated incorrectly in the beginning.\n\nLet me try to infer the actual rules from the game history:\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1) \u2192 Scissors beats rock\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3) \u2192 Rock beats paper\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1) \u2192 Paper beats scissors\n\nSo the actual rules appear to be:\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors +1 / rock -1\n- Rock beats paper: rock +3 / paper -3\n- Paper beats scissors: paper +1 / scissors -1\n\nThis is the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle, but with asymmetric payoffs (rock beating paper gives more points).\n\nNow I just got confirmation that:\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3) \u2192 Rock beats paper\n\nWait, but this contradicts what I just figured out! If rock beats paper, I should have won, not lost. Unless the rules were stated incorrectly again, or there's a typo in the feedback.\n\nLet me go with what I believe the rules to be based on the classic game, with the asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper beats rock: paper +1 / rock -1\n- Rock beats scissors: rock +3 / scissors -3\n- Scissors beats paper: scissors +1 / paper -1\n\nLet's stick with this interpretation and see if it makes sense. So if I played rock and my opponent played paper in Round 16, I should have lost (-1) not won (+3).\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try one more approach. Let me review all the past rounds and see if I can figure out the consistent rule:\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3)\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3)\n\nGiven these results, the rules must be:\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors +1 / rock -1 (confirmed by rounds 6 and 15)\n- Paper loses to rock: paper -3 / rock +3 (confirmed by round 9)\n- Paper beats scissors: paper +1 / scissors -1 (confirmed by round 14)\n- Rock beats paper: rock +3 / paper -3 (confirmed by round 16)\n\nBut this creates an inconsistent cycle! In a valid RPS game, if A beats B and B beats C, then C must beat A. But here we have:\n- Scissors beats rock\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n\nThis is correct for a standard RPS game. The payoffs are just different.\n\nLet me re-read the original rules one more time:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nI think I misunderstood the rules initially. The rules actually state:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (not the other way around)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\nBut this doesn't follow the standard RPS cycle! In standard RPS:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nSo the rules of this game are completely different from standard RPS. Let me confirm this by checking the game history again:\n\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1) \u2192 Scissors beats rock (matches the rules)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost, -3) \u2192 Paper loses to rock (matches the rules)\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won, +1) \u2192 Paper beats scissors (matches the rules)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1) \u2192 Scissors beats rock (matches the rules)\nRound 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +3) \u2192 Rock beats paper (matches the rules)\n\nOk, this confirms the rules as stated:\n- Paper beats scissors: paper +1 / scissors -1\n- Rock beats paper: rock +3 / paper -3\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors +1 / rock -1\n\nThis creates a valid cycle, just different from standard RPS. Now I need to plan my next move.\n\nMy opponent has consistently cycled through rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. Their last move was paper, so following the pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\nAgainst scissors:\n- Rock would lose (-1)\n- Paper would win (+1)\n- Scissors would tie (0)\n\nBased on their pattern and the confirmed rules, paper is my optimal choice for the next round.",

Rock doesn't beat paper - paper beats rock. And I just played rock against their paper but the result says I won 3 points?\n\nThis suggests either:\n1. I'm misremembering the rules\n2.

The rules as stated and some of the results don't align.\n\nLet me operate based on what the game results are showing:\n- Rock seems to beat paper (+3/-3)\n- Paper seems to beat scissors (+1/-1)\n- Scissors seems to beat rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo based on these observed results, I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nMy opponent's pattern does seem to be rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors...\nThey just played paper, so their next move should be scissors.\n\nAccording to what I've observed:\n- Against scissors: rock would lose (-1), paper would win (+1), scissors would tie (0)\n\nSo paper seems to be the optimal choice.",

According to these rules, paper should beat rock, so I should have lost and received -3 points. But the result states that I won and scored +3 points.\n\nLet me double-check the rules from the original game description again:\n\n\"Game Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\"\n\nOh wait, I see the issue. I've been interpreting the rules incorrectly.

That would explain why I've been winning when I thought I would lose and vice versa.\n\nLet me re-interpret the rules:\n- Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n- Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n\nGiven this correct interpretation, let me update my strategy:\n\nThe opponent's last move was paper, and they appear to follow a pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. So their next move would likely be scissors.\n\nAccording to the correct rules:\n- If they play scissors and I play rock: I win (+1)\n- If they play scissors and I play paper: I lose (-1)\n- If they play scissors and I play scissors: tie (0)\n\nTherefore, rock would be my optimal move.",
