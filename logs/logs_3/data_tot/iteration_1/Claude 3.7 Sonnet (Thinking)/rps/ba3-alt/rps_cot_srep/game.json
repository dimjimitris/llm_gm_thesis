Analyze the payoff structure for each possible move:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: +3, loser: -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n\n2. Consider the expected value of each move if my opponent plays randomly:\n   - Paper: (0 if tie + (-3) if rock + 1 if scissors)/3 = -2/3\n   - Rock: (3 if paper + 0 if tie + (-1) if scissors)/3 = 2/3\n   - Scissors: (-1 if paper + 1 if rock + 0 if tie)/3 = 0\n\n3. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player.\n   - It offers a high reward (3 points) when it wins\n   - Its loss penalty is relatively small (-1)\n\n4.

Consider what my opponent might do in this second round:\n   - A common strategy after a tie is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous move\n   - In this case, many players would switch from rock to paper (since paper beats rock)\n   - This is especially true since rock has high reward value (+3 points) when it beats paper\n\n3. If my opponent is likely to switch to paper, my best response would be:\n   - Scissors, which beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n   \n4. Evaluate the risk if I'm wrong:\n   - If opponent stays with rock, they would beat my scissors (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - If opponent goes to scissors, we tie again (0 points)\n\n5.

Evaluate my best strategic response:\n   - After they've played scissors and won, they might:\n     a) Stick with scissors again (they've repeated scissors before)\n     b) Switch to rock (they often alternate between these two moves)\n   - Paper would win against both scissors (+1) and rock (+1)\n   - The risk of them playing paper is low (only 2/13 rounds historically)\n\n5.

That doesn't sound right. Typically scissors cuts paper.\n- Rock beats paper? Typically paper covers rock.\n\nLet me reinterpret:\n- If it says \"paper beats scissors\", then when paper faces scissors, paper wins (1 point) and scissors loses (-1 point).\n- If it says \"rock beats paper\", then when rock faces paper, rock wins (3 points) and paper loses (-3 points).\n- If it says \"scissors beats rock\", then when scissors faces rock, scissors wins (1 point) and rock loses (-1 point).\n\nThis seems to be a non-standard RPS game with different winning relationships and asymmetric payoffs.\n\nLet me create the correct payoff matrix:\n\n1.

The message says:\n- paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo in round 15, I played rock and they played scissors. According to these rules, scissors beats rock, so I lost 1 point.

They just won with scissors twice in a row. Players often continue with winning moves.\n2. Their pattern had been alternating between scissors and paper, but they broke that by playing scissors twice.\n3. They might expect me to counter scissors with paper (since paper beats scissors in this game).\n4. If they think I'll play paper, they might play rock (which beats paper).\n\nIn this variant:\n- Against scissors, paper would win (+1 points)\n- Against rock, scissors would win (+1 points)\n- Against paper, rock would win (+3 points)\n\nGiven their tendency to play scissors most frequently, and the fact they just played scissors twice in a row (and won), I think paper is my best move. If they switch to rock expecting my paper, I'll lose 3 points, but that's a risk I have to take based on their demonstrated preference for scissors.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

          "output_text": "I need to think strategically about my first move in this variant of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nSteps:\n1. Analyze the payoff structure for each possible move:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: +3, loser: -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n\n2.

They just lost with rock against my scissors\n2. They seem to be fairly predictable, often returning to rock after losses\n3. They rarely play paper (just once in all rounds)\n\nWhat might they do next?\n- Option 1: They might stick with rock despite losing (they've shown this stubborn tendency before)\n- Option 2: They might switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play\n- Option 3: They might finally try paper again\n\nI've had success with scissors against them multiple times. If they stick with rock, scissors would win again. If they switch to paper, scissors would lose. If they switch to scissors, we would tie.\n\nGiven their strong preference for rock and scissors, and their demonstrated tendency to repeat moves even after losses, scissors still seems to have the best expected value.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful about becoming too predictable myself. I've just played scissors and won, and they might expect me to repeat this move. If they expect scissors, they might play paper to counter it.\n\nStill, their historical reluctance to play paper (only 1/10 rounds) makes this less likely.\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- If I play scissors: +1 (if rock) - 1 (if paper) + 0 (if scissors) = 0 expected points if they play randomly, but weighted toward positive if they favor rock\n- If I play rock: -1 (if scissors) + 3 (if paper) + 0 (if rock) = +2 expected points if they play randomly\n- If I play paper: +1 (if scissors) - 3 (if rock) + 0 (if paper) = -2 expected points if they play randomly\n\nBased on raw game theory, rock would have the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nBut this opponent has shown a strong preference for rock and scissors over paper. If I think they're more likely to play scissors to counter my potential scissors play, then paper would be my best response.\n\nGiven their pattern and psychology after just losing, I think they're most likely to either repeat rock or switch to scissors. Against these two likely options, scissors would either win or tie.\n\nI'll play scissors again to exploit their rock preference and psychological pattern after losses.",

I also correctly switched to scissors.\n\nLet's review the full game history and look for patterns:\n- Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 2: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 7: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n- Round 8: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 9: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n- Round 10: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 11: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n- Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n- Round 13: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 15: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 16: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 17: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 18: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 19: My rock vs their paper (I won, +3)\n- Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n\nCurrent score: 0 points\n\nWhat does my opponent typically do after a tie with scissors?\n- After round 4 (scissors tie), they played rock in round 5\n- After round 6 (scissors tie), they played paper in round 7\n- Now after round 20 (scissors tie), they'll play what?\n\nThere's no consistent pattern after scissors ties. Let me look at their overall behavior after ties:\n- After round 1 (rock tie) \u2192 rock (stayed the same)\n- After round 3 (rock tie) \u2192 scissors (changed)\n- After round 4 (scissors tie) \u2192 rock (changed)\n- After round 6 (scissors tie) \u2192 paper (changed)\n- After round 14 (paper tie) \u2192 scissors (changed)\n- After round 16 (rock tie) \u2192 rock (stayed the same)\n- After round 18 (paper tie) \u2192 paper (stayed the same)\n- After round 20 (scissors tie) \u2192 ?\n\nThey've changed their move 4 times after ties and kept the same move 3 times. So they're slightly more likely to change after a tie.\n\nTheir overall move distribution:\n- Rock: 7/20 rounds\n- Scissors: 8/20 rounds (most common)\n- Paper: 5/20 rounds (least common)\n\nAfter scissors, what do they typically play next?\n- Round 4 (scissors) \u2192 Round 5 (rock)\n- Round 6 (scissors) \u2192 Round 7 (paper)\n- Round 8 (scissors) \u2192 Round 9 (scissors)\n- Round 11 (scissors) \u2192 Round 12 (paper)\n- Round 13 (scissors) \u2192 Round 14 (paper)\n- Round 15 (scissors) \u2192 Round 16 (rock)\n- Round 20 (scissors) \u2192 ?\n\nAfter scissors: rock (2 times), paper (3 times), scissors (1 time)\n\nThey seem to favor paper after scissors, with rock as their second choice.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n1. If they play paper (most likely based on their pattern after scissors) \u2192 rock would win (+3)\n2. If they play rock (second most likely) \u2192 scissors would win (+1)\n3. If they repeat scissors \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n\nSince paper appears to be their most likely move after scissors, and rock has the highest payoff against paper (+3), I'll choose rock for this round.",

Let me carefully analyze the situation after this significant loss.\n\nFull game history so far:\n- Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 2: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 7: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n- Round 8: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 9: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n- Round 10: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 11: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n- Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n- Round 13: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 15: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 16: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 17: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 18: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 19: My rock vs their paper (I won, +3)\n- Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n- Round 22: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n- Round 23: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n\nMy current score: -3 points\n\nTheir move distribution:\n- Rock: 9/23 rounds (39.1%)\n- Scissors: 9/23 rounds (39.1%)\n- Paper: 5/23 rounds (21.7%)\n\nAnalysis of my opponent's behavior:\n1. They just won with rock against my paper (a big win for them, +3)\n2. Players often repeat moves after big wins\n3. They switched from scissors in round 22 to rock in round 23, showing adaptability\n4. Their choice of rock could indicate they predicted I would play paper\n\nMy recent performance:\n1. I just suffered a major loss (-3 points)\n2. I've lost the last two consecutive rounds\n3. My score has dropped from +1 to -3\n\nOpponent's pattern after wins:\n- After winning with scissors in round 8, they played scissors again in round 9\n- After winning with paper in round 12, they played scissors in round 13\n- After winning with scissors in round 22, they played rock in round 23\n\nStrategic considerations:\n1. If they repeat rock after this big win \u2192 scissors would win (+1)\n2. If they switch to paper \u2192 rock would win (+3) \n3. If they switch to scissors \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n\nGiven that they've shown a tendency to switch their moves even after wins, and they've just had a big win with rock, I think they might either:\na) Repeat rock (feeling confident after a big win)\nb) Switch to scissors (anticipating I might play scissors to counter their rock)\n\nPaper seems too risky given their recent win with rock against my paper.\nScissors would work against rock but lose to paper.\nRock would work against paper but lose to scissors.\n\nBased on their historical behavior and psychology of players after big wins, scissors seems like the optimal choice. Even if they switch to scissors, I would only lose 1 point, while if they repeat rock, I would gain 1 point.",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n   - Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 8: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 9: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 10: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 11: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 13: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 15: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 16: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 18: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: My rock vs their paper (I won, +3)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 22: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 23: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n   - My current score: -3 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's surprising behavior:\n   - They switched from scissors to rock after winning\n   - Rock is now tied with scissors as their most frequent play (9/23 each)\n   - Their distribution: Rock (9/23), Scissors (9/23), Paper (5/23)\n\n3. Consider their pattern after consecutive wins:\n   - They just won with rock against my paper\n   - I've lost heavily twice with paper against rock (rounds 5 and 23)\n   - They might expect me to avoid paper after such a heavy loss\n\n4. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat rock (they've shown persistence with moves) \u2192 scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to avoid paper) \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper (least common move) \u2192 rock would win (+3)\n\n5. Given my success with scissors against their rock (rounds 2, 10, 17, 21), and the fact that scissors has the best win record for me, scissors is my optimal choice.\n\n[move] scissors",

My opponent is becoming less predictable, which is challenging.\n\nTheir overall distribution:\n- Rock: 9/23 rounds (now most common)\n- Scissors: 9/23 rounds (tied for most common)\n- Paper: 5/23 rounds (least common)\n\nLet me analyze their transitions after winning:\n- After winning with scissors in round 8, they played scissors in round 9\n- After winning with rock in round 5, they played scissors in round 6\n- After winning with paper in round 12, they played scissors in round 13\n- After winning with scissors in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n- After winning with scissors in round 22, they played rock in round 23\n\nI notice they've now switched to rock after winning with scissors in both rounds 22 and 15. This might be an emerging pattern.\n\nAfter I've lost heavily with paper (-3), I should change my strategy. Since they just played rock, they might:\n1. Repeat rock (they've shown they can be stubborn with moves)\n2. Switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again)\n3. Switch to paper (least likely based on their history)\n\nGiven the high penalty of being wrong with paper again (-3), and the fact that scissors has been successful against their rock multiple times, I'll play scissors.",
