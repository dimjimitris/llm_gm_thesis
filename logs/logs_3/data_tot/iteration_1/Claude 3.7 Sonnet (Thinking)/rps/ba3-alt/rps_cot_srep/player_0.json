    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure for each possible move:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: +3, loser: -3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: +1, loser: -1)\n\n2. Consider the expected value of each move if my opponent plays randomly:\n   - Paper: (0 if tie + (-3) if rock + 1 if scissors)/3 = -2/3\n   - Rock: (3 if paper + 0 if tie + (-1) if scissors)/3 = 2/3\n   - Scissors: (-1 if paper + 1 if rock + 0 if tie)/3 = 0\n\n3. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player.\n   - It offers a high reward (3 points) when it wins\n   - Its loss penalty is relatively small (-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player with no established pattern, maximizing expected value is a reasonable strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider what my opponent might do in this second round:\n   - A common strategy after a tie is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous move\n   - In this case, many players would switch from rock to paper (since paper beats rock)\n   - This is especially true since rock has high reward value (+3 points) when it beats paper\n\n3. If my opponent is likely to switch to paper, my best response would be:\n   - Scissors, which beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n   \n4. Evaluate the risk if I'm wrong:\n   - If opponent stays with rock, they would beat my scissors (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - If opponent goes to scissors, we tie again (0 points)\n\n5.

Consider their likely next move:\n   - After winning, players often repeat their move\n   - However, their historical pattern after playing paper (round 7) was to switch to scissors\n   - They've shown they can adapt and surprise with paper when I least expect it\n\n5.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: My paper vs their rock (I lost, -3)\n   - Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 8: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 9: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 10: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 11: My paper vs their scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 13: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 14: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 15: My rock vs their scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 16: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - Round 18: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: My rock vs their paper (I won, +3)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: My scissors vs their rock (I won, +1)\n   - My current score: +1 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's reactions to losses:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - Players typically change their move after losing\n   - Their distribution: Rock (8/21), Scissors (8/21), Paper (5/21)\n\n3. Consider their pattern after losses:\n   - After losing with rock in round 17, they played paper in round 18\n   - After losing with paper in round 19, they played scissors in round 20\n   - They consistently change moves after losses\n\n4. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - If they switch to paper (following their pattern after rock losses) \u2192 rock would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors (their other common move) \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n   - If they repeat rock (unlikely) \u2192 scissors would win again (+1)\n\n5. Given their tendency to change moves after losing and the high reward for correctly predicting paper, rock offers the best expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze my opponent's behavior after wins:\n   - They just won with scissors against my rock\n   - Players often repeat moves that have just succeeded\n   - Their distribution: Rock (8/22), Scissors (9/22), Paper (5/22)\n\n3. Consider their pattern with scissors:\n   - They've now played scissors in rounds 20 and 22\n   - Scissors is now their most played move (9/22)\n   - They've won with scissors multiple times (rounds 8, 15, 22)\n\n4. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat scissors after winning \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock \u2192 scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper \u2192 rock would win (+3)\n\n5. Given their recent success with scissors and tendency to favor it overall, paper is my best strategic choice.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze my opponent's behavior after big wins:\n   - They just won a significant victory with rock (+3 points)\n   - Players often repeat moves after major wins\n   - Their distribution: Rock (9/23), Scissors (9/23), Paper (5/23)\n\n3. Consider their pattern shifts:\n   - They switched from scissors in round 22 to rock in round 23\n   - After winning with paper in round 12, they switched to scissors\n   - They show adaptability in their strategy\n\n4. Apply strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat rock after this big win \u2192 scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper (less likely) \u2192 rock would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors \u2192 paper would win (+1)\n\n5. Given their history of winning with rock against paper, and the psychology of players after big wins, scissors is my optimal choice.\n\n[move] scissors"
