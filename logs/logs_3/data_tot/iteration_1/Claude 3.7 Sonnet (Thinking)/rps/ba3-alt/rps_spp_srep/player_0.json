    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 point (winner), -1 point (loser)\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 point (winner), -1 point (loser)\n- Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\nThe highest reward comes from playing rock against paper, but also the highest penalty from the opposite. This creates interesting strategic considerations.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no behavioral patterns to analyze. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in traditional rock-paper-scissors games. Given the modified payoff structure, this tendency might be even stronger since rock offers the highest potential reward.\n\nStrategic Planner: If our opponent chooses rock first (a common opening), scissors would be our worst choice (-1 points). Paper would be optimal (+3 points). However, if they anticipate this and choose scissors, we'd lose 1 point. The safest opening might be rock, as the worst case is a tie (0 points) or losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's weigh the expected values. If probability distributions were equal (1/3 each move):\n- Playing rock: (0*1/3) + (-3*1/3) + (1*1/3) = -2/3 points expected\n- Playing paper: (0*1/3) + (1*1/3) + (-3*1/3) = -2/3 points expected\n- Playing scissors: (0*1/3) + (-1*1/3) + (1*1/3) = 0 points expected\n\nScissors has the highest expected value mathematically, but this assumes random play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Since there's no dominant strategy and we need to consider the psychological aspect, I recommend scissors for our first move. It has the best mathematical expected value assuming random play, and protects us from the highest possible loss (-3 from playing paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

This confirms the game rules we were given. Now we need to plan our next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is valuable information. The opponent chose rock in the first round, which is indeed a common opening move as we predicted. Now we need to consider how they might adjust their strategy. There are a few possibilities:\n1. They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. They might switch to paper to counter our expected rock\n3. They might switch to scissors, assuming we'll play paper to counter their rock\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent just lost to scissors, so they might anticipate us playing scissors again and choose paper to counter. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors themselves to avoid losing to scissors again. \n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n- If we play rock: We win 3 points if opponent plays paper, lose 1 point if they play scissors, tie if they play rock.\n- If we play paper: We win 1 point if opponent plays scissors, lose 3 points if they play rock, tie if they play paper.\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 point if opponent plays rock, lose 1 point if they play paper, tie if they play scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that the opponent just lost and is likely to change their strategy, I think they're most likely to play paper this round to counter what they expect will be our rock (as many players would switch to rock after winning with scissors).\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. In terms of the Nash equilibrium for this asymmetric game, the mixed strategy would typically involve playing each move with different probabilities. However, for a one-shot decision with psychological factors at play, we should consider that the opponent is likely adapting to our previous move.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we believe the opponent will play paper, our best move would be rock, which would give us 3 points. The risk is high but so is the reward.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's go with rock. It's a calculated risk based on psychological prediction that the opponent will switch to paper. If they do, we gain 3 points. If they switch to scissors instead, we only lose 1 point, which is manageable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent has now played rock in both rounds, which gives us useful information for planning our next move.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a significant pattern. The opponent has chosen rock twice in a row, suggesting either:\n1. They have a strong preference for rock (possibly due to its higher reward potential)\n2. They're being predictable intentionally to set up a strategy shift\n3. They're not adapting their strategy based on game outcomes\n\nStrategic Planner: The fact that they stuck with rock even after losing to scissors in round 1 suggests they might be focused on the higher potential payoff of rock (3 points if it wins) rather than adapting to avoid losses.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the opponent's consistent choice of rock, paper would be our optimal move as it beats rock and would give us 1 point. The risk is if they finally switch to scissors, we'd lose 3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: People who stick with the same choice twice are more likely to change on the third round, especially after a tie which creates psychological pressure to \"win\" rather than tie again. However, their consistent rock play suggests they value its high reward potential.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In a repeated game with an opponent showing a strong preference for rock, the exploitative strategy would be to play paper. However, we need to consider if they're setting us up for a scissors play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I believe paper is our best move here. If they play rock a third time (continuing their pattern), we win 1 point. If they switch to scissors anticipating our paper, we lose 3 points. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. The expected value favors paper if we assign a higher probability to them playing rock again.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with playing paper. Even though it carries the risk of a higher penalty, the observed behavior pattern strongly suggests the opponent has a preference for rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: That outcome is very important information! The opponent played rock for the third consecutive time, and we lost 3 points with paper. This means I misunderstood the rules. Let me correct the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats paper (not the other way around): +3 points (rock), -3 points (paper)\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 point (paper), -1 point (scissors)\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 point (scissors), -1 point (rock)\n\nPsychology Expert: This completely changes our understanding! The opponent has been consistently playing rock, which in this version is actually a strong move that beats paper with a high payoff. Their strategy makes perfect sense now.\n\nStrategic Planner: With the correct rules, the opponent's consistent rock strategy is rational. Rock only loses to scissors (and only by 1 point), but can win against paper with a high 3-point payoff. The risk-reward ratio favors rock as a strategy.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given that the opponent has played rock three times in a row and has been successful with it, they're likely to continue with this strategy. The clear counter is scissors, which would give us 1 point if they play rock again.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has found success with rock and has no incentive to change their strategy unless we force them to. They've probably observed that we've tried different moves each time.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In the correct game structure, scissors is our best move against an opponent who consistently plays rock. It's a direct counter that gives us a positive payoff.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's play scissors. If they continue their rock strategy, we gain 1 point. If they anticipate this and switch to paper, we lose 1 point. The risk is lower than the potential gain.\n\nDecision Analyst: I concur with scissors. Even if they switch strategies, our maximum potential loss with scissors (-1 point) is less severe than with other moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a fascinating development. The opponent has now played rock in all four rounds, showing an extreme commitment to a single strategy despite experiencing losses. Let's analyze our results so far:\n\nRound 1: We played scissors, opponent played rock, we won 1 point\nRound 2: We played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\nRound 3: We played paper, opponent played rock, we lost 3 points\nRound 4: We played scissors, opponent played rock, we won 1 point\n\nPsychology Expert: This is an extremely unusual pattern. The opponent has played rock every single time regardless of outcomes. This suggests either:\n1. They're using a fixed strategy regardless of results\n2. They're trying to condition us into a predictable counter-pattern\n3. They might not be actively adapting to the game\n\nStrategic Planner: Since they've played rock consistently despite losing to scissors twice now, the most rational move is to continue playing scissors. However, we should consider if this is the round they finally change strategies to catch us off guard.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's quantify this. If we play scissors again and they play rock again, we gain 1 point. If they finally switch to paper, we lose 1 point. The expected value still favors scissors unless we believe the probability of them switching is very high.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four identical moves in a row is extremely persistent behavior. At this point, it seems more likely they're using a fixed strategy rather than setting up a complex trap. Even if they are setting up a trap, the potential loss with scissors (-1) is much less than with other moves against their potential rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In repeated games with highly consistent opponents, the optimal strategy is to exploit their pattern until they change. Scissors remains our best option given their history.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend staying with scissors. It's won us 2 points so far, and the downside risk is limited compared to our other options.\n\nDecision Analyst: Agreed. Scissors is the optimal move based on all available information and risk assessment.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent likely noticed we played scissors twice against their rock and were getting comfortable with that strategy. They've shown they can adapt, but they take time to do so - waiting until we established a pattern they could exploit.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now we need to anticipate their next move. They might:\n1. Continue with paper, thinking we'll stubbornly play scissors again\n2. Switch to rock, anticipating we'll play paper to counter their paper\n3. Switch to scissors, thinking we'll stick with paper\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider the expected outcomes:\n- If we play rock: We win 3 points if they play paper, lose 1 point if they play scissors, tie if they play rock\n- If we play paper: We win 1 point if they play scissors, lose 3 points if they play rock, tie if they play paper\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 point if they play rock, lose 1 point if they play paper, tie if they play scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that they just had success with changing strategies, and that they took so long to adapt, I believe they're more likely to continue with paper for at least one more round. They've seen that we adapt quickly, but they may test if we'll overcorrect or stick with scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. The opponent's behavior suggests they make adjustments slowly and might stick with what worked last time. If they play paper again, rock would be our optimal counter, giving us 3 points. Even if they switch to scissors, our loss would be limited to 1 point.\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock gives us the highest potential gain and limits our potential loss.

They've completely changed their strategy, shifting from extreme consistency to adaptability. This suggests they may be playing a more complex game than we initially thought.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their last three moves form the sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. This could be:\n1. A coincidental sequence as they adapt to our moves\n2. The beginning of a Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle\n3. A deliberate anti-prediction strategy to make their moves hard to anticipate\n\nDecision Analyst: If they're following a simple cycle, they would play rock next. If they're trying to counter our expected move, they'll try to anticipate what we think they'll play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After successfully countering us twice in a row, the opponent might believe we're going to overthink this and try to get ahead of them. A common strategy at this point would be to revert to rock (completing their R-P-S cycle), especially since rock has been their most-played move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this asymmetric game, a player shouldn't be predictable. However, humans often show patterns even when trying not to. If they're completing a cycle, they'll play rock. If they're trying to stay one step ahead, they'll anticipate we expect rock and play paper instead.\n\nStrategic Planner: I believe paper is our safest move here. It beats rock (which has been their dominant strategy) and ties with paper (if they play that). It only loses to scissors, which they just played and might be less likely to repeat immediately.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree.

According to the given rules, paper beats scissors. So if we played paper and the opponent played scissors, we should have won 1 point, which matches our result.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent's sequence is now: Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors. They've repeated scissors twice, after having played rock four times in a row earlier. This suggests they might be developing mini-patterns of repeating moves.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at their recent behavior, they repeated rock multiple times, then switched to paper, then scissors which they've now played twice. If they continue this pattern of repetition, they might stick with scissors again.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play scissors again, our best counter is paper (which beats scissors and gives us 1 point). However, they might be anticipating this and switch to rock, which would cost us 3 points if we play paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that they've lost with scissors twice now, there's a higher probability they'll switch away from it. Their historical preference for rock might make them return to it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In this asymmetric game, rock has the highest reward potential, making it an attractive choice for an opponent looking to maximize points. Their history shows a strong preference for rock overall.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing scissors. If they return to their preferred rock strategy, we win 1 point. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie.

Given the opponent's strong preference for rock, scissors remains a strong strategic choice.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's analyze our performance with each move:\n- Scissors: Played 4 times, won 3 times (+3 points), lost once (-1 point), net +2 points\n- Rock: Played 2 times, tied once (0 points), lost once (-1 point), net -1 point\n- Paper: Played 2 times, won once (+1 point), lost once (-3 points), net -2 points\n\nScissors has clearly been our most successful move.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent returning to rock after experimenting with other moves suggests they may continue with rock for at least another round. They seem to revert to rock when other strategies don't produce sustained success.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the asymmetric payoff structure and the opponent's demonstrated preferences, scissors offers the best expected value against an opponent with a strong tendency to play rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing scissors again. If they continue with rock, we win 1 point. If they anticipate our scissors and play paper, we lose 1 point. The worst-case scenario has a manageable loss, while we maintain the opportunity to capitalize on their established pattern.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. Scissors provides the best risk-adjusted return based on all available information about this opponent's tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

This could indicate they're becoming more adaptive and trying to neutralize our strategy. They seem to be moving away from their initial rock-heavy strategy and becoming less predictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their last five moves show significantly more variety: Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors. They seem to be favoring scissors recently (3 out of the last 5 moves), which might indicate a new pattern forming.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given their recent preference for scissors, paper would counter that effectively, giving us 1 point if they play scissors again. However, we need to consider other possibilities as well.\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, many players tend to switch moves. The opponent might anticipate that we'll switch from scissors to either rock or paper. If they think we'll choose rock (a common choice after scissors), they might play paper. If they think we'll choose paper, they might play rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at the opponent's overall pattern, they seem to be alternating between sticking with a move for multiple rounds and making sudden changes. The recent tie might prompt them to switch again.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given their recent preference for scissors but tendency to switch after staying with a move for a while, rock would be a reasonable choice. If they play scissors again, we win 3 points. If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we lose 1 point. If they switch to rock, it's a tie.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with playing rock. It has the highest potential upside (3 points if they play scissors again) and manageable downside (losing 1 point if they play paper). Given their recent scissors play, rock offers the best risk-adjusted return.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They seem to be cycling through all three moves with increasing frequency, becoming less predictable.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their last few moves show they're adapting more quickly and not staying with any particular strategy. After playing paper and losing significantly (3 points), they might avoid paper in the next round.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the opponent's increasing adaptability, we need a strategy that accounts for their likely next move. If they avoid repeating paper after a big loss, they'll play either rock or scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often avoid immediately repeating a move that resulted in a significant loss. They're more likely to play rock or scissors. Between those two, rock has historically been their preferred move (5 out of 10 rounds).\n\nGame Theory Expert: If we think they're more likely to play rock or scissors, our best move would be scissors. Against rock, scissors would win us 1 point. Against scissors, it would be a tie. The only risk is if they play paper again despite just losing with it.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with scissors as our next move. It's effective against their historically preferred move (rock) and safe against their other likely move (scissors). The risk of them immediately returning to paper after a big loss seems lower.\n\nDecision Analyst: Scissors offers the best risk-adjusted return given the opponent's likely behavior after a significant loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent has played scissors in 5 out of 11 rounds, making it their second most common move after rock. They seem to be developing a preference for scissors in the later rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: After two consecutive ties with scissors, both players often feel pressure to change moves. The opponent is likely to switch away from scissors. Given their history, they might return to rock (their most played move overall) or paper (which they played two rounds ago).\n\nDecision Analyst: If they switch to rock, paper would be our best move (though risky at -3 points if we're wrong). If they switch to paper, rock would be our best move (+3 points). We need to assess which is more likely.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive ties, there's often psychological pressure to \"win\" rather than tie again. Many players will choose what they perceive as their \"strongest\" move, which for this opponent appears to be rock historically.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the asymmetric payoffs, if they're trying to maximize points rather than just wins, they might choose rock which offers the highest potential reward (3 points).\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper. If they return to rock as we suspect, we win 1 point. If they stick with scissors, we lose 1 point.

This is unusual and suggests the opponent might be successfully anticipating our moves or we're falling into a predictable pattern. The opponent has shown increasing adaptability throughout the game.\n\nStrategic Planner: After three consecutive ties, there's often a strong desire to break the pattern. The opponent might be eager to win rather than tie again. Their most recent move was paper, and they've been cycling through all three options fairly regularly in recent rounds.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider what the opponent might be thinking. After using paper and getting a tie, they might:\n1. Switch to rock, hoping to catch us playing scissors\n2. Switch to scissors, anticipating we'll play rock to counter their paper\n3. Stick with paper if they think we'll switch to scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: Three consecutive ties creates psychological pressure to \"win.\" Given the payoff structure, rock offers them the highest potential reward (3 points). Many players would choose rock in this situation, especially since it's been their historically preferred move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent has shown they're becoming more strategic as the game progresses.

This suggests the opponent may have figured out our strategy or is successfully anticipating our moves. Their recent tendency toward scissors (played in 3 of the last 4 rounds) is notable.\n\nStrategic Planner: This pattern of consecutive ties must be broken. The opponent seems to be either very good at predicting our next move or possibly even matching our moves intentionally to force ties.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider a different approach. Instead of trying to predict their next move based on their past behavior, let's consider what would give us the highest potential reward with manageable risk.\n\nPsychology Expert: After such a long streak of ties, both parties will be eager to break the pattern. The opponent might be anticipating another scissors play from us since we've played it frequently. They might choose paper to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In terms of payoff structure, rock has the highest potential reward (3 points against scissors) with a manageable downside (-1 point against paper). Given the unusual situation of multiple consecutive ties, breaking the pattern with a high-reward move is strategically sound.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock. If the opponent continues with scissors (which they've played in 3 of the last 4 rounds), we win 3 points. If they anticipate our rock and play paper, we lose only 1 point. The risk-reward ratio favors rock in this situation.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with rock.

This shows a strong recent preference for scissors, which they've maintained even after the tie streak was broken.\n\nStrategic Planner: The opponent seems to have settled on scissors as their preferred strategy in the later game. They've played scissors in the last two consecutive rounds, suggesting they may continue with this approach.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they continue with scissors, paper would be our optimal counter, giving us 1 point. The risk is if they finally switch away from scissors, potentially to rock which would cost us 3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: After using scissors successfully to break our tie streak, they may stick with it at least one more round.

They seem to have developed a very strong preference for scissors in the later game, even after losing with it in the last round.\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing with scissors against our paper, the opponent might finally switch strategies. However, given their extreme consistency with scissors recently (6 of 7 rounds), they might also stubbornly continue with it.\n\nDecision Analyst: We need to consider both scenarios:\n1. If they continue with scissors, paper would be optimal (+1 point)\n2. If they switch to rock (their second most common move), scissors would be optimal (+1 point)\n3. If they switch to paper, rock would be optimal (+3 points)\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often switch strategies after losing, especially when they've been using the same move repeatedly.

It would win against rock if they switch back to it, and would tie against scissors if they continue their recent pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend scissors.

This is an extremely strong pattern that persists even when it doesn't win. After our paper beat their scissors in round 15, they still played scissors again.\n\nStrategic Planner: This level of commitment to scissors is notable.

If they switch to rock, scissors would be optimal (+1 point).

Even more surprisingly, they've played scissors in the last 5 consecutive rounds, including losing twice to our paper. This level of commitment to a single move despite losses is highly unusual.\n\nStrategic Planner: After losing with scissors against our paper twice now, the opponent is more likely to finally change their strategy. Their persistence with scissors despite negative outcomes suggests they may have been following a predetermined pattern that might now shift.\n\nDecision Analyst: We need to consider the increasing probability that they'll finally adapt:\n1. If they continue with scissors (which they've shown remarkable commitment to), paper remains optimal (+1 point)\n2. If they switch to rock (their second preference), scissors would be optimal (+1 point)\n3. If they switch to paper, rock would be optimal (+3 points)\n\nPsychology Expert: There's a psychological threshold after repeated losses with the same strategy. Two consecutive losses to paper may finally push them to change their approach, especially since we've exploited their scissors pattern successfully.\n\nGame Theory Expert: After being repeatedly exploited with the same counter-strategy, most rational players would adapt. While they've shown unusual commitment to scissors, the probability they finally switch is higher than in previous rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing scissors. After we've successfully used paper against their scissors twice, they're more likely to switch to rock (their early game preference) to counter our expected paper play. Scissors would win against their potential rock play.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with scissors. The risk-reward ratio now favors anticipating their adaptation rather than continuing to exploit a pattern they're likely to finally break.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Most strikingly, they've played scissors in the last 6 consecutive rounds, including losing twice to our paper. This level of commitment to a single move despite losses is extraordinary.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their commitment to scissors is beyond what would be considered rational strategic play. Even after being countered successfully with paper twice, they returned to scissors. This suggests they may be following a predetermined pattern or have some other reason for persistently choosing scissors.\n\nDecision Analyst: Our recent results against this opponent:\n- Paper vs their scissors: Won twice (+1 point each time)\n- Scissors vs their scissors: Tied multiple times (0 points)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests paper is our optimal move against their persistent scissors strategy.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their unusual commitment to scissors even after repeated losses, there's a high probability they'll continue with this pattern. While eventually they must adapt, they've shown no indication of doing so yet despite clear incentives to change.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In a repeated game against an opponent with a highly consistent pattern, the optimal strategy is to exploit that pattern until it changes. Paper directly counters their demonstrated preference for scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper again. The opponent has shown extraordinary commitment to scissors (6 straight rounds), and paper has already proven effective twice against this pattern. While there's always risk they finally switch, their behavior suggests this is unlikely.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with paper.

After 9 consecutive scissors plays, the opponent has finally changed their strategy to paper. This represents their first adaptation after losing five consecutive rounds to our paper play.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their change in strategy is significant. After demonstrating extreme pattern commitment with scissors, they've finally adapted. This suggests they may be responding to our consistent paper counter-strategy.\n\nDecision Analyst: Now that they've shown a willingness to change, we need to reassess:\n- If they continue with paper, rock would be our optimal counter (+3 points)\n- If they switch back to scissors, paper would be optimal (+1 point)\n- If they switch to rock, scissors would be optimal (+1 point)\n\nPsychology Expert: Given their historical pattern of sticking with moves for extended periods (4 rocks early, 9 scissors recently), there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with paper for at least another round to see if we adapt.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their previous behavior suggests they tend to maintain a strategy for multiple rounds before switching. If they follow this pattern, they're likely to play paper again, making rock our optimal counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing rock. It directly counters their most recent move (paper) and offers the highest potential reward (+3 points). Given their demonstrated tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds, this has a good probability of success.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with rock. While it carries some risk if they switch strategies again, their historical behavior patterns suggest they're likely to maintain paper for at least one more round.

After 9 consecutive scissors plays, they've played paper and then rock. This suggests they've completely abandoned their previous pattern and are becoming more adaptive.\n\nStrategic Planner: Their recent moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) could indicate they're now cycling through the three options in sequence, or simply becoming more varied in their approach. Either way, they're clearly no longer committed to a single move as they were with scissors.\n\nDecision Analyst: With their increasing adaptability, we need to consider all possibilities:\n- If they continue with rock (their most recent move), paper would be optimal (+1 point)\n- If they switch to paper, rock would be optimal (+3 points)\n- If they switch to scissors, paper would be optimal (+1 point)\n\nPsychology Expert: After maintaining extremely consistent patterns earlier (4 rocks, then 9 scissors), they're now showing more variability. They might be recognizing our adaptations and becoming more unpredictable themselves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In this situation, paper offers the best overall expected value. It beats rock (their most recent move) and scissors (their most played move overall), only losing to paper which they've played less frequently.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend playing paper. It counters their most recent move (rock), has been historically successful against their most-played move (scissors), and offers a balanced risk-reward profile given the uncertainty about their next move.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree with paper. Based on the opponent's full game history and recent adaptability, paper provides the best chance of a positive outcome across the range of their possible moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"
