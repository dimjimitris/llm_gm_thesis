    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the possible outcomes for each move:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Calculate expected values against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should maximize my expected value.\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent (2/3).\n\n5. While Rock could potentially lose me 3 points, Paper's worst case is only losing 1 point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper"

Consider conditional patterns:\n   - After I played paper, they've historically played rock (except this last round)\n   - After they played paper, they've often alternated to another move\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they follow their pattern after my paper moves, they may play rock\n   - If they play rock, scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they switch back to paper, scissors would lose me 1 point\n   - If they play scissors, rock would lose me 1 point\n\n5.

Analyze previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost 3 points)\n\n2. Count their overall moves:\n   - Paper: 9 times (45% of their moves)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (35% of their moves)\n   - Rock: 4 times (20% of their moves)\n\n3. Analyze recent patterns:\n   - They've started playing more strategically, countering my moves\n   - They just played rock after I played paper (costly -3 points)\n   - In the last 5 rounds, they've played paper twice, scissors twice, and rock once\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play paper (their most common move): rock would win me 3 points\n   - If they play scissors (their recent trend): paper would win me 1 point\n   - If they play rock again: scissors would win me 1 point\n\n5. Given their unpredictability and possible adaptation to my patterns, scissors offers a reasonable chance of winning with minimal loss potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors"
