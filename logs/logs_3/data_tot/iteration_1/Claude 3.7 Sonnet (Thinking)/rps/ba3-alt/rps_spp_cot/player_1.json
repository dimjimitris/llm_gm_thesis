    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff matrix for this variant of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves: tie, no points awarded\n\n2. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I need to consider the expected value of each move.\n\n3. If the opponent plays randomly:\n   - Rock would yield: (0\u00d71/3) + (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) = 2/3 expected points\n   - Paper would yield: (-3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) = -2/3 expected points\n   - Scissors would yield: (1\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0 expected points\n\n4. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player, but a strategic opponent might anticipate this and counter with scissors.\n\n5. Since I want to avoid the large -3 penalty from playing paper against rock, and scissors has a neutral expected value, I'll choose scissors for my first move.\n\n[move] scissors"

In traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology, players often follow scissors with rock. Since we both just played scissors, there's a good chance they'll play rock next.\n\n5. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n6.

According to the game's rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\n5. Since I've won with paper against their scissors twice now, they might anticipate me playing paper again and switch to rock to counter it.\n\n6. However, given their tendency to play scissors frequently (5 of the last 6 moves), they might stick with it due to behavioral inertia.\n\n7. I'll play paper again, which will win against scissors if they continue their pattern.

My opponent's last several moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've played scissors in 11 out of 20 rounds, showing a clear preference.\n\n4. In traditional rock-paper-scissors psychology, players often follow scissors with rock.\n\n5. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n6. Given that they just played scissors and their tendency to switch moves after losses, they might play rock next.\n\n7. I'll play paper this round to counter their potential rock move. This gives me the highest potential gain (3 points) if I'm correct.\n\n[move] paper"

I notice they've played rock in 7 out of 21 rounds, scissors in 11 rounds, and paper in 3 rounds.\n\n4. They've played rock twice in their last three moves, suggesting a possible shift in their strategy.\n\n5. Given their historical preference for scissors and the fact that they just played rock, they might revert to scissors in this round.\n\n6. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n7. I'll play rock this round to counter their potential scissors move, which is their most common move historically.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's last several moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. I notice they've played paper in the last round, and I won with rock.\n\n4. Since I won with rock against their paper, they're likely to switch strategies.\n\n5. Looking at their patterns, they often alternate between moves and may try to anticipate my next move.\n\n6. Given I just won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with scissors.\n\n7. I'll play scissors this round, which would tie with their potential scissors or win against their potential rock play.\n\n[move] scissors"
