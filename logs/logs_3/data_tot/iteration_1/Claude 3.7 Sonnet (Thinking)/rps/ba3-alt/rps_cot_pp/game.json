He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

It says \"paper beats scissors\" but traditionally scissors beats paper.

Let me analyze the optimal strategy:\n\nIf I play:\n- Paper: I win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie with paper (0)\n- Rock: I win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie with rock (0)\n- Scissors: I win against rock (+1), lose against paper (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nGiven these payoffs, if my opponent chooses randomly with equal probability:\n- Expected value of Paper = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n- Expected value of Rock = (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 2/3\n- Expected value of Scissors = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nBased on expected value, Rock seems to be the best choice against a random player. \n\nBut I'm told I'm playing against a fresh player, meaning they likely haven't established a pattern yet.
