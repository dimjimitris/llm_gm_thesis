Let me analyze the game structure:\n\nPayoff structure:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Ties: No points awarded\n\nThis is an interesting variant because the payoffs are asymmetric. Let me think about this strategically.\n\nFirst, let's understand the full payoff matrix from my perspective:\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- Against Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- Against Rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- Against Scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- Against Paper: 3 points (I win)\n- Against Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- Against Scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- Against Paper: -1 point (I lose)\n- Against Rock: 1 point (I win)\n- Against Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nNow, let me think about the expected value of each move assuming my opponent plays randomly (equal probability of each move):\n\nExpected value of Paper = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\nExpected value of Rock = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\nExpected value of Scissors = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on the expected values, Rock seems to be the strongest move in this variant, as it has the highest expected value against a randomly playing opponent.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player and this is the first round, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies. In such a situation, going with the move that has the highest expected value (Rock) makes sense.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is sophisticated, they might also reach the same conclusion and play Paper to counter Rock. But then I should play Scissors to counter their Paper. This is the classic game theory problem - there's no deterministic best move if both players are rational.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player\n3. The loss from playing Rock against Paper (-3) is significant\n\nI think I'll go with Scissors for my first move. This protects me from the severe penalty if my opponent plays Paper to counter the seemingly optimal Rock strategy, and still gives me a chance to win if they play Rock.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what happened in the first round and use that information to make a better choice for the second round:\n\n1. I played Rock, and my opponent played Scissors.\n2. According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock, giving me -1 points.\n\nThis is interesting because the rules state:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nBased on these rules, Rock should actually beat Scissors. But the hint message says I lost when I played Rock against Scissors. This means I must have misunderstood the rules.\n\nLet me re-interpret the rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nThat explains the outcome! I had the matchups reversed in my initial analysis. Let me recalculate the expected values:\n\n- Paper: Win against Rock (+1), Lose against Scissors (-1), Tie against Paper (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n  \n- Rock: Win against Scissors (+1), Lose against Paper (-3), Tie against Rock (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n  \n- Scissors: Win against Paper (+1), Lose against Rock (-1), Tie against Scissors (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected values, Paper and Scissors have equal expected values of 0, while Rock has a negative expected value. \n\nNow, let's think about what my opponent might do next. Since they played Scissors in the first round and won, they might stick with Scissors again, or they might anticipate that I'll switch to Paper and thus switch to Rock themselves.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Paper.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors.\n\nSince Paper has a better expected value than Rock and performs well against a potential Rock move from my opponent, I'll choose Paper for this round.\n\nActually, I need to read the rules again to make sure I understood correctly:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nHmm, I think I misunderstood the rules again. Let me re-interpret:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nWait, this can't be right because the hint said I lost with Rock against Scissors, which suggests Scissors beats Rock.\n\nLet me try again. The rules as stated are:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis means:\n- If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors, I win +1, they lose -1\n- If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper, I win +3, they lose -3\n- If I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock, I win +1, they lose -1\n\nBut this doesn't match what happened in the game, where I lost with Rock against Scissors. \n\nLet me reread the rules carefully...\n\nOh, I see my mistake now. When it says \"paper beats scissors\", it means the person who plays paper beats the person who plays scissors. And similarly for the other rules.\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nThat explains why I lost when playing Rock against Scissors - Scissors beats Rock!\n\nLet me recalculate expected values:\n- Paper beats Scissors, loses to Rock: (+1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n- Rock beats Paper, loses to Scissors: (+3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +2/3\n- Scissors beats Rock, loses to Paper: (+1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this, Rock has the highest expected value.\n\nHowever, my opponent just played Scissors and won. They might stick with the winning move, or they might anticipate me switching to Paper and thus play Rock.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Paper.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Scissors.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Rock.\n\nI think it's most likely they'll stick with Scissors since it worked, so I'll play Paper.\n\nActually, I think I've been getting confused about the rules. Let me double-check again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I play Paper and my opponent plays Scissors, then Scissors beats Paper (not the other way around). The opponent gets +1 and I get -1.\n\nThis matches with my first round experience. I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so opponent got +1 and I got -1.\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\n- Scissors beats Paper: Scissors winner +1, Paper loser -1\n- Rock beats Scissors: Rock winner +3, Scissors loser -3\n- Paper beats Rock: Paper winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nLet me recalculate expected values:\n- Paper beats Rock (+1), loses to Scissors (-1), ties with Paper (0): (+1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n- Rock beats Scissors (+3), loses to Paper (-1), ties with Rock (0): (+3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +2/3\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1), loses to Rock (-3), ties with Scissors (0): (+1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n\nBased on expected values, Rock appears to be the best choice.\n\nHowever, my opponent just won with Scissors. They might stick with Scissors, or they might anticipate me switching and play something else.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Paper.\n\nHmm, actually, I think I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me just read the exact rules again:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo:\n- If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: Paper beats Scissors, I win +1, they lose -1\n- If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper: Rock beats Paper, I win +3, they lose -3\n- If I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock: Scissors beats Rock, I win +1, they lose -1\n\nBut this still doesn't match my experience in the first round! I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, and I lost. \n\nAh, I see. I misread the rules. It's not \"paper beats scissors\", it's actually \"scissors beats paper\". Let me read the rules once more very carefully:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nNow I interpret:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nAnd this matches my experience: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so I lost -1 points.\n\nGiven this, let me reevaluate my strategy.\n\nI believe my opponent might stick with Scissors since it worked. If they do, I should play Paper to beat them.\n\nBut they might anticipate this and switch to Rock. In that case, I should play Scissors.\n\nI think I'll go with Paper for this round. Even though it has a lower expected value against a random opponent, it's a good counter to Scissors which is what my opponent played last time.",

I lost 3 points.\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I lost 1 point.\n\nThis is interesting. The outcome seems counterintuitive because I've lost every round, despite making what seemed like reasonable choices.

Scissors beats Rock, I lost 1 point. \u2713\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rock beats Paper, I lost 3 points. \u2713\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. Paper beats Scissors, I lost 1 point. \u2717\n\nWait, there seems to be a contradiction in the results of Round 3. According to the rules as stated:\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nBut if I played Scissors and opponent played Paper, and Paper beats Scissors, then I should have lost 1 point (which matches the result). So there's no contradiction after all.\n\nMy confusion came from the non-standard wording of the rules. The normal way to state Rock-Paper-Scissors relationships is:\n- Paper covers Rock\n- Rock crushes Scissors\n- Scissors cuts Paper\n\nBut in this game, the relationships are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis is an unusual variant of RPS where the cycle is reversed.\n\nNow that I understand the actual game, let me think about my strategy for the next round.\n\nIt seems my opponent is consistently making moves that beat mine. This suggests they might have some way of predicting my moves or are just getting lucky.\n\nLet me consider a different approach. Since I've played Rock, Paper, and Scissors in that order, and lost each time, my opponent might be anticipating a pattern. Perhaps I should break any expected pattern.\n\nGiven that I just played Scissors, my opponent might expect me to return to Rock. If so, they would play Paper to beat my Rock. To counter this, I should play Scissors.\n\nAlternatively, if my opponent is simply cycling through moves (their pattern has been Scissors, Rock, Paper), they might play Rock next. To beat Rock, I should play Paper.\n\nBut there's another possibility: my opponent is simply playing the move that would have beaten what I played in the previous round. If that's the case, then:\n- I played Rock, they might expect me to play Scissors next, so they'd play Rock\n- I played Paper, they might expect me to play Rock next, so they'd play Paper\n- I played Scissors, they might expect me to play Paper next, so they'd play Scissors\n\nIn this case, I should play Rock to beat their expected Scissors.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think I'll play Rock for this round. If my opponent is following any of these patterns, Rock gives me a good chance of winning.",

Let me re-analyze them based on the outcomes:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats Paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats Rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, if Paper beats Scissors, why did I lose in Round 3 when I played Scissors and they played Paper? That would suggest Scissors loses to Paper.\n\nLet me try again with the rules as stated:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n- According to the rules, Rock beats Paper: I lost 3 points \u2713\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\n- According to the rules, Paper beats Scissors: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock: I won 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n- According to the rules, Rock beats Paper: I won 3 points \u2713\n\nOK, I see the issue now. I misinterpreted the rules. Let me clarify the correct rules:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper +1, Scissors -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock +3, Paper -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors +1, Rock -1\n\nNo, that doesn't work either. Let me try another interpretation:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors means Scissors +1, Paper -1\n- Rock beats Paper means Rock +3, Paper -3\n- Scissors beats Rock means Scissors +1, Rock -1\n\nThat doesn't make sense either. Let's try again, focusing on who gets beaten:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: Paper wins (+1), Scissors loses (-1)\n- Rock beats paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper loses (-3)\n- Scissors beats rock: Scissors wins (+1), Rock loses (-1)\n\nThis makes sense with the history:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n- Rock beats Paper: I lost 3 points \u2713\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock: I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- Scissors beats Rock: I won 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n- Rock beats Paper: I won 3 points \u2713\n\nOK, I understand the rules correctly now. The opponent has been following a predictable pattern of Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper.\n\nIf they continue this pattern, they will play Scissors next. According to the rules:\n- If I play Rock against their Scissors: I would lose 1 point (Scissors beats Rock)\n- If I play Paper against their Scissors: I would win 1 point (Paper beats Scissors)\n- If I play Scissors against their Scissors: It would be a tie (0 points)\n\nGiven this, my optimal move is Paper.",

According to the rules, Scissors should beat Paper, but the result shows I won 1 point. This is inconsistent with the rules.\n\nLet me verify each round:\n- Round 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. Rules state Scissors beats Rock, so I should lose 1 point. This matches.\n- Round 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rules state Rock beats Paper, so I should lose 3 points. This matches.\n- Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. Rules state Paper beats Scissors, so I should lose 1 point. This matches.\n- Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. Rules state Scissors beats Rock, so I should lose 1 point. This matches.\n- Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. Rules state Scissors beats Rock, so I should win 1 point. This matches.\n- Round 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. Rules state Rock beats Paper, so I should win 3 points. This matches.\n- Round 7: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. Rules state Paper beats Scissors, so I should win 1 point. This matches.\n\nHmm, upon closer re-inspection of the rules, I see that \"Paper beats Scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\". So Paper actually beats Scissors according to the rules, not the other way around as in traditional rock-paper-scissors. This aligns with the Round 7 result where I won with Paper against Scissors.\n\nSo the actual rule structure is:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nThis is a non-standard RPS variant where each move beats a different move than in the traditional game.\n\nNow, let's analyze the opponent's pattern:\n- Their moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n- This is a perfectly consistent cycle regardless of my moves\n- Based on this pattern, they will play Rock next\n\nIf they play Rock next, my best response would be:\n- If I play Paper: Rock beats Paper, so I would lose 3 points\n- If I play Rock: It would be a tie, 0 points\n- If I play Scissors: Scissors beats Rock, so I would win 1 point\n\nGiven their consistent pattern and the rule structure, playing Scissors would be my best move to counter their expected Rock move.",

MATCH.\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\nAccording to the rules, Rock beats Paper: I should win 3 points. MATCH.\n\nWait, I think I was confused. Let me reread the rules carefully:\n- Paper beats Scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats Paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats Rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThe rules were written in an unconventional way.

Rock is a common opening move, and if my opponent plays scissors, I'll gain a point. If they play rock, it's a tie, and if they play paper, I'll lose 3 points. But without any prior information, this seems like a reasonable starting point.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since many players start with rock, perhaps paper would be a better strategic choice. If my opponent plays rock (which is common), I win 3 points. If they play paper, we tie. If they play scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\nHmm, let me reason through this more carefully. The expected value of each choice depends on the probabilities of my opponent's moves:\n\nFor rock:\n- If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays paper: -3 points (lose)\n- If opponent plays scissors: +1 point (win)\n\nFor paper:\n- If opponent plays rock: +3 points (win)\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (lose)\n\nFor scissors:\n- If opponent plays rock: -1 point (lose)\n- If opponent plays paper: +1 point (win)\n- If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf I assume the opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3), then the expected value for each of my choices is:\n- Rock: (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (-3 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67 points\n- Paper: (3 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) + (-1 \u00d7 1/3) = 2/3 \u2248 0.67 points\n- Scissors: (-1 \u00d7 1/3) + (1 \u00d7 1/3) + (0 \u00d7 1/3) = 0 points\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value if my opponent plays each move with equal probability.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that many players tend to start with rock, which would make paper an even more favorable choice.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll choose paper as my first move.",

Let me think about this strategically.\n\nFirst, let's understand the full payoff matrix from my perspective:\n\nIf I play Paper:\n- Against Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- Against Rock: -3 points (I lose)\n- Against Scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\nIf I play Rock:\n- Against Paper: 3 points (I win)\n- Against Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- Against Scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I play Scissors:\n- Against Paper: -1 point (I lose)\n- Against Rock: 1 point (I win)\n- Against Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nNow, let me think about the expected value of each move assuming my opponent plays randomly (equal probability of each move):\n\nExpected value of Paper = (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\nExpected value of Rock = (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\nExpected value of Scissors = ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on the expected values, Rock seems to be the strongest move in this variant, as it has the highest expected value against a randomly playing opponent.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player and this is the first round, I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategies. In such a situation, going with the move that has the highest expected value (Rock) makes sense.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is sophisticated, they might also reach the same conclusion and play Paper to counter Rock. But then I should play Scissors to counter their Paper. This is the classic game theory problem - there's no deterministic best move if both players are rational.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Rock has the highest expected value against a random player\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player\n3. The loss from playing Rock against Paper (-3) is significant\n\nI think I'll go with Scissors for my first move. This protects me from the severe penalty if my opponent plays Paper to counter the seemingly optimal Rock strategy, and still gives me a chance to win if they play Rock.",

          "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze what happened in the first round and use that information to make a better choice for the second round:\n\n1. I played Rock, and my opponent played Scissors.\n2. According to the rules, Scissors beats Rock, giving me -1 points.\n\nThis is interesting because the rules state:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nBased on these rules, Rock should actually beat Scissors. But the hint message says I lost when I played Rock against Scissors. This means I must have misunderstood the rules.\n\nLet me re-interpret the rules:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nThat explains the outcome! I had the matchups reversed in my initial analysis. Let me recalculate the expected values:\n\n- Paper: Win against Rock (+1), Lose against Scissors (-1), Tie against Paper (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n  \n- Rock: Win against Scissors (+1), Lose against Paper (-3), Tie against Rock (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n  \n- Scissors: Win against Paper (+1), Lose against Rock (-1), Tie against Scissors (0)\n  Expected value = (1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected values, Paper and Scissors have equal expected values of 0, while Rock has a negative expected value. \n\nNow, let's think about what my opponent might do next. Since they played Scissors in the first round and won, they might stick with Scissors again, or they might anticipate that I'll switch to Paper and thus switch to Rock themselves.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Paper.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors.\n\nSince Paper has a better expected value than Rock and performs well against a potential Rock move from my opponent, I'll choose Paper for this round.\n\nActually, I need to read the rules again to make sure I understood correctly:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nHmm, I think I misunderstood the rules again. Let me re-interpret:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nWait, this can't be right because the hint said I lost with Rock against Scissors, which suggests Scissors beats Rock.\n\nLet me try again. The rules as stated are:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThis means:\n- If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors, I win +1, they lose -1\n- If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper, I win +3, they lose -3\n- If I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock, I win +1, they lose -1\n\nBut this doesn't match what happened in the game, where I lost with Rock against Scissors. \n\nLet me reread the rules carefully...\n\nOh, I see my mistake now. When it says \"paper beats scissors\", it means the person who plays paper beats the person who plays scissors. And similarly for the other rules.\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nThat explains why I lost when playing Rock against Scissors - Scissors beats Rock!\n\nLet me recalculate expected values:\n- Paper beats Scissors, loses to Rock: (+1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n- Rock beats Paper, loses to Scissors: (+3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +2/3\n- Scissors beats Rock, loses to Paper: (+1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this, Rock has the highest expected value.\n\nHowever, my opponent just played Scissors and won. They might stick with the winning move, or they might anticipate me switching to Paper and thus play Rock.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Paper.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Scissors.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Rock.\n\nI think it's most likely they'll stick with Scissors since it worked, so I'll play Paper.\n\nActually, I think I've been getting confused about the rules. Let me double-check again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo if I play Paper and my opponent plays Scissors, then Scissors beats Paper (not the other way around). The opponent gets +1 and I get -1.\n\nThis matches with my first round experience. I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so opponent got +1 and I got -1.\n\nSo the correct interpretation is:\n- Scissors beats Paper: Scissors winner +1, Paper loser -1\n- Rock beats Scissors: Rock winner +3, Scissors loser -3\n- Paper beats Rock: Paper winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nLet me recalculate expected values:\n- Paper beats Rock (+1), loses to Scissors (-1), ties with Paper (0): (+1 - 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n- Rock beats Scissors (+3), loses to Paper (-1), ties with Rock (0): (+3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +2/3\n- Scissors beats Paper (+1), loses to Rock (-3), ties with Scissors (0): (+1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3\n\nBased on expected values, Rock appears to be the best choice.\n\nHowever, my opponent just won with Scissors. They might stick with Scissors, or they might anticipate me switching and play something else.\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, my best move would be Rock.\nIf they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors.\nIf they switch to Rock, my best move would be Paper.\n\nHmm, actually, I think I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me just read the exact rules again:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo:\n- If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: Paper beats Scissors, I win +1, they lose -1\n- If I play Rock and opponent plays Paper: Rock beats Paper, I win +3, they lose -3\n- If I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock: Scissors beats Rock, I win +1, they lose -1\n\nBut this still doesn't match my experience in the first round! I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, and I lost. \n\nAh, I see. I misread the rules. It's not \"paper beats scissors\", it's actually \"scissors beats paper\". Let me read the rules once more very carefully:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nNow I interpret:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Paper winner +1, Scissors loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Rock winner +3, Paper loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Scissors winner +1, Rock loser -1\n\nAnd this matches my experience: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so I lost -1 points.\n\nGiven this, let me reevaluate my strategy.\n\nI believe my opponent might stick with Scissors since it worked. If they do, I should play Paper to beat them.\n\nBut they might anticipate this and switch to Rock. In that case, I should play Scissors.\n\nI think I'll go with Paper for this round. Even though it has a lower expected value against a random opponent, it's a good counter to Scissors which is what my opponent played last time.",

Let's consider potential patterns:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper to counter their scissors, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors to counter what I think will be their paper, they might play rock\n\nThis is getting complex with the second-guessing, but based on the limited information and the fact that rock has the best expected value against random play, I should choose:\n\nActually, let me think one more time about the expected values:\n- Rock: Win vs Scissors (+1), Lose vs Paper (-3), Tie vs Rock (0)\n- Paper: Win vs Rock (+3), Lose vs Scissors (-1), Tie vs Paper (0)\n- Scissors: Win vs Paper (+1), Lose vs Rock (-1), Tie vs Scissors (0)\n\nGiven that my opponent played scissors in the first round, if they continue with scissors, my best response is rock. If they switch to rock (expecting me to play paper), my best response is paper. If they switch to paper (expecting me to play scissors), my best response is scissors.\n\nThere's no clear pattern yet, so I'll make the move that counters their last move, which is rock.",

Scissors beats Rock, I lost 1 point. \u2713\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rock beats Paper, I lost 3 points. \u2713\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper.

So there's no contradiction after all.\n\nMy confusion came from the non-standard wording of the rules. The normal way to state Rock-Paper-Scissors relationships is:\n- Paper covers Rock\n- Rock crushes Scissors\n- Scissors cuts Paper\n\nBut in this game, the relationships are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis is an unusual variant of RPS where the cycle is reversed.\n\nNow that I understand the actual game, let me think about my strategy for the next round.\n\nIt seems my opponent is consistently making moves that beat mine. This suggests they might have some way of predicting my moves or are just getting lucky.\n\nLet me consider a different approach. Since I've played Rock, Paper, and Scissors in that order, and lost each time, my opponent might be anticipating a pattern. Perhaps I should break any expected pattern.\n\nGiven that I just played Scissors, my opponent might expect me to return to Rock. If so, they would play Paper to beat my Rock. To counter this, I should play Scissors.\n\nAlternatively, if my opponent is simply cycling through moves (their pattern has been Scissors, Rock, Paper), they might play Rock next. To beat Rock, I should play Paper.\n\nBut there's another possibility: my opponent is simply playing the move that would have beaten what I played in the previous round. If that's the case, then:\n- I played Rock, they might expect me to play Scissors next, so they'd play Rock\n- I played Paper, they might expect me to play Rock next, so they'd play Paper\n- I played Scissors, they might expect me to play Paper next, so they'd play Scissors\n\nIn this case, I should play Rock to beat their expected Scissors.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think I'll play Rock for this round.

I've lost all three rounds, and my opponent seems to be consistently playing the move that beats what I play.

Looking at it again:\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper wins, not Scissors)\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock wins, not Paper)\n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors wins, not Rock)\n\nSo correcting my understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so I lost 1 point \u2713\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock, Rock beats Paper, so I lost 3 points \u2713\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper, Paper beats Scissors, so I lost 1 point \u2713\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors, Scissors beats Rock, so I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nI've been misinterpreting the rules completely! Let me revise my understanding:\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper wins)\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock wins)\n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors wins)\n\nThis can't be right either because of the circular nature of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nLet me re-check the exact wording from the game description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOh! There's another misunderstanding. Looking at these statements again:\n- \"paper beats scissors\" means Paper is better than Scissors (Paper wins)\n- \"rock beats paper\" means Rock is better than Paper (Rock wins)\n- \"scissors beats rock\" means Scissors is better than Rock (Scissors wins)\n\nThis is a completely different RPS variant than the standard one! In this variant:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nNow let's re-analyze what happened:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. In this variant, Scissors beats Rock, so I lost 1 point \u2713\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. Rock beats Paper, so I lost 3 points \u2713\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. Paper beats Scissors, so I lost 1 point \u2713\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. Scissors beats Rock, so I lost 1 point \u2713\n\nSo far, my opponent has been perfectly countering every move I make. Let me think about their pattern:\n- When I played Rock, they played Scissors (which beats Rock)\n- When I played Paper, they played Rock (which beats Paper)\n- When I played Scissors, they played Paper (which beats Scissors)\n- When I played Rock again, they played Scissors again (which beats Rock)\n\nIt seems like they're either extremely lucky or they can somehow predict my moves. Let me try a different approach for this round. Since I've tried all three moves and lost each time, I'll try to analyze what my opponent might expect me to do next.\n\nIf they're following a pattern themselves, it would be:\nScissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nIf they're just countering me, they might expect me to play Paper next (since I've cycled through Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock), so they'd play Rock.\n\nI'll try to break this pattern by playing Scissors. If they're following their own pattern, they'll play Scissors and we'll tie. If they're countering me, they might expect Paper and play Rock, in which case my Scissors will lose.\n\nBut if they're truly predicting my moves, they'll expect Scissors and play Paper. Since I can't know for sure, I'll go with Scissors as it has the potential for a tie if they're following their own pattern.",

The conventional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nLet me analyze the previous rounds with these conventional rules:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Conventionally, Rock beats Scissors, I should win \u2717 (I actually lost)\n\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n- Conventionally, Paper beats Rock, I should win \u2717 (I actually lost)\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\n- Conventionally, Scissors beats Paper, I should win \u2717 (I actually lost)\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Conventionally, Rock beats Scissors, I should win \u2717 (I actually lost)\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- Conventionally, Scissors loses to Rock, I should lose \u2717 (I actually won)\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n- Conventionally, Rock loses to Paper, I should lose \u2717 (I actually won)\n\nSo the conventional rules don't match either.\n\nLet me try one more interpretation. What if the rules are exactly backward from what's written? If:\n- \"Paper beats Scissors\" actually means \"Scissors beats Paper\"\n- \"Rock beats Paper\" actually means \"Paper beats Rock\"\n- \"Scissors beats Rock\" actually means \"Rock beats Scissors\"\n\nLet's check this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- In this reverse interpretation, Rock loses to Scissors \u2713 (I lost)\n\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n- In this reverse interpretation, Paper loses to Rock \u2713 (I lost)\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\n- In this reverse interpretation, Scissors loses to Paper \u2713 (I lost)\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- In this reverse interpretation, Rock loses to Scissors \u2713 (I lost)\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- In this reverse interpretation, Scissors beats Rock \u2713 (I won)\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n- In this reverse interpretation, Rock beats Paper \u2713 (I won)\n\nThis interpretation seems to match all the results perfectly! So it seems the rules are stated backward. In reality:\n\n- Scissors beats Paper (giving Scissors +1, Paper -1)\n- Paper beats Rock (giving Paper +3, Rock -3)\n- Rock beats Scissors (giving Rock +1, Scissors -1)\n\nThis is actually the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rule set, just with different point values.\n\nWith this understanding, I should continue playing with the opponent's observed pattern:\n- Their moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n- Next expected move: Scissors\n\nMy best counter would be Rock, which beats Scissors according to the actual game mechanics.",

The correct interpretation is:\n- Paper beats Rock (not Scissors): Paper +1, Rock -1\n- Rock beats Scissors (not Paper): Rock +3, Scissors -3\n- Scissors beats Paper (not Rock): Scissors +1, Paper -1\n\nThat would explain the previous results. Let me double check each round:\n\nRound 1: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock: I should have lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n- Rock beats Paper: I should have lost 3 points \u2713\n\nRound 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors: I should have lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock: I should have lost 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors: Opponent should have won 3 points and I should have lost 3 points\n- But the result said I won 1 point... This doesn't match.\n\nSomething still seems off. Let me look at the rules one more time:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\"\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOk, reading very carefully:\n1. Paper beats Scissors: Paper +1, Scissors -1\n2. Rock beats Paper: Rock +3, Paper -3\n3. Scissors beats Rock: Scissors +1, Rock -1\n\nSo for Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock\n- According to rule #3, Scissors beats Rock\n- I should have won 1 point \u2713\n\nRound 6: I played Rock, opponent played Paper\n- According to rule #2, Rock beats Paper\n- I should have won 3 points \u2713\n\nThis matches the results I was given. So I think the rules as stated in the game description are actually incorrect or inverted. The actual game being played follows these rules:\n1. Scissors beats Paper: Scissors +1, Paper -1\n2. Paper beats Rock: Paper +3, Rock -3\n3. Rock beats Scissors: Rock +1, Scissors -1\n\nGiven this understanding, let me analyze the opponent's pattern again and make my next move:\n\nTheir moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\nMy moves: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nIf they maintain their cycle, they'll play Scissors next.\nAccording to the actual game rules being played, Rock beats Scissors.\nSo playing Rock would be my best move.",

This aligns with the Round 7 result where I won with Paper against Scissors.\n\nSo the actual rule structure is:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3 points)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nThis is a non-standard RPS variant where each move beats a different move than in the traditional game.\n\nNow, let's analyze the opponent's pattern:\n- Their moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n- This is a perfectly consistent cycle regardless of my moves\n- Based on this pattern, they will play Rock next\n\nIf they play Rock next, my best response would be:\n- If I play Paper: Rock beats Paper, so I would lose 3 points\n- If I play Rock: It would be a tie, 0 points\n- If I play Scissors: Scissors beats Rock, so I would win 1 point\n\nGiven their consistent pattern and the rule structure, playing Scissors would be my best move to counter their expected Rock move.",
