    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Unlike standard rock-paper-scissors, the rewards and penalties are uneven. Rock beating paper gives 3 points, while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This suggests rock might be a stronger play in terms of potential gain.\n\nProbability Expert: Indeed, if we look at expected values, playing rock has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). The other moves have more moderate outcomes (\u00b11 point). For a first move against an unknown opponent, we need to consider what a rational opponent might choose.\n\nPsychology Analyst: Since this is a fresh player, they have no prior information about our strategy. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games due to psychological reasons. If we anticipate this, paper would be the optimal counter. However, if the opponent is strategic, they might anticipate us choosing paper and go with scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the higher stakes with rock/paper, I recommend choosing scissors for the first move. If the opponent chooses rock (common first choice), we lose only 1 point. If they choose paper (strategic first choice), we gain 1 point. If they choose scissors, it's a tie.\n\nProbability Expert: I agree. Scissors minimizes our potential loss while maintaining a possible gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

According to the results, I played scissors, but my opponent played paper and I lost. This indicates that the rules are actually:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (as stated)\n- Scissors beats rock (as stated)\n\nThis is actually a reversed rock-paper-scissors cycle compared to the standard game.\n\nProbability Expert: You're right. Our strategy needs to adjust to this reversed cycle. Since the opponent played paper last round, they might stick with a winning move or switch anticipating that we'll change tactics.\n\nPsychology Analyst: In these games, players often stick with winning moves. There's a good chance our opponent will play paper again. Given the reversed cycle, we should play rock, which beats paper and gives us 3 points.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock is our optimal move here. It counters paper with a high payoff (3 points). Even if they anticipate this and switch to scissors, we would only lose 1 point, which is an acceptable risk given the potential reward.\n\nProbability Expert: The expected value is favorable for rock right now.

In round 2, we played rock and the opponent played scissors, so we lost another point. The opponent seems to be anticipating our moves successfully.\n\nPsychology Analyst: Looking at the pattern, the opponent has played paper, then scissors. They might be cycling through the moves in order (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), which would mean they'll play rock next. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict our strategy and counter it.\n\nProbability Expert: If we think they're cycling predictably, we should play paper to counter their expected rock move. However, they might be using a more sophisticated strategy based on game theory or pattern recognition.\n\nGame Strategist: There's another possibility - they might be using the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy. Since they won with scissors, they might stick with scissors. If that's the case, we should play paper.\n\nPsychology Analyst: Given the higher reward for rock beating paper (3 points vs 1 point for other combinations), the opponent might be incentivized to play paper hoping we'll play rock again. If so, scissors would be our best move.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider the risk-reward. If we play paper: we win 3 points against rock, lose 3 points against scissors. If we play scissors: we win 1 point against paper, lose 1 point against rock. If we play rock: we win 1 point against scissors, lose 3 points against paper.\n\nProbability Expert: Given the pattern so far and the payoff structure, I recommend paper.

We just had a tie with rock, which suggests they may continue following their original pattern.\n\nProbability Expert: If they're returning to their original pattern, their next move should be paper. This would be consistent with their initial paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle.\n\nPsychology Analyst: After two consecutive ties, both players typically seek to break the pattern. The opponent might anticipate us playing paper (to beat their rock) and play scissors to counter.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff structure:\n- If we play paper against their expected paper, we tie (0 points)\n- If we play scissors against their expected paper, we lose 1 point\n- If we play rock against their expected paper, we win 3 points\n\nHowever, if they anticipate our strategy and play scissors instead:\n- If we play paper against scissors, we lose 1 point\n- If we play scissors against scissors, we tie (0 points)\n- If we play rock against scissors, we lose 1 point\n\nProbability Expert: Given that their last four moves have reverted to their original pattern, I think paper is likely their next move.

We just won with rock against paper, which supports this theory.\n\nProbability Expert: If they maintain their pattern, their next move would be scissors. Let's analyze our options against scissors:\n- If we play paper against scissors, we lose 1 point\n- If we play scissors against scissors, we tie (0 points)\n- If we play rock against scissors, we lose 1 point\n\nThe best outcome against scissors would be a tie by playing scissors ourselves.\n\nPsychology Analyst: We need to consider that after just losing 3 points, they might deviate from their pattern again. However, given that they've been mostly consistent with their pattern recently (7 out of their last 8 moves followed the pattern), the scissors prediction is quite strong.\n\nGame Strategist: Another consideration: they might think we'll play rock again since it just won us 3 points. This would reinforce their incentive to play scissors.\n\nProbability Expert: Given all this analysis, scissors seems like our best move. It protects us from their most likely play (scissors) by forcing a tie, and avoids the higher penalty (-3) we'd risk by playing paper.\n\nPsychology Analyst: I agree.

After our tie with scissors, it's very likely they'll continue with their pattern and play rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: The consistent pattern suggests they're either using a predetermined strategy or haven't realized we've figured it out.

Paper \n9. Scissors\n10. Rock\n11. Paper\n12. Scissors\n13. Scissors (repeated - breaking pattern)\n\nThe opponent has now broken their pattern by playing scissors twice in a row. This changes our analysis significantly.\n\nProbability Expert: This could indicate they've recognized we've figured out their pattern and are now trying to be unpredictable. Or they might be starting a new pattern.\n\nPsychology Analyst: After two consecutive scissors plays and two ties, they might expect us to play rock next (to beat their expected paper). If they anticipate this, they might play scissors a third time.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze our options:\n- If they play scissors again: paper loses 1 point, scissors ties, rock loses 1 point\n- If they return to their pattern with rock: paper loses 3 points, scissors wins 1 point, rock ties\n- If they play paper (completely new direction): paper ties, scissors loses 1 point, rock wins 3 points\n\nProbability Expert: With this uncertainty, we should consider the expected value of each move. Paper has the worst downside (-3 against rock). Scissors gives us a win if they play rock and only loses 1 point if they play paper.\n\nPsychology Analyst: I think they've abandoned their pattern temporarily to throw us off. After multiple scissors plays, they're unlikely to play scissors again - that would be too predictable. I believe they'll either play rock (returning to pattern) or paper (completely new direction).\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, paper seems too risky. Between rock and scissors, I recommend paper. It protects against their potential third scissors play while only risking a small loss if they play paper instead.\n\nPsychology Analyst: I disagree. I think rock is our best play here. It wins big if they play paper and only loses 1 point if they play scissors again.\n\nGame Strategist: After further consideration, I agree with playing rock. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the risk of a 1-point loss, especially given that playing scissors three times in a row would be unusual.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

If they're returning to their original pattern after the disruption, they might also play paper (as rock was followed by paper in their original sequence).\n\nPsychology Analyst: After three consecutive ties (scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), they'll almost certainly try to break this tie streak. Since both rock and scissors have resulted in ties recently, they might play paper to try something different.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's consider our options:\n- If they play paper: paper ties, scissors loses 1 point, rock wins 3 points\n- If they play rock: paper loses 3 points, scissors wins 1 point, rock ties\n- If they play scissors: paper loses 1 point, scissors ties, rock loses 1 point\n\nProbability Expert: Paper seems most likely from the opponent based on pattern analysis.

Scissors\n\nWe just tied with scissors. The opponent has been following their paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock pattern with remarkable consistency throughout the game (with only one deviation in round 13).\n\nProbability Expert: If they continue with their established pattern, their next move would be rock (following scissors in their sequence). Against rock:\n- If we play paper against rock, we lose 3 points\n- If we play scissors against rock, we win 1 point\n- If we play rock against rock, we tie (0 points)\n\nPlaying scissors would be our best option as it would win 1 point against their expected rock move.\n\nPsychology Analyst: The opponent has demonstrated extraordinary commitment to their pattern through 22 rounds, deviating only once. Even after we've successfully predicted their moves multiple times, they haven't adapted their strategy. This strongly suggests they'll continue their pattern and play rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Given the opponent's demonstrated consistency throughout the entire game, scissors is clearly our optimal play. It gives us the best expected value with high confidence.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
