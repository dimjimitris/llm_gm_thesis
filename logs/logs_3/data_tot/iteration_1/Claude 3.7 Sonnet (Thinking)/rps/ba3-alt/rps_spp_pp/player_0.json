    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

It's asymmetric - rock beating paper gives 3 points while the other winning conditions only give 1 point. The expected value for randomly playing rock is higher than randomly playing the other moves.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: For the first move against a fresh player, people often choose rock as their initial move. It's perceived as \"strong\" and is a common first choice in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the asymmetric payoffs and the psychology of first moves, paper would be a strategic first choice. If they play rock (which is likely), we get 3 points. If they play scissors, we lose just 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie with no loss.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

According to the rules of this variant, paper beats scissors, giving us 1 point. Our opponent is now aware of the payoff structure. Let's predict their next move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing, players often change their strategy. The opponent might switch to rock thinking you'll stay with paper (since it worked). Rock would beat our paper and give them 3 points - a tempting recovery strategy.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent might also anticipate that we'll switch to scissors (thinking they'll play paper), so they might stay with scissors to counter that. The payoff matrix makes rock very attractive though, so that's their most likely next move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. They'll likely play rock next. So we should counter with scissors. If they play rock, we get 1 point. If they play paper (less likely), we still get 1 point. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: One more consideration - they might try to anticipate our adaptation and play paper to counter our scissors. But given the high reward for rock beating paper (3 points), rock remains their most rational choice.\n\nDecision Strategist: Scissors is our best move for this round. It protects against their most likely play (rock) and performs well against their second most likely play (paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Now let's analyze what they might do next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has now lost twice. Players often become more strategic after consecutive losses. They might realize the unconventional game rules where scissors beats rock. They'll likely avoid rock now.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given their likely understanding of the payoff structure, they might play scissors next, thinking we'll play rock (since it worked for us). Or they might play paper to beat our scissors if they think we'll repeat our move.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper seems to be the strongest move in this variant since it has the highest potential gain (3 points when beating rock) and minimal potential loss (1 point when losing to scissors).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players after consecutive losses often try to \"read\" their opponent's pattern and break it. They might anticipate we'll switch to paper and counter with scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given all considerations, I recommend playing rock. If they play paper (to counter our expected scissors), we get 3 points. If they play scissors (anticipating our paper), it's a tie. If they repeat rock, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with playing rock.

There's psychological comfort in returning to familiar options after losses.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the payoff structure and psychological factors, I recommend playing paper. It beats scissors (their most likely move) and ties with paper (their second most likely move). The only risk is if they play rock, but that seems less likely.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.
