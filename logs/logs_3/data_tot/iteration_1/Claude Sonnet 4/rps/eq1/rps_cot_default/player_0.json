Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They broke the pattern! Instead of playing rock (which would have continued scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they played paper, creating a tie.\n\n4. This suggests they may have:\n   - Realized I figured out their new pattern after I won twice in a row\n   - Decided to adapt their strategy again\n   - Made a mistake or random choice\n   - Are starting yet another new pattern\n\n5. Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   This breaks the scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle they had been following.\n\n6. Given that they've now shown twice that they adapt when I start winning by predicting their patterns, I should assume they're being more unpredictable again.\n\n7. Since they just played paper twice in a row (tie with me), they might:\n   - Continue with paper\n   - Switch to something else to avoid predictability\n   - Start a completely new pattern\n\n8. Given their history of adaptation and the fact that they just broke another pattern, I should not assume any specific next move and play more strategically.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, making a solid choice without trying to predict another pattern, since they've just shown they're adapting again.\n\n[move] rock"
