Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3.

However, many players tend to start with rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice for beginners.\n\n6.

Critical realization: Maybe the problem isn't that I can't see the pattern - maybe the problem is that they're specifically countering whatever I choose, regardless of what I think their pattern is.\n\n7. At -3 points, I'm in serious trouble. I need to make a decision that breaks whatever dynamic is happening.\n\n8. Since their predicted next move is rock (if the pattern holds), I should play paper. But given my terrible track record, maybe I should do the opposite of what seems logical and play scissors or rock instead.\n\n9. You know what - I'm going to trust the pattern one more time. If they're truly cycling paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then rock is next, and I should play paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, betting on the clear pattern despite my losing streak.\n\n[move] paper"

The last three moves: paper (tie) \u2192 rock (tie) \u2192 scissors (tie)\n   This is extremely suspicious - three consecutive ties is very unlikely by chance.\n\n4. Possible explanations:\n   - They're intentionally copying my moves to force ties\n   - They're using some strategy to mirror or predict my choices\n   - There's some incredible coincidence happening\n   - They might be trying to neutralize the game\n\n5. If they're deliberately copying me, they might:\n   - Continue this mirroring strategy\n   - Have some way of seeing my moves or predicting them\n   - Be trying to force a draw/neutral outcome\n\n6. Three ties in a row suggests this is intentional rather than coincidental.\n\n7. If they're copying my moves, I need to think about what they expect me to play and choose differently.\n\n8. Since we just went paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in our ties, if there's a pattern to their copying, they might expect me to cycle back to paper. But if they're truly mirroring, they'll play whatever I play.\n\n9. I need to make an unpredictable choice that breaks whatever system they might be using.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, going back to the beginning of the recent cycle to see if I can break their mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] rock",

My opponent is either:\n   - Somehow seeing my moves before making theirs\n   - Using a sophisticated prediction method\n   - Deliberately forcing ties for strategic reasons\n   - Has found a way to mirror my choices\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players, which maintains the current score\n   - At -1 points, ties aren't necessarily bad for me compared to losing\n   - But I need to win rounds to improve my position\n\n6. If they're truly mirroring my moves, there might be a delay or method I can exploit.\n\n7. I need to make a completely unpredictable choice that they can't anticipate or mirror.\n\n8.

In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) is theoretically equally likely to be chosen by a random opponent.\n\n4. Since I can't predict my opponent's move, I should choose randomly to avoid being predictable myself.\n\n5. However, many players tend to start with rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice for beginners.\n\n6. If my opponent chooses rock (which is statistically more likely for new players), I should choose paper to win and gain 1 point.\n\n7. This gives me the best chance of winning the first round against a fresh player.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it beats rock, which is commonly chosen by new players in their first move.\n\n[move] paper",

This suggests:\n   - Either I'm misreading the pattern\n   - Or they're deliberately playing a pattern that I can see but can't successfully counter\n   - Or they're counter-predicting my attempts to use the pattern\n\n6. At -3 points with 7 straight losses, I'm in crisis mode. Whatever strategy they're using is completely dominating me.\n\n7. Maybe the key insight is this: if I can see the pattern clearly (paper-rock-scissors cycle), and they know I can see it, then they might be expecting me to play the counter to what the pattern suggests.\n\n8. The pattern suggests they'll play rock next. Normally I'd play paper to beat rock.
