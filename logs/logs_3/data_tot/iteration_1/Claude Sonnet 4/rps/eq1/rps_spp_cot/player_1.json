Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify a clear pattern in my losses:\n   - My scissors losses: rounds 2, 12, 15, 18 (all vs rock)\n   - Every time I've played scissors recently, they've countered with rock\n   - They're clearly predicting when I'll choose scissors\n   - This is a major vulnerability in my strategy\n\n3. Analyze my move effectiveness:\n   - Scissors: 2 wins, 4 losses (very poor recently)\n   - Rock: 4 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie (very strong)\n   - Paper: 2 wins, 1 loss, 2 ties (decent)\n   - My opponent has clearly figured out how to counter scissors\n\n4. Make a tactical adjustment:\n   - I need to avoid scissors until my opponent stops expecting it\n   - Focus on rock and paper where I've had better success\n   - Paper might be the best choice since rock was just successful but could be anticipated next\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Temporarily avoid scissors since it's being consistently countered\n   - Choose paper as an independent choice between my two more successful options\n   - Protect my +2 point lead by playing more tactically\n\n[move] (Making an independent choice while avoiding scissors due to consistent countering) paper"

Evaluate current move effectiveness since round 12:\n   - Scissors: 0 wins, 4 losses (completely neutralized)\n   - Paper: 0 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties (neutralized but not losing)\n   - Rock: 3 wins, 0 losses, 0 ties (still highly effective)\n\n4. Make a strategic decision:\n   - My opponent has adapted well to scissors and paper\n   - Rock remains my most effective weapon\n   - While I don't want to become predictable, rock gives me the best chance to win\n   - I should use rock while it's still working\n\n5.
