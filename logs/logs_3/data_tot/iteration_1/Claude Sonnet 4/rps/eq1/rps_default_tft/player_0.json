    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is now the fourth time they've played rock, and it's interesting that it happened right after their typical \"paper\" position in the sequence.\n\nLooking at the rock pattern:\n- Round 6: rock\n- Round 10: rock  \n- Round 14: rock\n- Round 16: rock\n\nThe spacing is getting shorter (6\u219210\u219214\u219216), and they're using rock more frequently, possibly because they're noticing I'm predicting their moves successfully.\n\nBased on the established pattern, after rock they typically go to paper:\n- Round 6: rock \u2192 paper\n- Round 10: rock \u2192 paper\n- Round 14: rock \u2192 paper\n\nIf this holds, paper should be next. To beat paper, I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
