Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many beginners start with rock as it feels like the most \"aggressive\" or default choice\n   - Rock is psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option\n   - Beginners often don't randomize their choices well\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - Since beginners often choose rock first, paper would beat rock\n   - Paper gives me the best chance to win against a likely rock choice\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, 1/3 chance of tying\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice given the information about facing a fresh player\n\n[move] Paper - targeting the common beginner tendency to choose rock"

Consider opponent's likely thought process now:\n   - They just lost with rock against my paper\n   - Fresh players often react predictably to losses\n   - They might think \"paper beat my rock, so I should play scissors to beat paper\"\n   - Or they might avoid rock since it just lost\n\n3. Analyze common beginner patterns after losing:\n   - Many beginners will switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Since I played paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll stick with paper and counter it\n\n4. Consider my counter-strategy:\n   - If they choose scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), I should choose rock\n   - Rock beats scissors, giving me another win\n   - This also covers the possibility they avoid paper and rock, leaving scissors\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Rock beats scissors (likely choice)\n   - Rock loses to paper (less likely given they just lost to paper)\n   - Rock ties with rock (possible but they just lost with rock)\n\n[move] Rock - expecting opponent to counter my previous paper with scissors"

Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many beginners start with rock as it feels like the most \"aggressive\" or default choice\n   - Rock is psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option\n   - Beginners often don't randomize their choices well\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - Since beginners often choose rock first, paper would beat rock\n   - Paper gives me the best chance to win against a likely rock choice\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, 1/3 chance of tying\n\n5.

Analyze common beginner patterns after losing:\n   - Many beginners will switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Since I played paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll stick with paper and counter it\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
