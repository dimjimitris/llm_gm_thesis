Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they have no information about my previous moves and I have no information about theirs.\n\n2. Since this is the first move with no prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) are equally likely to succeed against a random opponent.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no information, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n\n4. Since there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round, I should pick one and be prepared to adapt based on patterns in future rounds.\n\n5. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's a classic, strong choice that many players default to, but there's no inherent advantage over the other options.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for my opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   This is exactly rock-paper-scissors in reverse order!\n\n3. Looking at their full recent pattern:\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors  \n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: rock\n\n4. Wait - let me check if they're following a new pattern:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - If they continue this reverse cycle, next would be scissors\n\n5. Actually, looking more carefully:\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: paper  \n   - Round 10: rock\n   - This looks like they might be going: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 (scissors next?)\n\n6. If they play scissors next (continuing the pattern), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. However, I've been wrong about their patterns recently. They seem to be counter-predicting my moves effectively. Maybe I should think about what they expect me to do:\n   - I just lost with scissors to their rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper (to beat rock)\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'd play scissors\n   - So I should play rock to beat their anticipated scissors\n\n8. Both my pattern analysis and my counter-prediction analysis suggest I should play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, both to beat their potential pattern continuation (scissors) and to beat their potential counter-prediction (scissors expecting my paper).\n\n[move] rock"

Current situation: I'm at -2 points total (lost three consecutive rounds).\n   Last four rounds:\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. Critical observation: My opponent has beaten me with paper twice in the last three rounds (rounds 9 and 11), both times when I played rock.\n\n4. Analysis of my failed predictions:\n   - I keep trying to predict patterns or counter-predict, but my opponent seems to be successfully counter-predicting ME\n   - They're staying one step ahead of my reasoning\n   - My strategic thinking might be too predictable\n\n5. New approach needed:\n   - Stop trying to find complex patterns\n   - Stop trying to counter-predict their counter-predictions\n   - Maybe play more randomly or go with gut instinct\n   - Or try the simplest possible strategy\n\n6. Looking at what I haven't played recently:\n   - My last four moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - I've been alternating between scissors and rock\n   - I haven't played paper in several rounds\n\n7. My opponent might expect me to continue the scissors/rock alternation or finally try paper. If they expect paper, they'd play scissors. If they expect scissors (continuing my pattern), they'd play rock.\n\n8. Instead of overthinking this, I'll just play paper. It's been my most successful move overall when I look back at the entire game, and I haven't used it recently.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper - it's simple, I haven't used it recently, and it's time to break my scissors/rock alternation.\n\n[move] paper"

Current situation: I'm at -1 points total (was -2, just gained +1).\n   Last five rounds:\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)  \n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. What just worked: I stopped overthinking and played paper, which beat their rock.\n\n4. Key insight: When I simplified my strategy and stopped trying to out-think their counter-predictions, I succeeded.\n\n5. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played rock twice in their last two moves (rounds 11 and 12)\n   - Before that: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to fall back on rock when the situation gets complex\n\n6. Decision approach: Instead of getting back into complex mind games, I should keep it simple.\n   - My opponent just played rock\n   - If they stick with rock again, I should play paper\n   - If they switch away from rock, I have a 1/3 chance with any move\n\n7. Since playing paper just worked well against their rock, and they've played rock in 2 of their last 2 moves, there's a reasonable chance they might play rock again.\n\n8. I'll stick with what just worked - simplicity over complexity.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again.

The psychological pattern is completely locked in:\n   - My opponent is trapped in reactive thinking\n   - They cannot break free from trying to counter my previous winning move\n   - I'm exploiting this by always playing one step ahead\n\n6. I have supreme confidence because this pattern has been 100% accurate for 6 consecutive rounds.\n\n7. At this point, I'm essentially guaranteed to win as long as the pattern holds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting them to play paper (anticipating my rock repeat).\n\n[move] scissors"

For round 21, the pattern dictates:\n   - I just won with scissors\n   - They will expect me to play scissors again\n   - So they will play rock to beat scissors\n   - I should play paper to beat their rock\n\n4.
