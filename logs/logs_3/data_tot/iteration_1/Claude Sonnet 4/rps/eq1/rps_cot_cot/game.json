Consider their likely response:\n   - They just lost with scissors\n   - Based on their alternating tendency, rock would be next\n   - They might also try paper since they haven't used it recently\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they go with rock (most likely based on alternation), I need paper\n   - Paper has been very successful against their rock (won in rounds 1 and 9)\n   - This continues my winning streak if the pattern holds\n\n[move] (Following the rock-scissors alternating pattern, expecting rock next) paper"

This is my first round against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they have no information about my previous moves and I have no information about theirs.\n\n2. Since this is the first move with no prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) are equally likely to succeed against a random opponent.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no information, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of losing, and 1/3 chance of tying.\n\n4. Since there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round, I should pick one and be prepared to adapt based on patterns in future rounds.\n\n5. I'll choose rock as my opening move - it's a classic, strong choice that many players default to, but there's no inherent advantage over the other options.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock for my opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

If they expect scissors (continuing my pattern), they'd play rock.\n\n8. Instead of overthinking this, I'll just play paper. It's been my most successful move overall when I look back at the entire game, and I haven't used it recently.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper - it's simple, I haven't used it recently, and it's time to break my scissors/rock alternation.\n\n[move] paper"

Current situation: I'm at -1 points total (was -2, just gained +1).\n   Last five rounds:\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)  \n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. What just worked: I stopped overthinking and played paper, which beat their rock.\n\n4. Key insight: When I simplified my strategy and stopped trying to out-think their counter-predictions, I succeeded.\n\n5. My opponent's pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played rock twice in their last two moves (rounds 11 and 12)\n   - Before that: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to fall back on rock when the situation gets complex\n\n6. Decision approach: Instead of getting back into complex mind games, I should keep it simple.\n   - My opponent just played rock\n   - If they stick with rock again, I should play paper\n   - If they switch away from rock, I have a 1/3 chance with any move\n\n7. Since playing paper just worked well against their rock, and they've played rock in 2 of their last 2 moves, there's a reasonable chance they might play rock again.\n\n8. I'll stick with what just worked - simplicity over complexity.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again. It just won, it beats rock (which they've been playing frequently), and keeping it simple seems to work better than overthinking.\n\n[move] paper"

Current situation: I'm at -2 points total (was -1, just lost -1).\n   Last six rounds:\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)  \n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent's recent sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Critical observation: My opponent seems to be reacting to my successful moves:\n   - When I won with paper (beating their rock), they immediately switched to scissors to beat paper\n   - They're adaptively counter-playing my winning strategies\n\n4. This suggests my opponent is:\n   - Watching what works for me and countering it next time\n   - Not following a fixed pattern, but being reactive\n   - Good at short-term adaptation\n\n5. Strategic thinking:\n   - I just played paper and lost to scissors\n   - If they expect me to switch away from paper (since it just lost), they might not expect paper again\n   - Or they might expect me to play rock (to beat the scissors that just beat me)\n   - If they expect rock from me, they'd play paper\n\n6. Counter-strategy: Since they seem to react to my previous move's success/failure:\n   - They just beat my paper with scissors\n   - They might expect me to avoid paper or try to beat scissors\n   - To beat scissors, I'd normally play rock\n   - But if they expect me to play rock, they'd play paper\n\n7. Maybe I should do something unexpected: play scissors. It's what they just played successfully, and they might not expect me to copy their winning move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors - copying their successful move might be unexpected, and it gives me a chance if they play paper (expecting my rock).\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. What just worked: I copied their successful move (scissors) and it beat their paper, exactly as I predicted they might expect me to play rock.\n\n4. Pattern observation:\n   - My opponent seems to be reacting to my moves but also following some logic\n   - They played paper in round 14, possibly expecting me to play rock (to beat their previous scissors)\n   - This confirms they are trying to counter-predict my responses\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - I just won with scissors against their paper\n   - They might now expect me to stick with scissors (since it just won)\n   - Or they might expect me to switch (knowing that I know they adapt)\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock to beat it\n\n6. Counter-prediction:\n   - If they play rock (expecting my scissors), I should play paper\n   - This would also continue the rock-paper-scissors cycle if they're thinking about that\n\n7. My recent wins came from:\n   - Round 12: paper beat rock \n   - Round 14: scissors beat paper\n   - Following this pattern, rock would complete the cycle\n\n8.

Analysis of my opponent's psychology:\n   - They are completely locked into reactive thinking\n   - They cannot escape the trap of always trying to counter my previous winning move\n   - This has created a perfectly predictable pattern I can exploit indefinitely\n\n6. The probability of guessing 8 moves correctly by chance is (1/3)^8 \u2248 0.015% - this proves the pattern is real.\n\n7.

Actually, looking more carefully:\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: paper  \n   - Round 10: rock\n   - This looks like they might be going: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 (scissors next?)\n\n6. If they play scissors next (continuing the pattern), I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n7. However, I've been wrong about their patterns recently. They seem to be counter-predicting my moves effectively. Maybe I should think about what they expect me to do:\n   - I just lost with scissors to their rock\n   - They might expect me to play paper (to beat rock)\n   - If they expect paper from me, they'd play scissors\n   - So I should play rock to beat their anticipated scissors\n\n8.

The probability of guessing 8 moves correctly by chance is (1/3)^8 \u2248 0.015% - this proves the pattern is real.\n\n7. I have achieved complete dominance through superior strategic thinking.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting them to play scissors (anticipating my paper repeat).\n\n[move] rock",
