    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), we need to consider their likely behavior patterns. New players often have predictable tendencies: they might choose rock first (it's aggressive and intuitive), or they might overthink and choose something they perceive as \"clever\" like scissors. The key insight is that in a single round against an unknown opponent, there's no historical data to exploit, so we're essentially making a random choice from a game theory perspective.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to exhibit certain psychological patterns. Rock is the most commonly chosen first move because it feels powerful and straightforward - it's literally called \"rock\" and represents strength. Many beginners default to this. However, some players try to be clever and avoid the obvious choice. Since this is our first interaction, I'd recommend choosing paper, as it beats the statistically most likely choice (rock) while also being unexpected enough that if they're trying to counter-predict, they might choose scissors thinking we'll go with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on both perspectives, it seems paper is our best strategic choice. The Game Theorist confirms there's no exploitable pattern yet, so we're making an educated guess. The Psychology Expert provides compelling evidence that fresh players often choose rock first. Paper beats rock, giving us the best chance for a +1 point start.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Paper is the optimal choice given the information we have. It capitalizes on the most likely opponent behavior while maintaining the symmetric Nash equilibrium property of the game.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - targeting the most statistically likely first move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theorist:** Excellent! Our prediction was correct - the opponent chose rock as expected for a fresh player. Now we have valuable data: they chose rock in round 1. This creates a new strategic consideration. Some players will stick with their first choice if it lost (stubbornness or thinking \"it has to work eventually\"), while others will switch. There's also the meta-game consideration - they might think we'll expect them to switch and therefore stick with rock, or they might switch to scissors thinking we'll play paper again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is where behavioral patterns become crucial. After losing with rock, the opponent has several psychological responses: 1) Frustration might make them stick with rock (doubling down), 2) They might switch to scissors to counter our winning paper, or 3) They might go to paper thinking we'll switch to rock. However, there's a common pattern where players who lose tend to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move - so they might choose scissors now. But there's also the \"gambler's fallacy\" where they think rock is \"due\" to win.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, what's our best counter-strategy? If they're likely to choose scissors (countering our paper), we should choose rock. If they stick with rock again, we should choose paper again. The psychology suggests they're more likely to switch than repeat.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree with your reasoning. The probability distribution has shifted. They're most likely to choose scissors (attempting to counter our successful paper), making rock our optimal response. If they stick with rock, we at least tie rather than lose.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Rock is the right call. The switching behavior after a loss is very common, and specifically switching to counter the opponent's winning move is a typical amateur response.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - expecting opponent to switch to scissors to counter our winning paper move.\n\n[move] Rock"

Now we have a clear pattern: Round 1 - Opponent chose rock (lost), Round 2 - Opponent chose scissors (lost). This gives us valuable behavioral data. The opponent is showing a predictable switching pattern - they're rotating through the moves after each loss. If this pattern continues, they should choose paper next (the only move they haven't tried yet).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is textbook amateur behavior - they're cycling through all three options systematically after each loss, likely thinking this gives them better odds or trying to \"cover all bases.\" This is actually a very common psychological response called \"systematic exploration\" when people feel like they need to \"try everything.\" Given they went rock \u2192 scissors, paper is the logical next choice in their mental rotation. They might also be thinking \"I haven't tried paper yet, maybe that will work.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they choose paper next (which seems highly probable based on the systematic cycling pattern), we should choose scissors to beat paper. This would give us a 3-0 lead and continue our perfect prediction streak.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Absolutely correct. The pattern recognition gives us a significant edge here. Scissors beats paper, and based on their demonstrated behavior, paper is by far the most likely choice. Even if they break the pattern, we're making the statistically optimal choice based on available data.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I strongly agree. The cycling behavior is so consistent that deviating from our counter-strategy would be ignoring clear behavioral evidence. Scissors is definitely the right call.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - expecting opponent to complete their systematic cycle with paper after rock and scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theorist:** Incredible! We're 3-0 with perfect predictions. The opponent has now shown a complete systematic cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, and we've countered each perfectly. This level of predictability is remarkable. Now the key question is: will they continue this cycle (going back to rock), or will they realize their pattern is being exploited and try to break it? From a game theory perspective, rational players should randomize, but this opponent has shown highly irrational, predictable behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a critical psychological moment. The opponent has now lost three times in a row using a systematic approach. They're likely experiencing significant frustration and cognitive dissonance. There are several possible responses: 1) Continue the cycle (rock next) due to habit/stubbornness, 2) Break the pattern randomly due to frustration, 3) Try to \"outsmart\" us by doing something unexpected. However, given their consistent systematic behavior so far, they may not even realize they're being predictable - they might think it's just bad luck. The psychological momentum suggests they'll likely continue the cycle with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern has been rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, so if they continue cycling, rock should be next. We should choose paper to beat rock. However, there's now a meta-consideration: might they realize they're being predictable and deliberately break the pattern?\n\n**Game Theorist:** That's the crucial question. Given their behavior shows no adaptation after three losses, they seem to lack pattern recognition of their own behavior. I'd estimate a 70% chance they stick with rock (continuing the cycle), 30% they break pattern. Paper is still our best bet.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with those odds. Three losses without adaptation suggests they're not consciously recognizing their pattern. The psychological inertia strongly favors continuing the cycle. Paper is the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - expecting opponent to continue their systematic cycle with rock after completing the rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper sequence.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theorist:** Fascinating! The opponent broke their cycle for the first time. Instead of going rock (which would have continued the rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock pattern), they chose paper - the same as us. This is a significant behavioral shift after 3 rounds of systematic cycling. They either: 1) Randomly deviated from their pattern, 2) Started recognizing they were being predicted and tried to disrupt our strategy, or 3) Are beginning a new pattern. The tie might have given them confidence or made them think paper is a \"safe\" choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a crucial psychological turning point. After three consecutive losses, they finally didn't lose - they achieved a tie. This might reinforce their choice of paper in their mind as \"successful\" compared to their previous moves. There's a psychological phenomenon called \"partial reinforcement\" where even a neutral outcome (tie) after repeated failures can feel like a victory. They might stick with paper again, thinking it \"worked\" this time, or they might interpret this as breaking their losing streak and try something else.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have several possibilities: 1) They stick with paper (feeling it was successful), 2) They return to their cycle pattern with rock, 3) They continue trying to break patterns with random choices. What's our best counter-strategy?\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given the psychological impact of the tie, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with paper again (maybe 40%), moderate chance they'll go to rock (continuing original cycle - 35%), and some chance of scissors (random/anti-pattern - 25%). If they choose paper again, we want scissors. If rock, we want paper. If scissors, we want rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean more heavily toward them repeating paper. The psychological relief of not losing might make them think \"paper works\" and stick with it. The partial reinforcement effect is powerful. I'd say 50% paper, 30% rock, 20% scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given both analyses suggest paper is most likely, scissors is our optimal choice to counter it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - targeting the most likely repeat of paper due to psychological reinforcement from the tie.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent's sequence is now: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They've completely abandoned their original systematic cycle and seem to be in a new behavioral phase. Two ties in a row might feel like \"progress\" to them after three straight losses. The pattern now shows they repeated paper once, then switched to scissors. This suggests they might be entering a more random or reactive phase, possibly trying to mirror or counter-predict our moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive ties represent a major psychological shift for the opponent. After three losses followed by two ties, they're likely feeling much more confident and less predictable. The fact they chose scissors (the same as us) suggests a few possibilities: 1) They're unconsciously mirroring our choices, 2) They're trying to \"match\" us strategically, 3) They're becoming more random due to increased confidence. The sequential repetition (paper twice in positions 3-4, then scissors in position 5 matching us) might indicate they're starting to focus on what we're doing rather than following their own internal pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they went from systematic cycling to potentially reactive/mimicking behavior. If they're starting to mirror or try to predict our moves, what should we expect next? And how do we counter reactive behavior?\n\n**Game Theorist:** If they're becoming reactive to our moves, they might try to predict what we'll do next. They might think: \"They played scissors last, so they might play rock to beat scissors if they think I'll play scissors again.\" This creates a complex meta-game. However, given their history of not being highly strategic, they might simply repeat scissors again (thinking it \"worked\" with a tie) or randomly choose.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The confidence from two ties might lead them to repeat scissors again, thinking they've \"figured something out.\" Alternatively, they might try to be clever and switch. But given their demonstrated level of strategic thinking, I lean toward them either repeating scissors (40%) or choosing rock (35%) or paper (25%) somewhat randomly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If scissors is most likely (40%), we should choose rock to beat it. Even if they choose rock (35%), we tie rather than lose.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - targeting the most likely repeat of scissors while providing good coverage against their other probable choices.\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent's full sequence is now: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. They repeated scissors twice (rounds 5-6), which confirms they were indeed influenced by the tie in round 5. This gives us more insight into their psychology - they tend to repeat moves that don't result in losses. Now they've lost again with scissors, so they'll likely switch away from it. Given their history, they might return to paper (which gave them a tie) or try rock (which they haven't used since round 1).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just experienced another loss after feeling confident from the ties. This psychological \"setback\" after progress will likely make them abandon scissors and return to something that felt safer. Paper gave them a tie in round 4, so there's a strong chance they'll return to it. Rock is also possible since it's been a while since they tried it (round 1). The pattern shows they tend to avoid moves that just lost - so scissors is unlikely for round 7.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at their behavior: they avoid moves that just lost, and gravitate toward moves that previously didn't lose. Paper (tied in round 4) and rock (haven't used since round 1, so might feel \"fresh\") are the most likely. If I had to choose the most probable, I'd say paper due to the recent positive association.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree with that analysis. Paper is probably 45% likely, rock about 35%, and scissors only 20% since it just lost. If they choose paper, we want scissors to beat it. That's our best strategic choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, the psychological tendency to return to previously \"successful\" (non-losing) moves strongly points to paper. The recent tie with paper in round 4 will feel much more appealing than the recent loss with scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - expecting opponent to return to paper, which previously resulted in a tie and feels \"safer\" after their recent loss with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent's complete sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. This confirms our psychological analysis perfectly - they returned to paper after losing with scissors, just as we predicted. Now they've lost with paper again, so they'll likely abandon it. Looking at their pattern, they seem to cycle through options but avoid the move that just lost. Since paper just lost, they'll likely choose either rock or scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is showing very predictable avoidance behavior - they consistently move away from whatever just caused them to lose. Paper just lost, so they'll avoid it. They have two options: rock (last used in round 1, so it might feel \"fresh\" and untainted) or scissors (which they used recently in rounds 5-6, with mixed results - one tie, one loss). The psychological tendency would be to try rock since it's been \"resting\" the longest and doesn't have recent negative associations.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're expecting them to avoid paper (just lost) and choose between rock and scissors. Given their pattern of returning to moves that haven't been used recently or had negative outcomes, rock seems more likely since they haven't tried it since round 1. If they choose rock, we should play paper.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Exactly right. Rock is probably 55% likely, scissors about 35%, and paper only 10% due to recency bias against the losing move. Paper beats rock and gives us the best expected value.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with those probabilities. The \"fresh start\" psychology strongly favors rock.

This confirms our pattern recognition: they consistently avoid moves that just lost and return to moves that feel \"safe\" or haven't been used recently. Rock just lost again (like in round 1), so they'll likely abandon it. They now have scissors and paper as options, both of which have recent mixed associations.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just experienced another loss with rock, which will create negative reinforcement against using it again. Now they're in a tricky psychological position - paper lost in round 7, rock just lost in round 8. Scissors had mixed results (tie in round 5, loss in round 6). Given their avoidance pattern, they might return to scissors since it's the \"least recently failed\" option, or they might go back to paper since some time has passed since its last loss (round 7). However, scissors might feel safer since it achieved a tie more recently.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Looking at their psychology: rock just lost (avoid), paper lost in round 7 (some recency bias against it), scissors had a tie in round 5 and loss in round 6 (mixed but not immediately negative). They seem to have short-term memory bias, so scissors might be most appealing since the tie in round 5 was their last \"success\" with it.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree.

The opponent's complete sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. Our pattern recognition has been nearly flawless. The opponent just lost with scissors again, so they'll definitely avoid it. Looking at their options: paper (lost in round 7, but some time has passed) and rock (lost in round 8, more recent negative association). Given their consistent avoidance of recently failed moves, paper seems more likely since its failure is less recent than rock's.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a fascinating case study in predictable human behavior under pressure. The opponent has now lost with scissors twice (rounds 6 and 9), so they'll have strong negative associations with it. Rock failed in round 8, which is very recent. Paper failed in round 7, but that's two rounds ago now, which might feel \"distant enough\" to try again. Their psychological pattern shows they have roughly a 2-round memory for negative associations. Paper is definitely the most likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is crystal clear now: they avoid moves that just lost, and gravitate toward moves that either haven't been used recently or whose failures feel \"distant.\" Paper lost 2 rounds ago (round 7), rock lost 1 round ago (round 8), scissors just lost. Paper is definitely most appealing psychologically.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed completely. Paper is probably 60% likely, rock about 25% (despite recent loss, they might think it's \"due\"), and scissors only 15% (too much recent negative reinforcement). If they choose paper, we want scissors to beat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The 2-round cooling-off period for paper makes it feel \"safe\" again. Scissors is our optimal response to capitalize on this predictable pattern.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - expecting opponent to return to paper, which feels psychologically \"safe\" again after a 2-round gap since its last failure.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Our behavioral model is holding perfectly. They just lost with paper again, so they'll avoid it. This leaves rock (lost in round 8) and scissors (lost in round 9). Both have recent negative associations, but scissors is more recent. Rock might feel like the \"fresher\" option despite losing in round 8.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** We've now confirmed the opponent has a consistent 2-round psychological memory for avoiding failed moves. Paper just failed (avoid), scissors failed in round 9 (very recent, avoid), rock failed in round 8 (2 rounds ago, might feel acceptable again). The pattern is so clear: they cycle back to moves after roughly 2 rounds of avoidance. Rock is overwhelmingly likely - it's the only option that fits their psychological avoidance pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The logic is ironclad. Paper just lost (immediate avoidance), scissors lost in round 9 (recent avoidance), rock lost in round 8 (2-round cooling period complete, feels \"safe\" again). Based on their demonstrated 2-round memory pattern, rock is almost certain.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I'd put rock at 70% probability, scissors at 20% (they might break pattern due to desperation), and paper at 10% (too recent to overcome avoidance). Paper beats rock, so that's clearly our optimal play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The psychological momentum is overwhelming toward rock. It's the only choice that doesn't trigger their immediate avoidance response.
