My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n14. They finally broke their paper pattern! After 4 consecutive papers, they switched to rock.\n15. This shows they ARE capable of adapting and learning - they realized I was consistently beating their paper with scissors.\n16. Now they've used rock in rounds 5 and 11 - both times it was successful (won round 5, won round 11).\n17. They might think rock is their new winning strategy, especially since it just worked.\n18. Or they might think I'll expect them to repeat rock and choose accordingly.\n19. Looking at their overall pattern: paper (6 times), scissors (3 times), rock (2 times).\n20. They clearly favor paper overall, but they've now shown they can break patterns when losing consistently.\n21. After successfully switching from paper to rock and winning, they might:\n    - Stick with rock (since it just worked)\n    - Switch back to paper (their overall favorite)\n    - Try scissors (to complete a cycle or be unpredictable)\n22. Given that rock just gave them a victory after a string of paper losses, I think they're likely to try rock again.\n23. If they choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their likely repeat of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

They chose rock twice in a row (rounds 11 and 12), similar to how they did paper 4 times in a row.\n16. This suggests they might be settling into rock as their new pattern, just like they did with paper.\n17. However, they just lost with rock in round 12, so they might reconsider.\n18. Their overall distribution: paper (6 times), scissors (3 times), rock (3 times now).\n19. They've shown a tendency to stick with moves that work, but also to eventually switch when they keep losing.\n20. After two rocks and losing the second one, they might:\n    - Try rock a third time (continuing the new pattern)\n    - Switch back to paper (their historical favorite)\n    - Try scissors (the least used recently)\n21. Given their pattern behavior, they often stick with a move for multiple rounds before switching.\n22. Since rock just failed, they might abandon it and go back to their comfort zone of paper.\n23. They used paper successfully in round 7 (their only win besides the recent rock in round 11), so they might return to it.\n24. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors.\n25. If they stick with rock for a third time, I should choose paper again.\n26.

Even when losing, they tend to persist with their chosen streak for multiple rounds.\n12. They've only tried scissors twice so far, and given their pattern of extended streaks, they're likely to continue.\n13. The question is whether losing twice in a row with scissors will make them abandon it faster than their previous streaks.\n14. But looking at their rock streak - they had losses but kept going for 6 total rounds.\n15. Their behavioral pattern suggests they give each move several attempts before switching.\n16. Since they just started the scissors streak and have only tried it twice, they're likely to try it a third time.\n17.

At this point, my opponent must be extremely frustrated and likely feeling completely outplayed.\n11. When someone is this frustrated and behind, they often either:\n    - Panic and stick with what feels safe (scissors seems to be their go-to)\n    - Try something completely different in desperation\n    - Give up on strategy and just pick randomly\n12. However, I notice scissors has appeared in 50% of their moves (3 out of 6 rounds).\n13. After being beaten so consistently, they might be thinking I have their number completely.\n14. They might try to break the cycle by avoiding scissors, or they might default to it again under pressure.\n15. If they avoid scissors, they'll choose between rock and paper. Given I just used rock successfully, they might try paper to beat a repeated rock.\n16.

With their rock streak, their record is: win, loss, win, loss, tie, loss - so they've lost 3 out of the last 6 with rock.\n9. They just lost again with rock in round 16, making it their 3rd loss with rock.\n10. Looking at their behavioral pattern: they switched away from paper after losing multiple times with it.\n11. Now they've lost 3 times with rock in their 6-rock streak, including the most recent round.\n12. This might finally be the breaking point where they abandon rock, just like they abandoned paper.\n13. If they switch away from rock, they have two options:\n    - Return to paper (their original favorite, 6 times total)\n    - Try scissors (their least used move, only 3 times total)\n14. Given that they've shown a pattern of creating long streaks with different moves, and scissors is their most underused option, they might start a scissors streak.\n15. Alternatively, they might return to paper since it was their historically most successful move.\n16. However, their pattern suggests they like to try new dominant strategies rather than return to old ones immediately.\n17. I think they're most likely to switch to scissors after this failed rock streak.\n18. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat it.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely switch to scissors after the failed rock streak.\n\n[move] (After 6 rocks in a row with recent losses, they're likely to switch to their underused scissors) rock",

This confirms their behavioral pattern: they create long streaks with one move, then switch to a different move for a new streak.\n8. They went from 4 papers in a row, to 6 rocks in a row, and now they might start a scissors streak.\n9. Scissors appeared in rounds 2, 3, 6, and now 17 - so it's been their least dominant move until now.\n10. Given their pattern of sticking with moves for multiple rounds once they switch to them, they might choose scissors again.\n11. However, they just lost with scissors in round 17, which might make them reconsider immediately.\n12. But looking at their rock streak - they continued with rock even after losses, sticking with it for 6 rounds total.\n13. Similarly, they stuck with paper for 4 rounds despite some losses.\n14. This suggests they don't abandon a move after just one loss - they tend to give it multiple tries.\n15. Since they just switched to scissors and it's their new choice after abandoning rock, they're likely to try scissors again.\n16. If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock to beat it.\n17. Their behavioral pattern strongly suggests they'll stick with scissors for at least a few more rounds before potentially switching again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely second consecutive scissors as they start a new streak pattern.\n\n[move] (They just switched from rock to scissors and tend to create multi-round streaks with new moves) rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoff structure is standard: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, with +1 for winning and -1 for losing.\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what a \"fresh player\" might do.\n4. Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns - they frequently choose rock as their first move since it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat rock and earn +1 points.\n6. Even if I'm wrong about their tendency, paper is a solid choice since it has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common tendency of new players to start with rock.\n\n[move] paper",

When people are highly stressed or frustrated in games like this, they often:\n    - Revert to their most instinctive choice\n    - Try to overthink and counter what they think I expect\n    - Become more random, but still lean toward familiar patterns\n12. Scissors has appeared 3 times in their sequence (most frequent), paper appeared 2 times, and rock only once.\n13. Given their tendency to return to scissors when losing, they might stick with it again, or they might try to break the pattern with paper or rock.\n14. Since I just beat their scissors with rock, they might expect me to repeat rock and therefore choose paper.\n15. But they might also think I'm anticipating that logic and choose scissors to beat my expected paper.\n16. Given their clear tendency toward scissors when under pressure, I should probably counter with rock again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again, betting on their pattern of returning to scissors under pressure.\n\n[move] rock",

They've now chosen paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 7, 8, 9, 10)!\n14. This is an extremely strong pattern - paper has appeared 6 times out of 10 rounds (60% of the time).\n15. My opponent seems completely locked into paper as their dominant strategy.\n16. After losing with paper for the second time in a row (rounds 8 and 10), they might finally realize they need to change.\n17. However, their behavior suggests they might be:\n    - Panicking and defaulting to their \"comfort\" choice\n    - Stubbornly sticking with what they think should work\n    - Not adapting well to being outplayed\n18. The question is: will they finally break this paper pattern after 4 consecutive losses/ties with it, or continue the streak?\n19. If they stick with paper again (5th in a row), scissors beats it.\n20. If they finally switch, they'll likely go to rock or scissors.\n21. Given their extreme commitment to paper recently, I think there's still a high chance they'll choose paper again, despite the recent failures.\n22. Their pattern suggests they're not adapting quickly to losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors again to beat their likely fifth consecutive paper choice.\n\n[move] scissors",

After losing with paper again in round 10, they must realize they're being too predictable.\n\n7. They might finally break this paper streak because:\n   - They've lost twice in a row with paper (rounds 8 and 10)\n   - Four consecutive papers is very obvious\n   - They might be frustrated with their predictability\n\n8. If they switch, they'll likely go to either:\n   - Scissors (to beat my expected paper, since I might think they'll continue the pattern)\n   - Rock (their least recently used move)\n\n9. However, their psychological attachment to paper has been very strong lately.\n\n10. There's still a chance they stick with paper again (fifth time in a row) out of stubbornness or habit.\n\n11. But the smart money is on them finally switching after this obvious pattern.\n\n12. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper.\n\n13. Given that rock appeared less recently than scissors in their pattern, and they might want to try something \"different,\" I think rock is more likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their likely switch to rock after the long paper streak.\n\n[move] paper",

They've now chosen rock FOUR times in a row (rounds 11, 12, 13, 14)!\n18. This exactly mirrors their earlier paper streak of 4 consecutive rounds.\n19. They're showing extremely predictable pattern behavior - they get locked into one move for extended periods.\n20. Rock won them 2 out of 4 attempts (rounds 11 and 13), but they just lost again in round 14.\n21. Their overall distribution: paper (6 times), scissors (3 times), rock (5 times now).\n22. Based on their previous behavior with the paper streak, after losing multiple times with the same move in their streak, they eventually switched.\n23. They stuck with paper through 4 rounds despite mixed results, then finally switched to rock.\n24. Now they've done 4 rocks and just lost the most recent one.\n25. Following their established pattern, they might:\n    - Try rock a 5th time (continuing the streak like they did with paper)\n    - Finally break the rock pattern and switch (like they eventually did with paper)\n26. Given that they just lost with rock and have now lost 2 out of the last 3 rock attempts, they might finally switch.\n27. If they switch, they'll likely go back to their historical favorites: paper or scissors.\n28. Paper was their original dominant choice, so they might return to it.\n29. However, they might also try scissors since it's been their least used recently.\n\nFinal decision: I think they'll finally break the rock streak and switch to scissors. I'll choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

They are clearly a creature of habit who establishes long streaks with one move.\n20. Rock has been moderately successful for them: won rounds 11 and 13, lost rounds 12 and 14.\n21.

Looking at their switching behavior: they went from 4 papers to rock. They might now go from 4 rocks to scissors.\n24. Scissors would also make sense as a counter if they think I'll expect another rock and choose paper again.\n25. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat it.\n26.

Now they've lost 3 times with rock in their 6-rock streak, including the most recent round.\n12. This might finally be the breaking point where they abandon rock, just like they abandoned paper.\n13. If they switch away from rock, they have two options:\n    - Return to paper (their original favorite, 6 times total)\n    - Try scissors (their least used move, only 3 times total)\n14. Given that they've shown a pattern of creating long streaks with different moves, and scissors is their most underused option, they might start a scissors streak.\n15. Alternatively, they might return to paper since it was their historically most successful move.\n16.

This confirms they're starting a scissors streak, just like they did with paper (4 in a row) and rock (6 in a row).\n8. However, they've lost both times with scissors so far (rounds 17 and 18).\n9. Looking at their previous streaks:\n   - Paper streak: had some wins and losses mixed in, but they stuck with it for 4 rounds\n   - Rock streak: had wins and losses mixed in, but they stuck with it for 6 rounds\n10. Even when losing with a move, they tend to persist with it for multiple rounds before switching.\n11. Since they just started the scissors pattern and have only tried it twice, they're likely to continue despite the losses.\n12. Their behavioral pattern shows they don't give up on a move quickly - they commit to streaks.\n13. I expect them to choose scissors for a third time, continuing their new streak.\n14. If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock to beat it.\n15.
