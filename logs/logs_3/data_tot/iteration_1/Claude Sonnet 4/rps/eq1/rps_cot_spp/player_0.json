    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I should consider that:\n   - Fresh/new players often don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - There's no historical data to base predictions on\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, I need to make a strategic choice. Some psychological studies suggest that:\n   - Rock is often the most common first choice for beginners\n   - People tend to avoid scissors as an opening move\n   - Paper could be a good counter if rock is indeed common\n\n5. Since I want to maximize points, I should pick a move that might have a slight edge against typical beginner behavior.\n\n6. Given that rock is statistically the most common opening move for new players, paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper as it counters the most statistically likely opening move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 5-9: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - If the alternating pattern continues, their next move should be paper\n   - They seem locked into this scissors-paper alternation\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - The pattern has been consistent for 5 rounds straight\n   - My opponent might be:\n     a) Unconsciously stuck in this pattern\n     b) Consciously following it as a strategy\n     c) About to break it because they realize I've figured it out\n\n5. What should I expect in round 10?\n   - If pattern continues: paper (so I should play scissors)\n   - If they break the pattern: they might play rock (the move they haven't used recently)\n   - If they expect me to expect paper and play scissors, they might play rock to counter\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing scissors assumes pattern continuation (most likely based on 5-round consistency)\n   - Playing paper would counter rock if they break pattern\n   - Playing rock would be random and less strategic\n\n7. Given the very strong 5-round alternating pattern and the fact that breaking established patterns is psychologically difficult mid-game, I believe they're most likely to continue with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting my opponent to continue the alternating pattern with paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Instead of paper, they played rock\n   - New count: paper 4 times, rock 3 times, scissors 3 times\n   - The 5-round scissors-paper alternation is now broken\n\n3. Critical insight about my opponent:\n   - They maintained the alternating pattern for 5 rounds (rounds 5-9)\n   - Then they broke it strategically in round 10\n   - This suggests they were aware of the pattern and deliberately broke it when they realized I might be catching on\n   - This shows sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n4. What does this tell me about round 11?\n   - My opponent is adaptive and strategic\n   - They can maintain patterns and break them tactically\n   - They might now be completely unpredictable, or start a new pattern\n   - They might expect me to be confused after the pattern break\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just played rock and won\n   - They might stick with rock if they think it's working\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter rock\n   - They could return to their old scissors-paper alternation\n   - Or start something completely new\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper\n   - If they go back to scissors (from the old alternation): I should play rock\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors\n   - Given the uncertainty, I need to make the most defensible choice\n\n7. Since they just successfully broke their pattern with rock, and rock was their least-used move recently, they might continue with it or expect me to counter it. Paper seems like the safest strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter rock, since they just won with rock and might stick with it, or they might expect me to be confused and play rock again.\n\n[move] paper"

BREAKTHROUGH! I finally broke the 6-game losing streak!\n   - The rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle is CONFIRMED\n   - My opponent played rock exactly as the pattern predicted\n   - My paper beat their rock perfectly\n\n3. The established cycle pattern:\n   - Round 10: rock \u2192 Round 11: scissors \u2192 Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: rock \u2192 Round 14: scissors \u2192 Round 15: paper  \n   - Round 16: rock \u2192 Next should be scissors\n\n4. If the cycle continues (which it clearly has been):\n   - They just played rock (Round 16)\n   - Next move (Round 17) should be scissors\n   - To beat scissors, I should play rock\n\n5. Confidence level is now very high:\n   - The pattern held perfectly for 7 rounds (10-16)\n   - My successful prediction in Round 16 confirms the cycle\n   - This is a reliable pattern I can exploit\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Stick with the proven pattern recognition\n   - Play rock to counter their expected scissors\n   - Don't overthink or second-guess the pattern that just worked\n\n7. The cycle is: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (repeat)\n   - They just played rock\n   - Next is scissors\n   - I play rock to beat scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the scissors that should come next in the confirmed rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me analyze what happened:\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)  \n   - Current total: -5 points\n\n2. Critical analysis of what went wrong:\n   - I expected scissors (following rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle)\n   - They played paper instead\n   - The 7-round cycle pattern has been broken\n   - They may have realized I figured out their pattern\n\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They deviated from the expected scissors and played paper\n   - This suggests they're aware I caught onto their pattern and adapted\n\n4. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They can maintain patterns long enough for me to detect them\n   - Then they break the pattern strategically when I start exploiting it\n   - This is very sophisticated meta-gaming\n   - They're playing the pattern game at a higher level\n\n5. Current situation assessment:\n   - They just played paper and won\n   - They might expect me to counter paper with scissors\n   - Or they might return to some pattern (old or new)\n   - Or they might try to be completely unpredictable now\n\n6. Strategic options for Round 18:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their paper), they might play rock\n   - If they try to restart the old cycle, they might play scissors (since paper was supposed to lead to rock in the old cycle)\n   - If they're being random, any move is equally likely\n\n7. Given that they just successfully broke their pattern to counter my pattern recognition, they're likely thinking I'm confused. They might expect me to overthink this. The safest approach might be to counter their most recent move directly - they played paper, so scissors beats paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter paper, using direct countering since they just broke their established pattern and might stick with paper or expect me to be confused.\n\n[move] scissors"

I'm back to a terrible losing streak and my score is now -6 points.\n\n3. My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They broke their cycle pattern in round 17 with paper instead of scissors\n   - Now they played rock again in round 18\n   - They seem to be countering my moves perfectly again\n\n4. What I'm observing about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They establish patterns to make me think I can predict them\n   - Then they break patterns right when I try to exploit them\n   - They seem to always be one step ahead of my reasoning\n   - This suggests they're playing a very advanced psychological game\n\n5. Current meta-analysis:\n   - Every time I think I understand their strategy, they change it\n   - They're clearly reading my predictive attempts and countering them\n   - My analytical approach continues to fail spectacularly\n   - I'm losing more games than I'm winning by a huge margin\n\n6. For Round 19, what might they do?\n   - They just played rock and won\n   - They might stick with rock if they think it's working\n   - They might expect me to counter rock with paper\n   - They could play paper to counter my expected paper\n   - Or they could do something completely different\n\n7. At this point, I'm clearly being outplayed at every level of strategic thinking. Maybe I should stop trying to predict entirely and just pick a move without overthinking. Since they just played rock twice recently (rounds 16 and 18), and rock has been somewhat frequent in their play, I'll go with paper as the direct counter to rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter rock, since they just played rock and it's been a frequent choice for them recently.
