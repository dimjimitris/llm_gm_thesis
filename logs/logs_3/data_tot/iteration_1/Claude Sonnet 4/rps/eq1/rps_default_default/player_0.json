The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This is quite remarkable and suggests we're thinking very similarly.\n\nMy opponent's recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They went from paper back to rock, so their pattern seems to be: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (not completing the full cycle to scissors).\n\nLooking at this recent pattern, after playing rock twice in recent rounds (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they might:\n- Switch to paper (alternating rock/paper)\n- Try scissors (haven't used it in a while)\n- Continue with rock (they've been favoring it)\n\nGiven their recent rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock pattern, and the fact that we just tied on rock, I think they might switch to paper next (continuing the rock/paper alternation they've shown recently). I'll play scissors to beat paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They're really favoring rock lately - they've played it 3 times in the last 4 moves.\n\nThis suggests they might have developed a preference for rock, or they're trying to establish a pattern where they use rock frequently. Since they just played rock twice in a row and have been using it a lot, they might:\n- Continue with rock (third time in a row)\n- Switch to paper (classic cycle after rock)\n- Try scissors (haven't used it recently)\n\nGiven their strong recent preference for rock (5 times in the last 7 moves), and the fact that they just played it twice consecutively, there's a good chance they'll stick with rock again. I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n[move] paper"
