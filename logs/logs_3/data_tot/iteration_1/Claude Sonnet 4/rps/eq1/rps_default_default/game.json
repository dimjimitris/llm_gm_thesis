My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They switched from rock to paper, and I correctly anticipated this with scissors.\n\nLooking at their pattern:\n- They had been favoring rock recently (3 out of 4 moves)\n- Then switched to paper (which follows rock in the classic cycle)\n- This suggests they might continue with the cycle pattern\n\nIf they follow the cycle after paper, scissors would be next. But they might also:\n- Return to rock (which they've been favoring)\n- Repeat paper\n- Try to counter-predict my next move\n\nSince I just won with scissors beating their paper, they might expect me to repeat scissors or move to rock (next in cycle). They could play rock to beat potential scissors from me.\n\nGiven their recent rock preference and the fact that rock would beat scissors (if they think I might repeat my winning move), I'll play paper to beat rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock. They're really favoring rock lately - they've played it 3 times in the last 4 moves.\n\nThis suggests they might have developed a preference for rock, or they're trying to establish a pattern where they use rock frequently. Since they just played rock twice in a row and have been using it a lot, they might:\n- Continue with rock (third time in a row)\n- Switch to paper (classic cycle after rock)\n- Try scissors (haven't used it recently)\n\nGiven their strong recent preference for rock (5 times in the last 7 moves), and the fact that they just played it twice consecutively, there's a good chance they'll stick with rock again. I should play paper to beat rock.\n\n[move] paper",

They've now played rock 3 times in the last 4 moves, showing a strong preference for rock lately.\n\nThis is interesting because:\n1. They seem to be in a \"rock phase\" \n2. Rock just beat my scissors, so they might stick with what's working\n3. They could also switch since rock has been so dominant in their recent play\n\nTheir overall pattern shows they tend to go through phases:\n- Initial cycle phase\n- Scissors repetition phase  \n- Recent rock-heavy phase\n\nSince they just won with rock and have been favoring it heavily, they might:\n- Continue with rock (it's working)\n- Switch to paper (next in cycle, or to vary from too much rock)\n- Try scissors (haven't used it recently)\n\nGiven their recent rock dominance and the fact that rock just won, I think there's a good chance they'll either stick with rock or move to paper. I'll play paper - it beats rock and ties with paper, giving me good odds either way.\n\n[move] paper",
