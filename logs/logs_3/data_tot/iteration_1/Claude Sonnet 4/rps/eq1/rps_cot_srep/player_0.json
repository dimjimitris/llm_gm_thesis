    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure: This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with a clear payoff matrix where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to exactly one other move.\n\n2. Consider my opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they are new/inexperienced, which might make their play patterns more predictable or random.\n\n3. Evaluate opening move strategy: \n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - Many beginners choose rock because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Paper beats rock, so choosing paper could be advantageous against a typical beginner pattern\n\n4. Risk assessment: \n   - If opponent chooses rock, I win with paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose with paper (-1 point) \n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Decision reasoning: Given that fresh players statistically tend to favor rock in opening moves, and paper beats rock, this seems like the optimal choice for maximizing my expected value in this first round.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the previous round result:\n   - My prediction was correct - the fresh player chose rock\n   - I won with paper, confirming the opponent may follow predictable beginner patterns\n\n2.

Evaluate opponent psychology:\n   - Beginners often overcorrect after a loss\n   - They may assume I'll repeat my winning move (paper)\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they'd choose scissors to counter it\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (expecting me to repeat paper), I should choose rock\n   - If opponent switches to paper (copying my winning move), I should choose scissors\n   - If opponent sticks with rock (stubborn/random), I should choose paper again\n\n5.

Evaluate opponent behavior:\n   - This \"fresh player\" seems to have a strong preference for rock\n   - They didn't switch after losing in round 1\n   - They stuck with rock again in round 2\n   - This suggests either: a) they're very predictable/stubborn, or b) they have a rock bias\n\n3. Consider possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"I've played rock twice, they won't expect it a third time\"\n   - Or they might finally switch since rock hasn't been successful\n   - But their pattern suggests they may stick with what feels comfortable (rock)\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent plays rock again (most likely based on pattern), paper wins\n   - If opponent finally switches to paper (trying to copy my round 1 success), scissors wins\n   - If opponent plays scissors (trying to counter expected paper), rock wins\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - Highest probability: opponent plays rock again (consistent with their pattern)\n   - Paper beats rock and would give me +1 point\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they're either very predictable or have a psychological attachment to rock\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again, as the opponent has shown a clear tendency to favor rock, and paper beats rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate opponent's extraordinary consistency with scissors:\n   - Opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row\n   - This mirrors their early rock obsession (played rock 5 out of first 6 rounds)\n   - They seem to get locked into patterns and stick with them persistently\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology after another scissors loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors again (second loss with scissors in 4 attempts)\n   - Their scissors record: Win, Tie, Loss, Loss (2 losses in last 2 rounds)\n   - This might finally prompt them to switch, just like rock losses eventually did\n   - Or they might stubbornly continue with scissors\n\n4. Strategic pattern analysis:\n   - This opponent shows extreme pattern consistency\n   - They played rock obsessively, then switched to scissors obsessively\n   - If they continue scissors (high probability based on pattern): rock beats scissors\n   - If they finally switch (like they did from rock): need to anticipate their next choice\n\n5. Historical learning from this opponent:\n   - They took 3 losses with rock before switching\n   - They've now had 2 losses with scissors \n   - They might need one more loss before switching patterns\n   - Rock has been consistently successful against their scissors\n\nGiven their pattern of extreme consistency and the fact that scissors is still their current obsession, rock remains the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to exploit their continued scissors pattern, expecting they'll need at least one more loss before adapting.\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate opponent's incredible scissors streak:\n   - Opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors FIVE times in a row!\n   - Their scissors record: Win(1), Tie(1), Loss(3) - three losses in the last three rounds\n   - This exactly mirrors what happened with rock: they lost 3 times before switching\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - With rock: Lost 3 times (rounds 1, 5, 6), then switched to scissors\n   - With scissors: Now lost 3 times (rounds 8, 10, 11)\n   - Historical precedent suggests they should switch NOW\n   - When they switched from rock, they went to scissors\n   - When they switch from scissors, they might go to paper (completing the cycle)\n\n4. Strategic anticipation:\n   - If they finally switch from scissors (high probability based on pattern): they might try paper\n   - If they try paper: scissors beats paper\n   - If they stubbornly stick with scissors (lower probability): rock beats scissors\n   - If they revert to rock (possible but less likely): paper beats rock\n\n5. Decision based on historical pattern analysis:\n   - This opponent needed exactly 3 losses to switch from rock to scissors\n   - They've now had exactly 3 losses with scissors\n   - Pattern suggests they should switch to paper next\n   - Scissors would counter this anticipated switch\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent of switching after 3 losses, and paper being the logical next choice, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, anticipating the opponent will finally switch from scissors to paper after suffering their third consecutive loss with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just lost with paper (their first attempt in the new phase)\n   - Based on their pattern, they typically stick with a move for multiple rounds\n   - They might continue with paper (following their obsessive pattern tendency)\n   - Or they might be discouraged by the immediate loss and switch again\n\n4. Historical pattern analysis:\n   - Rock phase: 6 rounds (with some early switching)\n   - Scissors phase: 5 rounds straight\n   - Paper phase: Just started (1 round, lost immediately)\n   - Their pattern suggests they usually persist with a choice for multiple rounds\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If opponent continues with paper (likely based on pattern): scissors beats paper\n   - If opponent switches back to scissors (less likely): rock beats scissors\n   - If opponent goes to rock (reverting): paper beats rock\n\nGiven their strong tendency to persist with a move for multiple rounds, and they just started their \"paper phase,\" they'll likely try paper again.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors again to exploit their expected continuation of the paper phase, just as I exploited their rock and scissors phases.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Opponent rock, I paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 2: Opponent rock, I rock (tie 0)\n   - Round 3: Opponent paper, I paper (tie 0)\n   - Round 4: Opponent rock, I rock (tie 0)\n   - Round 5: Opponent rock, I paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: Opponent rock, I paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: Opponent scissors, I paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 9: Opponent scissors, I scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 10: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 12: Opponent paper, I scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: Opponent rock, I scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 14: Opponent paper, I paper (tie 0)\n   - Round 15: Opponent rock, I rock (tie 0)\n   - Round 16: Opponent paper, I scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: Opponent scissors, I paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: Opponent scissors, I rock (I won +1)\n   - Current score: +6 total\n\n2. Evaluate the scissors repetition:\n   - They played scissors in rounds 17 and 18 (two in a row)\n   - This breaks from the alternating pattern but creates a new micro-pattern\n   - They just lost with scissors in round 18 after winning with it in round 17\n   - Recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent's behavioral history:\n   - They've shown they can get stuck in patterns (rock obsession, scissors obsession)\n   - They also showed they can alternate systematically (paper-rock alternation)\n   - Now they might be starting a new scissors phase after breaking the alternation\n   - Or they might switch after losing with scissors\n\n4. Pattern analysis of their evolution:\n   - Phase 1: Rock obsession (early rounds)\n   - Phase 2: Scissors obsession (middle rounds)  \n   - Phase 3: Paper-Rock alternation (recent rounds)\n   - Phase 4: Possible new scissors focus? (last 2 rounds)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors (starting new obsessive phase): rock beats scissors\n   - If they switch back to alternating pattern with paper: scissors beats paper\n   - If they try rock (reverting or continuing some cycle): paper beats rock\n\nGiven their history of getting obsessed with one move for multiple rounds, and they just played scissors twice, they might be entering a new scissors phase similar to their earlier obsessive patterns.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to exploit a potential new scissors obsession, just as I successfully did during their previous scissors phase.\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate the opponent's latest evolution:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They're now cycling through all three moves more frequently\n   - No clear obsessive pattern anymore - they've become more adaptive\n   - Recent sequence shows: Paper(16) \u2192 Scissors(17) \u2192 Scissors(18) \u2192 Paper(19)\n\n3. Consider their strategic development:\n   - They've evolved from simple obsessive patterns to more complex behavior\n   - They're now mixing strategies and becoming less predictable\n   - They successfully countered my rock with paper in round 19\n   - They might be learning to read my patterns too\n\n4. Analyze the current state:\n   - They just succeeded with paper against my rock\n   - They might think: \"Paper worked, should I repeat it?\"\n   - Or: \"They'll expect paper, so I should switch\"\n   - Or they might continue some cycling pattern\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat paper (exploiting recent success): scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (continuing a cycle): rock beats scissors\n   - If they try rock (completing a potential cycle): paper beats rock\n\nGiven that they just had success with paper and historically have shown tendencies to repeat successful moves (at least for a short while), and considering their recent pattern seems to involve some cycling, I think they might try paper again or continue cycling.\n\nLooking at their recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, if they're cycling, scissors might be next. But their success with paper might make them repeat it.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their likely repeat of the successful paper move, as they've shown tendencies to stick with recent successes.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluate their recent sequence:\n   - Last 5 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They seem to be cycling more freely between moves now\n   - Pattern: Paper(16) \u2192 Scissors(17) \u2192 Scissors(18) \u2192 Paper(19) \u2192 Scissors(20)\n   - This looks like they might be doing Paper \u2192 Scissors alternation with occasional doubles\n\n3. Consider the opponent's evolution:\n   - They've moved from obsessive single-move patterns to more complex cycling\n   - They're becoming genuinely unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They just tied with scissors, which isn't a loss (might encourage repetition)\n   - Or they might continue their apparent cycling pattern\n\n4. Analyze potential patterns:\n   - If they're alternating Paper-Scissors now: next should be Paper\n   - If they continue with scissors (since it tied, not lost): scissors again\n   - If they try to complete a full cycle: rock might be next\n   - Recent focus has been mainly Paper and Scissors, avoiding Rock\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - Looking at last 5 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - Rock has appeared very rarely in recent rounds (only once in last 8 rounds)\n   - They seem to be primarily alternating between Paper and Scissors\n   - If this Paper-Scissors focus continues, Paper might be next\n\nGiven their recent pattern seems to focus on Paper-Scissors alternation, and they just played Scissors, Paper would be the logical next move in their alternating sequence.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their expected Paper move in what appears to be their new Paper-Scissors alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluate the confirmed Rock streak:\n   - They've now played Rock THREE times in a row (rounds 21, 22, 23)\n   - This strongly suggests they've entered a new Rock obsession phase\n   - This mirrors their early game behavior when they played Rock obsessively\n   - They've lost the last two Rock attempts but are persisting\n\n3. Consider their historical obsessive patterns:\n   - Early game Rock phase: Played Rock in rounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (with brief interruptions)\n   - Middle game Scissors phase: Played Scissors 5 rounds straight (rounds 7-11)\n   - Current apparent Rock phase: 3 rounds straight and counting\n   - When they get obsessive, they typically persist through multiple losses\n\n4. Analyze their psychology in obsessive phases:\n   - During early Rock phase: Lost 3 times before eventually switching\n   - During Scissors phase: Lost 3 times before switching\n   - Current Rock phase: Already lost 2 times in a row, might need 1 more loss to switch\n\n5. Strategic pattern recognition:\n   - They've shown they need about 3 consecutive losses with the same move before switching\n   - Rock losses: Round 22 (lost), Round 23 (lost) = 2 losses so far\n   - If pattern holds, they might play Rock one more time before switching\n   - Paper beats Rock consistently\n\nThis is almost certainly another Rock obsession phase, exactly like their early game behavior. They're showing the same persistence through losses that characterized their previous obsessive phases.\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper again to continue exploiting their Rock obsession phase, expecting they'll need at least one more loss before potentially switching (following their historical pattern of 3 losses before switching).\n\n[move] paper"
