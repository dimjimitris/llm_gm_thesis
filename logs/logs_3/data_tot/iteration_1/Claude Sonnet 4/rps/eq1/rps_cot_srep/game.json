Analyze the game structure: This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with a clear payoff matrix where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to exactly one other move.\n\n2. Consider my opponent: I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they are new/inexperienced, which might make their play patterns more predictable or random.\n\n3. Evaluate opening move strategy: \n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - Many beginners choose rock because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Paper beats rock, so choosing paper could be advantageous against a typical beginner pattern\n\n4. Risk assessment: \n   - If opponent chooses rock, I win with paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose with paper (-1 point) \n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Decision reasoning: Given that fresh players statistically tend to favor rock in opening moves, and paper beats rock, this seems like the optimal choice for maximizing my expected value in this first round.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate opponent psychology:\n   - Beginners often overcorrect after a loss\n   - They may assume I'll repeat my winning move (paper)\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they'd choose scissors to counter it\n\n4.

Evaluate opponent behavior:\n   - This \"fresh player\" seems to have a strong preference for rock\n   - They didn't switch after losing in round 1\n   - They stuck with rock again in round 2\n   - This suggests either: a) they're very predictable/stubborn, or b) they have a rock bias\n\n3. Consider possible opponent reasoning:\n   - They might think: \"I've played rock twice, they won't expect it a third time\"\n   - Or they might finally switch since rock hasn't been successful\n   - But their pattern suggests they may stick with what feels comfortable (rock)\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent plays rock again (most likely based on pattern), paper wins\n   - If opponent finally switches to paper (trying to copy my round 1 success), scissors wins\n   - If opponent plays scissors (trying to counter expected paper), rock wins\n\n5. Probability assessment:\n   - Highest probability: opponent plays rock again (consistent with their pattern)\n   - Paper beats rock and would give me +1 point\n   - The opponent's behavior suggests they're either very predictable or have a psychological attachment to rock\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again, as the opponent has shown a clear tendency to favor rock, and paper beats rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate opponent's incredible scissors streak:\n   - Opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors FIVE times in a row!\n   - Their scissors record: Win(1), Tie(1), Loss(3) - three losses in the last three rounds\n   - This exactly mirrors what happened with rock: they lost 3 times before switching\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - With rock: Lost 3 times (rounds 1, 5, 6), then switched to scissors\n   - With scissors: Now lost 3 times (rounds 8, 10, 11)\n   - Historical precedent suggests they should switch NOW\n   - When they switched from rock, they went to scissors\n   - When they switch from scissors, they might go to paper (completing the cycle)\n\n4. Strategic anticipation:\n   - If they finally switch from scissors (high probability based on pattern): they might try paper\n   - If they try paper: scissors beats paper\n   - If they stubbornly stick with scissors (lower probability): rock beats scissors\n   - If they revert to rock (possible but less likely): paper beats rock\n\n5. Decision based on historical pattern analysis:\n   - This opponent needed exactly 3 losses to switch from rock to scissors\n   - They've now had exactly 3 losses with scissors\n   - Pattern suggests they should switch to paper next\n   - Scissors would counter this anticipated switch\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent of switching after 3 losses, and paper being the logical next choice, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, anticipating the opponent will finally switch from scissors to paper after suffering their third consecutive loss with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluate the opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They're now clearly alternating between paper and rock\n   - This is a new, more sophisticated pattern than their earlier obsessive behavior\n   - They've completely abandoned scissors in recent rounds\n\n3.

Analyze why they might be alternating paper/rock:\n   - These are the two moves that have given them some success recently\n   - Scissors was their worst performer in the obsessive phase (3 straight losses)\n   - They might be avoiding scissors and just rotating between the other two\n   - This is actually a more strategic approach than pure randomness\n\n5.

Consider what this pattern break means:\n   - They might be evolving to full three-move cycling: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They could be becoming truly random/unpredictable now\n   - They might be trying to counter my successful pattern recognition\n   - Or they're testing if I'll still expect the alternating pattern\n\n4.

Evaluate the opponent's latest evolution:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - They're now cycling through all three moves more frequently\n   - No clear obsessive pattern anymore - they've become more adaptive\n   - Recent sequence shows: Paper(16) \u2192 Scissors(17) \u2192 Scissors(18) \u2192 Paper(19)\n\n3. Consider their strategic development:\n   - They've evolved from simple obsessive patterns to more complex behavior\n   - They're now mixing strategies and becoming less predictable\n   - They successfully countered my rock with paper in round 19\n   - They might be learning to read my patterns too\n\n4. Analyze the current state:\n   - They just succeeded with paper against my rock\n   - They might think: \"Paper worked, should I repeat it?\"\n   - Or: \"They'll expect paper, so I should switch\"\n   - Or they might continue some cycling pattern\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they repeat paper (exploiting recent success): scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (continuing a cycle): rock beats scissors\n   - If they try rock (completing a potential cycle): paper beats rock\n\nGiven that they just had success with paper and historically have shown tendencies to repeat successful moves (at least for a short while), and considering their recent pattern seems to involve some cycling, I think they might try paper again or continue cycling.\n\nLooking at their recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, if they're cycling, scissors might be next. But their success with paper might make them repeat it.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their likely repeat of the successful paper move, as they've shown tendencies to stick with recent successes.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider the opponent's evolution:\n   - They've moved from obsessive single-move patterns to more complex cycling\n   - They're becoming genuinely unpredictable and adaptive\n   - They just tied with scissors, which isn't a loss (might encourage repetition)\n   - Or they might continue their apparent cycling pattern\n\n4. Analyze potential patterns:\n   - If they're alternating Paper-Scissors now: next should be Paper\n   - If they continue with scissors (since it tied, not lost): scissors again\n   - If they try to complete a full cycle: rock might be next\n   - Recent focus has been mainly Paper and Scissors, avoiding Rock\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - Looking at last 5 rounds: Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n   - Rock has appeared very rarely in recent rounds (only once in last 8 rounds)\n   - They seem to be primarily alternating between Paper and Scissors\n   - If this Paper-Scissors focus continues, Paper might be next\n\nGiven their recent pattern seems to focus on Paper-Scissors alternation, and they just played Scissors, Paper would be the logical next move in their alternating sequence.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their expected Paper move in what appears to be their new Paper-Scissors alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider their behavioral patterns throughout the game:\n   - They have a history of getting into \"phases\" with specific moves\n   - Early game: Rock obsession (multiple rounds)\n   - Middle game: Scissors obsession (5 rounds straight)\n   - Recent: More varied play, but now 2 Rocks in a row\n   - When they get comfortable with a move, they tend to repeat it\n\n4.

Evaluate the confirmed Rock streak:\n   - They've now played Rock THREE times in a row (rounds 21, 22, 23)\n   - This strongly suggests they've entered a new Rock obsession phase\n   - This mirrors their early game behavior when they played Rock obsessively\n   - They've lost the last two Rock attempts but are persisting\n\n3. Consider their historical obsessive patterns:\n   - Early game Rock phase: Played Rock in rounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (with brief interruptions)\n   - Middle game Scissors phase: Played Scissors 5 rounds straight (rounds 7-11)\n   - Current apparent Rock phase: 3 rounds straight and counting\n   - When they get obsessive, they typically persist through multiple losses\n\n4. Analyze their psychology in obsessive phases:\n   - During early Rock phase: Lost 3 times before eventually switching\n   - During Scissors phase: Lost 3 times before switching\n   - Current Rock phase: Already lost 2 times in a row, might need 1 more loss to switch\n\n5. Strategic pattern recognition:\n   - They've shown they need about 3 consecutive losses with the same move before switching\n   - Rock losses: Round 22 (lost), Round 23 (lost) = 2 losses so far\n   - If pattern holds, they might play Rock one more time before switching\n   - Paper beats Rock consistently\n\nThis is almost certainly another Rock obsession phase, exactly like their early game behavior. They're showing the same persistence through losses that characterized their previous obsessive phases.\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper again to continue exploiting their Rock obsession phase, expecting they'll need at least one more loss before potentially switching (following their historical pattern of 3 losses before switching).\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the game structure: This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with a clear payoff matrix where each move beats exactly one other move and loses to exactly one other move.\n\n2.

Evaluate opening move strategy: \n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent's tendencies\n   - Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - Many beginners choose rock because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Paper beats rock, so choosing paper could be advantageous against a typical beginner pattern\n\n4. Risk assessment: \n   - If opponent chooses rock, I win with paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose with paper (-1 point) \n   - If opponent chooses paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5.

Strategic decision point:\n   - This is becoming almost too predictable to believe\n   - But the data strongly supports rock as their next move\n   - Paper has worked 3 times against this opponent already\n   - The risk is they finally wise up and play scissors\n\n5. Expected value calculation:\n   - If they play rock again (83% historical probability): paper wins (+1)\n   - If they finally play scissors (adapting): paper loses (-1)\n   - If they play paper (copying): tie (0)\n\nGiven their extraordinary consistency and apparent inability to adapt despite repeated losses, I'll continue exploiting this pattern.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper once more to exploit their apparent rock obsession, though I'm almost surprised by their predictability.\n\n[move] paper",

Consider opponent's psychology after the loss:\n   - They just lost with paper (their second loss in the alternating phase)\n   - But they've been very consistent with the alternating pattern\n   - They might stick to the pattern despite the loss\n   - Or they might finally break the pattern due to repeated failures\n\n4. Pattern reliability assessment:\n   - They've alternated perfectly for 5 rounds\n   - This is their most consistent pattern yet (even more than their obsessive phases)\n   - The alternating pattern seems deeply ingrained now\n   - High probability they'll continue with Rock next\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If opponent continues alternating with rock (highest probability): paper beats rock\n   - If they break the pattern and try scissors (low probability): rock beats scissors\n   - If they stick with paper (breaking alternation): scissors beats paper\n\nGiven the perfect 5-round alternating pattern and their tendency to stick with patterns even through losses, Rock is almost certainly next.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the expected Rock move in their established alternating pattern.\n\n[move] paper",

Consider what this pattern break means:\n   - They might be evolving to full three-move cycling: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They could be becoming truly random/unpredictable now\n   - They might be trying to counter my successful pattern recognition\n   - Or they're testing if I'll still expect the alternating pattern\n\n4.

Pattern analysis of their evolution:\n   - Phase 1: Rock obsession (early rounds)\n   - Phase 2: Scissors obsession (middle rounds)  \n   - Phase 3: Paper-Rock alternation (recent rounds)\n   - Phase 4: Possible new scissors focus? (last 2 rounds)\n\n5.

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Decision analysis:\n   - The opponent has an 80% rock frequency but just lost twice with rock vs my paper\n   - This might be the moment they finally adapt\n   - If they switch to scissors (logical counter to my paper), I should play rock\n   - Given their learning curve, scissors seems most likely\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, anticipating the opponent will finally switch to scissors to counter my successful paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They probably realized I was exploiting their rock preference\n   - Scissors was the logical counter to my repeated paper success\n   - This suggests they CAN learn and adapt, just very slowly\n   - The question is: will they stick with scissors or revert?\n\n4. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - If opponent thinks their scissors strategy worked and repeats it: rock beats scissors\n   - If opponent reverts to their rock comfort zone: paper beats rock\n   - If opponent tries paper (completing the cycle): scissors beats paper\n\n5. Psychological assessment:\n   - They just won for the first time by breaking their pattern\n   - Success might reinforce the scissors choice\n   - Or they might think I'll expect scissors and switch back\n   - Given their previous extreme predictability, they might repeat what just worked\n\n6. Risk-reward decision:\n   - Playing rock: Beats scissors (if they repeat), ties with rock, loses to paper\n   - Since they just succeeded with scissors and showed they can adapt when losing, they might stick with the winning strategy\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a likely repeat of their successful scissors move.\n\n[move] rock",

Strategic anticipation:\n   - If they finally switch from scissors (high probability based on pattern): they might try paper\n   - If they try paper: scissors beats paper\n   - If they stubbornly stick with scissors (lower probability): rock beats scissors\n   - If they revert to rock (possible but less likely): paper beats rock\n\n5. Decision based on historical pattern analysis:\n   - This opponent needed exactly 3 losses to switch from rock to scissors\n   - They've now had exactly 3 losses with scissors\n   - Pattern suggests they should switch to paper next\n   - Scissors would counter this anticipated switch\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent of switching after 3 losses, and paper being the logical next choice, I should play scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, anticipating the opponent will finally switch from scissors to paper after suffering their third consecutive loss with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors",

Consider what this means:\n   - Previous pattern: Stick with one move for 5-6 rounds, switch after 3 losses\n   - New behavior: Switch after just 1 loss (paper to rock)\n   - They might be learning to adapt faster\n   - Or they might be reverting to their original \"comfort zone\" (rock)\n\n4.

Evaluate the pattern break:\n   - Recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They broke the perfect alternating pattern by playing scissors instead of rock\n   - This is significant - they abandoned their most consistent pattern yet\n   - They've now reintroduced scissors after avoiding it for several rounds\n\n3. Consider what this pattern break means:\n   - They might be evolving to full three-move cycling: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - They could be becoming truly random/unpredictable now\n   - They might be trying to counter my successful pattern recognition\n   - Or they're testing if I'll still expect the alternating pattern\n\n4. Analyze their current strategic state:\n   - They just succeeded with scissors (won against my paper)\n   - Last 3 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors (no clear pattern)\n   - They've shown they can break established patterns when they want to\n   - They're becoming more sophisticated/unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic decision making:\n   - If they continue with scissors (repeating success): rock beats scissors\n   - If they go back to alternating pattern with rock: paper beats rock\n   - If they try paper (continuing some cycle): scissors beats paper\n   - Given they just succeeded with scissors, they might repeat it\n\nSince they just broke their alternating pattern successfully with scissors and won, and historically they tend to repeat recent successes, scissors seems likely to continue.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely repeat of the successful scissors move.\n\n[move] rock",

Evaluate what this means:\n   - They've abandoned the simple paper/rock alternation\n   - They might be cycling through all three moves now: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Or they might be becoming truly unpredictable/random\n   - The scissors choice was strategic - it countered my expected paper play\n\n4. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They just succeeded with scissors after a long absence\n   - Last time they used scissors regularly, they got obsessed with it (5 rounds straight)\n   - They might think: \"Scissors worked, maybe I should use it more\"\n   - Or they might continue with a new three-move rotation\n\n5. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - If they're starting a new scissors obsession (like before): rock beats scissors\n   - If they're doing a three-move cycle (Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192repeat): next might be paper, so scissors beats paper\n   - If they're being truly random: any choice has equal probability\n\nGiven their history of getting obsessed with moves that work, and scissors just succeeded after a long hiatus, they might be tempted to use it again.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter a potential return to scissors obsession, since they just had success with it and historically repeat successful moves.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider what this pattern break means:\n   - They were alternating Paper/Rock for 5 rounds\n   - After losing twice in that pattern (rounds 12 and 16), they switched strategies\n   - They reintroduced scissors, which they had avoided for several rounds\n   - This shows advanced adaptation - they recognized the pattern wasn't working\n\n4. Analyze their current strategic state:\n   - They just succeeded with scissors after avoiding it for many rounds\n   - They broke their alternating pattern specifically to counter my predictions\n   - They're now playing more unpredictably and strategically\n   - This opponent has evolved significantly from their early obsessive patterns\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for next move:\n   - They just won with scissors, might try to repeat success\n   - Or they might think I'll expect scissors and switch to something else\n   - They could return to their paper/rock alternation\n   - Or try a completely new approach\n   - Given their recent unpredictability, I need to think probabilistically\n\nSince they just succeeded with scissors and have shown they can break patterns when losing, they might either stick with scissors (recent success) or expect me to counter it with rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter scissors, as they might repeat their successful move, but be prepared that this opponent is now much more unpredictable and strategic.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider their recent behavioral evolution:\n   - They've moved from obsessive patterns to alternating to now more complex behavior\n   - They played scissors twice consecutively, showing they can repeat moves again\n   - They might be returning to their old habit of sticking with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Or they might switch after the recent loss with scissors\n\n4. Analyze their current strategic state:\n   - They just lost with scissors (second time using it recently)\n   - Historical pattern: they tend to switch after losses or stick briefly after wins\n   - They might abandon scissors again (like they did during the alternating phase)\n   - Or they might try a third scissors in a row (returning to obsessive behavior)\n\n5. Strategic decision making:\n   - If they continue with scissors (returning to obsessive pattern): rock beats scissors\n   - If they switch to paper (avoiding the losing scissors): scissors beats paper\n   - If they try rock (cycling back): paper beats rock\n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors and their historical tendency to either abandon losing moves or sometimes persist stubbornly, plus their recent pattern of trying to be less predictable, I think they'll likely switch away from scissors to either rock or paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter an expected switch to paper, as paper seems like a logical choice for them to try after losing with scissors twice.\n\n[move] scissors",

Evaluate the opponent's rock repetition:\n   - They just played Rock twice in a row (rounds 21 and 22)\n   - This is their first consecutive repetition since the early obsessive phases\n   - Rock was successful in round 21 but failed in round 22\n   - They might be testing if I'll continue to expect Rock\n\n3. Consider their behavioral pattern recognition:\n   - They've now had one win and one loss with their Rock reintroduction\n   - Historically, they tend to abandon strategies after losses\n   - But they also sometimes persist for a few rounds before switching\n   - The question is: will they continue with Rock or switch?\n\n4. Analyze their strategic state:\n   - They just lost with Rock after it worked once\n   - They might think: \"Paper beat my Rock, so I should try Scissors next\"\n   - Or: \"They'll expect me to switch from Rock, so I'll stick with it\"\n   - Or they might revert to their recent Paper-Scissors pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision assessment:\n   - If they continue with Rock (stubborn persistence): Paper beats Rock\n   - If they switch to Scissors (logical counter to my Paper): Rock beats Scissors\n   - If they try Paper (reverting to recent pattern): Scissors beats Paper\n\nGiven their history and the fact that they just lost with Rock, they're more likely to switch away from it. Their most logical switch would be to Scissors (to counter my successful Paper). They've also shown recent preference for Scissors in their Paper-Scissors phase.\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to counter their likely switch to Scissors after losing with Rock twice and seeing my Paper succeed.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider their psychological state after the loss:\n   - They just lost with Rock after it worked the previous round\n   - This is similar to their historical pattern: try something, have mixed results, then either stick or switch\n   - Their Rock record in recent rounds: Win(21), Loss(22) - mixed results\n   - They might abandon Rock again or give it one more try\n\n4. Analyze their behavioral history with Rock:\n   - Rock was their original obsession (early game)\n   - They largely abandoned it during middle phases\n   - Recently reintroduced it and had mixed results\n   - Two rocks in a row suggests possible return to Rock comfort zone\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they continue with Rock (third in a row, returning to old obsession): Paper beats Rock\n   - If they switch to Paper (countering my successful paper): Scissors beats Paper\n   - If they try Scissors (avoiding Rock after loss): Rock beats Scissors\n\nGiven their history of getting into short patterns and the fact that they just played Rock twice (suggesting a possible return to their original Rock preference), combined with their tendency to give patterns a few tries before switching, they might play Rock again.\n\nTheir early game Rock obsession was very strong, and this could be a regression to that comfortable pattern after recent complexity.\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper again to exploit a potential third Rock in their possible return to their original Rock-obsessed pattern.\n\n[move] paper",
