Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is a common default choice\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and opponent -1 points\n   - This maximizes my advantage\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, it's a tie\n   - The potential reward (+1) outweighs the risk given my reasoning about fresh players\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
