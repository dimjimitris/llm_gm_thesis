    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The pattern broke - I expected my opponent to play paper, but they played scissors instead, resulting in a tie.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n- Round 16: rock (opponent won)\n- Round 17: paper (tie)\n- Round 18: rock (I won)\n- Round 19: scissors (tie)\n\nIt seems like my opponent may have noticed I was predicting their rock-paper alternating pattern and switched to scissors to disrupt it. This is consistent with their behavior throughout the game - they adapt when I start successfully predicting them.\n\nSince they just played scissors and have shown they change strategies when patterns become predictable, I need to think about what they might do next. They could:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Return to their rock-paper pattern\n3. Try something completely different\n\nGiven their adaptive nature, I'll go with rock to beat scissors if they repeat it.\n\n[move] rock"
