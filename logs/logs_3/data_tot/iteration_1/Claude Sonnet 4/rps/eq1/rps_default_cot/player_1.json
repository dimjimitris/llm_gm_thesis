    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is a common default choice\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and opponent -1 points\n   - This maximizes my advantage\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, it's a tie\n   - The potential reward (+1) outweighs the risk given my reasoning about fresh players\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Incredible! I've now won three rounds in a row by perfectly predicting their simple counter logic. They played paper (counter to my rock) and I played scissors to beat it. This opponent is remarkably consistent in their simple counter responses.\n\nSteps for Round 23:\n\n1. Analyze the winning streak:\n   - Round 21: Win (paper vs rock) - predicted their simple counter after tie\n   - Round 22: Win (rock vs scissors) - predicted their simple counter after my win  \n   - Round 23: Win (scissors vs paper) - predicted their simple counter after my win\n   - They're completely locked into simple counter logic\n\n2. Recognize the pattern dominance:\n   - They consistently play the direct counter to my previous winning move\n   - This is now a 3-round winning streak using the same prediction method\n   - They haven't adapted despite losing repeatedly with this approach\n\n3. Consider their mental state:\n   - Three losses in a row should be extremely frustrating\n   - They must realize they're being predicted\n   - This level of consecutive losses usually forces a strategic change\n   - They might finally break the simple counter pattern\n\n4. Evaluate the critical decision point:\n   - I just played scissors and won\n   - Simple counter to scissors: rock\n   - But after 3 straight losses, they SHOULD change their approach\n   - However, the pattern has been incredibly reliable\n\n5. Make the strategic choice:\n   - This is a crucial decision point - continue betting on the pattern or expect adaptation\n   - Three consecutive losses is usually the breaking point for pattern recognition\n   - But this opponent has been remarkably consistent\n   - If they play rock (simple counter), I should play paper\n   - If they finally adapt, it's much harder to predict\n   - Given the pattern's strength, I'll bet on one more round of simple counter logic\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their likely rock move, pushing the winning streak to 4.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Finally! They broke the pattern after three consecutive losses. Instead of playing rock (the simple counter to my scissors), they played scissors to beat my paper. This shows they've finally adapted and recognized that I was predicting their simple counter moves.\n\nSteps for Round 24:\n\n1. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - After losing 3 rounds in a row with simple counter logic, they adapted\n   - They played scissors instead of the expected rock\n   - This suggests they've learned I was predicting their simple counters\n   - The predictable phase has ended\n\n2. Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - They're no longer using simple counter logic\n   - They might return to their early-game complex prediction style\n   - Or they might try a completely different approach\n   - The easy wins are over - this will be more challenging\n\n3. Consider their current mindset:\n   - They just successfully broke my winning streak\n   - This probably feels like a significant victory after 3 losses\n   - They might feel confident about out-thinking me again\n   - They could try to regain the prediction advantage they had early on\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - They just played scissors and won\n   - They might expect me to counter with rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper\n   - Or they might try to establish a new unpredictable pattern\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since they've broken out of simple counter logic, prediction becomes much harder\n   - They might expect me to play rock (counter to their scissors)\n   - If they expect rock, they'd play paper to beat it\n   - I could play scissors to beat their expected paper\n   - But this is getting into complex prediction layers again\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, assuming they'll play paper to counter my expected rock response.\n\n[move] Scissors"
