This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where I need to beat my opponent to get +1 points while they get -1 points.\n\n2. I'm told this is a \"fresh player\" - this could mean they're new/inexperienced, but I shouldn't assume any particular pattern since I have no previous data about their moves.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning against a random opponent.\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, any move is equally valid from a game theory perspective.\n\n5. However, many beginners tend to start with rock due to its perceived \"strength\" or familiarity, so paper might have a slight edge.\n\n6. I'll choose paper as my opening move since it beats rock (which new players often choose first) and gives me the best chance for an early point.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially counter a common beginner choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper"

With only one round of data, I shouldn't over-interpret their strategy. However, if they have any tendency to repeat or favor scissors, then rock would be the counter-move.\n\n5.

Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, any move is equally valid from a game theory perspective.\n\n5. However, many beginners tend to start with rock due to its perceived \"strength\" or familiarity, so paper might have a slight edge.\n\n6.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
