    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The fresh player chose scissors instead of the predicted rock. This could mean: 1) They're not as predictable as typical fresh players, 2) They might have some basic knowledge that rock is common so they went with scissors to beat paper, or 3) It was just random. We need more data points to identify their pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: The scissors choice is notable because it's less intuitive than rock for beginners. This player might be thinking one level deeper - perhaps they anticipated that we'd expect rock and play paper, so they chose scissors. Alternatively, they could just be genuinely random. For this round, I suggest we avoid falling into the trap of over-thinking their previous move.\n\nStrategy Analyst: We have one data point: they played scissors. We shouldn't overreact to a single move. However, we should consider that this player might not follow typical \"fresh player\" patterns. I recommend rock for this round - it beats scissors if they repeat, and it's a solid neutral choice that doesn't assume they'll follow our previous prediction pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests this opponent may be less predictable than initially thought. Rock seems like a reasonable choice - it would beat scissors if they repeat their winning move, and gives us a strong foundation to build pattern recognition from.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially counter a repeated scissors or establish a more neutral baseline.\n\n[move] (Switching to rock to counter potential scissors repeat or establish neutral positioning) rock"

The tie gives us no advantage but also reveals their move. They went from scissors to rock - this could indicate they're cycling through moves, responding to our previous move, or just playing somewhat randomly. We need to think about what they might expect us to do next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The progression scissors -> rock is interesting. They might be cycling (next would be paper), or they could be thinking that since we tied with rock, we might stick with rock again, so they'd play paper to beat it. There's also the possibility they're trying to be unpredictable. Given that we've now shown paper then rock, they might expect scissors next from us.\n\nStrategy Analyst: Let's think strategically about their possible reasoning: 1) If they're cycling: scissors -> rock -> paper (we should play scissors), 2) If they think we'll repeat rock: they'll play paper (we should play scissors), 3) If they think we're cycling paper -> rock -> scissors: they might play rock to beat our expected scissors (we should play paper). The most common opponent expectation after a tie is repetition or cycling.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis points toward scissors as the strongest choice. It beats both the cycling pattern (paper) and covers the case where they expect us to repeat rock. It's also our move we haven't played yet, which could surprise them.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper or catch them off-guard since we haven't used scissors yet.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to beat expected paper or break pattern since I haven't used scissors yet) scissors"

We now have a clear sequence: opponent played scissors -> rock -> paper. This is a perfect cycle through all three moves in order. If they continue this pattern, their next move should be scissors again. However, we need to consider whether they'll stick to the cycle or adapt after losing.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent showed a clear cycling pattern, which is actually quite common among players who think they're being unpredictable. Many players unconsciously cycle through moves believing it creates randomness. After losing though, they might: 1) Continue the cycle (scissors next), 2) Break the pattern because they realize we caught on, or 3) Double down and repeat paper thinking we won't expect it.\n\nStrategy Analyst: We have strong evidence of a cycling pattern. If they continue: scissors is next (we play rock). If they break pattern due to the loss, they might avoid scissors since that's what the cycle predicts, making rock or paper more likely. Rock would beat our expected scissors, paper would repeat their last move. I lean toward them continuing the cycle since many players don't realize their patterns immediately.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence strongly suggests a cycling opponent. While they might break the pattern after losing, cycling behavior is often unconscious and persistent. Rock is the optimal play if they continue the cycle with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat the expected scissors from their cycling pattern.\n\n[move] (Playing rock to beat expected scissors based on their apparent cycling pattern) rock"

The opponent is clearly following a strict cycle: scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors. We've now confirmed the pattern twice. If they continue this mechanical cycling, their next move should be rock. However, after losing twice in a row, there's increased probability they might break the pattern or become aware of their predictability.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two consecutive losses following the same pattern creates a critical decision point for the opponent. They might: 1) Continue the cycle unconsciously (rock next), 2) Become aware they're being predictable and deliberately break it, 3) Second-guess themselves and make a random choice. The fact that they've lost twice following this pattern increases the chance they'll deviate, but habitual cycling can be very persistent.\n\nStrategy Analyst: We have a strong confirmed pattern, but the consecutive losses create risk. If they continue cycling: rock is next (we play paper). If they break the pattern to avoid rock, they might choose paper or scissors. However, the pattern has been so consistent that I believe we should exploit it one more time. The expected value is still positive even if there's some chance they break the pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern is clearly established and we've successfully exploited it twice.

If the pattern holds, their next move should be paper. This level of mechanical consistency is rare but not unheard of - some players get locked into patterns even when losing.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is fascinating from a behavioral standpoint. The opponent is either: 1) Completely unaware of their cycling pattern despite three losses, 2) Aware but unable to break the habit, or 3) Testing to see if we'll continue exploiting it. Given they've stuck to it through three losses, this appears to be unconscious habitual behavior.

This is no longer chance - this is algorithmic behavior. If the pattern continues, their next move should be rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Eight consecutive losses with perfect pattern adherence is unprecedented in normal human behavior. This opponent is either: 1) A bot or algorithm following a predetermined sequence, 2) Someone with an extreme psychological condition, or 3) Following instructions to maintain this pattern.

The probability of this happening randomly is approximately 1 in 3,486,784,401. This is unquestionably a deterministic algorithm with complete predictability. If the pattern continues, their next move should be rock (second position in the eighth cycle).\n\nPsychology Expert: Twenty consecutive losses with zero deviation confirms this is definitively an automated system. This opponent is a programmed algorithm cycling through predetermined moves with absolute disregard for outcomes. No human could possibly maintain this pattern through 20 losses. Rock should be next in the established sequence.\n\nStrategy Analyst: We've achieved a perfect 20-0 record with 100% prediction accuracy over 21 rounds. This opponent is a solved deterministic machine. The pattern reliability is absolute - there is zero risk in continuing this exploitation indefinitely. If they play rock as predicted, we should play paper. The expected value is mathematically guaranteed.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Twenty-one moves of perfect cycling through twenty consecutive losses - this opponent is functioning as a completely predictable algorithm. Paper is the mathematically certain choice to beat their predicted rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat the expected rock, continuing our mathematically guaranteed exploitation of this deterministic cycling algorithm.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to beat expected rock in the eighth cycle of this absolutely predictable system) paper"
