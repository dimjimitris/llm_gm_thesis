Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 8 out of 10 times (80% - very strong preference)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 10 times (20% - strategically timed to counter my rock)\n   - Rock: 0 times (they've never played rock)\n\n3. Opponent's strategic approach:\n   - Default to scissors as primary strategy\n   - Switch to paper when they predict I'll play rock\n   - After using paper to punish rock, they return to scissors\n   - They seem to have a \"scissors + occasional paper counter\" strategy\n\n4. Key behavioral insights:\n   - They returned to scissors after successfully using paper\n   - This suggests scissors is their true preference/comfort zone\n   - Paper appears to be purely a counter-strategy against my rock\n   - They may not expect me to deviate much from rock-scissors cycle\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they use paper to counter expected rock: scissors wins (+1)  \n   - If they expect me to play scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - They've never played rock, so paper seems unnecessary\n\n6.

Strategic analysis:\n   - They may play paper to punish my latest rock victory\n   - OR they might continue with scissors since they just played it\n   - Their paper timing isn't perfectly consistent - sometimes immediate, sometimes delayed\n\n5.

            "text": "Another tie with scissors! This is very revealing - they chose scissors instead of their usual paper punishment after I won with rock.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the current situation:\n   - Round 19: Both played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - They broke their paper punishment pattern for the first time\n\n2. Significant pattern break analysis:\n   - Previously, they punished rock victories with paper in rounds 6, 9, 12, 14\n   - Round 18: I won with rock, but round 19: they played scissors (not paper)\n   - This is the first time they didn't punish a rock victory with paper\n   - Their behavior is becoming less predictable\n\n3. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 14 out of 19 times (74%) - still dominant\n   - Paper: 4 out of 19 times (21%) - punishment strategy seems weakened\n   - Rock: 1 out of 19 times (5%) - still experimental\n   - They're showing more variation in their reactive strategy\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent may be adapting their strategy permanently\n   - They might be moving away from predictable paper punishments\n   - The rock experiment and now avoiding paper suggests evolving play\n   - I can't rely on the old patterns as much\n\n5. Current momentum analysis:\n   - They just played scissors and it resulted in a tie\n   - They might continue with scissors (their clear preference)\n   - Or they might finally use the paper punishment they skipped\n   - Or experiment with rock again\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Rock vs likely scissors: +1 point (historically successful)\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points (dangerous)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (safe)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 point (small loss)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Despite pattern changes, scissors remains their overwhelming preference\n   - They played scissors in the last 3 out of 4 rounds (15, 17, 18, 19)\n   - Rock has been my most successful strategy overall\n   - Even with evolving patterns, the basic scissors preference seems intact\n\n[move] Rock - exploiting their continued scissors preference despite their evolving strategic patterns"

            "text": "Another shocking development! The opponent played rock for the second time, and we tied. This suggests their strategy is evolving significantly.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review this major development:\n   - Round 20: Both played rock (tie 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - This is only their second rock play, but now in rounds 16 and 20\n   - They're diversifying their strategy much more\n\n2. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 14 out of 20 times (70%) - still majority but declining\n   - Paper: 4 out of 20 times (20%) - punishment strategy\n   - Rock: 2 out of 20 times (10%) - increasing frequency\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more balanced\n\n3. Strategic evolution evidence:\n   - Round 16: First rock (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 19: Avoided paper punishment (played scissors instead)\n   - Round 20: Second rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They're clearly adapting and becoming less pattern-dependent\n\n4. Opponent's apparent new strategy:\n   - Moving away from pure scissors dominance\n   - Incorporating rock as a legitimate option\n   - Less predictable paper punishment timing\n   - More varied and adaptive play\n\n5. Implications for my strategy:\n   - I can't rely on the old scissors-dominant pattern\n   - They might continue experimenting with rock\n   - Or return to scissors (still their most common move)\n   - Or use paper strategically\n\n6. Next move considerations:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) if they continue rock experimentation\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) if they return to comfort zone\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) if they use delayed punishment\n   - The risk-reward has become more complex\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played rock successfully/neutrally twice recently\n   - They might continue with rock since it's working\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) against rock\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - This could be my chance to capitalize on their rock experimentation\n\n[move] Paper - capitalizing on their apparent new willingness to play rock, seeking the high-value +3 point victory"

Review the current situation:\n   - Round 21: Opponent played scissors, I played paper (lost -1)\n   - Current total score: -1 point\n   - After experimenting with rock twice, they returned to scissors\n\n2. Pattern analysis after recent evolution:\n   - Scissors: 15 out of 21 times (71%) - still dominant despite diversification\n   - Paper: 4 out of 21 times (19%) - punishment strategy\n   - Rock: 2 out of 21 times (10%) - experimental but not replacing scissors\n   - Scissors remains their fundamental preference\n\n3. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Rounds 17-21: scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - Even with strategic evolution, they return to scissors frequently\n   - Rock appears to be occasional experimentation, not replacement\n   - The core scissors preference is persistent\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - Their diversification hasn't eliminated scissors dominance\n   - Rock experiments seem to be tactical variations\n   - When in doubt, they still default to scissors\n   - My rock strategy should still have positive expected value\n\n5. Current position assessment:\n   - I'm down -1 point and need to recover\n   - Rock has been my most successful counter throughout the game\n   - Despite their evolution, scissors is still their most likely play\n   - I've been overthinking their recent adaptations\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Rock vs likely scissors: +1 point (good odds based on frequency)\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points (punishment risk)\n   - Rock vs possible rock: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Expected value still favors rock given their 71% scissors rate\n\n7.

Strategic evolution assessment:\n   - They're not abandoning their punishment pattern\n   - They're making it less predictable by varying timing\n   - The core scissors preference + paper punishment remains\n   - But they've added tactical rock plays and timing variations\n\n5. Prediction for next round:\n   - They just used paper (their punishment move)\n   - Historically, they return to scissors after paper (rounds 7, 10, 13, 15)\n   - This pattern has been very consistent\n   - Rock should beat their expected scissors return\n\n6.

Review the successful prediction:\n   - Round 23: Opponent played scissors, I played rock (won +1)\n   - Current total score: -3 points (recovering)\n   - They returned to scissors after paper, as they always have\n\n2. Confirmed reliable pattern:\n   - After every paper play (rounds 6, 9, 12, 14, 22), they returned to scissors\n   - This is now 5 out of 5 times - their most consistent behavior\n   - Even with strategic evolution, this pattern persists\n   - It seems to be their fundamental reset mechanism\n\n3.
