Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If they use paper to counter expected rock: scissors wins (+1)  \n   - If they expect me to play scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - They've never played rock, so paper seems unnecessary\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock vs likely scissors: +1 point\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points\n   - But they just played scissors, might continue the pattern\n   - Their paper plays seem reactive to my rock success, not proactive\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just returned to scissors after their paper counter-attack\n   - This fits their pattern of reverting to scissors\n   - Rock has the best expected value against their scissors-heavy strategy\n   - I need to start recovering from my -4 deficit\n\n[move] Rock - capitalizing on their return to scissors pattern while accepting the calculated risk of another paper counter"

Pattern now 100% confirmed:\n   - After paper attacks, they ALWAYS return to scissors (rounds 7, 10, 13)\n   - After rock victories, they often (but not always) counter with paper\n   - Scissors remains their overwhelming preference: 10 out of 13 times (77%)\n\n3. Critical decision point:\n   - I just won with rock again in round 13\n   - Based on established pattern, they might play paper in round 14 to punish me\n   - Previous paper punishments came in rounds 6, 9, and 12\n   - The gap between punishments: round 6\u21929 (3 rounds), round 9\u219212 (3 rounds)\n   - If pattern holds: round 12\u219215 would be next paper, but I won rock in round 13\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - They may play paper to punish my latest rock victory\n   - OR they might continue with scissors since they just played it\n   - Their paper timing isn't perfectly consistent - sometimes immediate, sometimes delayed\n\n5.

Review this major development:\n   - Round 20: Both played rock (tie 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - This is only their second rock play, but now in rounds 16 and 20\n   - They're diversifying their strategy much more\n\n2. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 14 out of 20 times (70%) - still majority but declining\n   - Paper: 4 out of 20 times (20%) - punishment strategy\n   - Rock: 2 out of 20 times (10%) - increasing frequency\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more balanced\n\n3. Strategic evolution evidence:\n   - Round 16: First rock (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 19: Avoided paper punishment (played scissors instead)\n   - Round 20: Second rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They're clearly adapting and becoming less pattern-dependent\n\n4. Opponent's apparent new strategy:\n   - Moving away from pure scissors dominance\n   - Incorporating rock as a legitimate option\n   - Less predictable paper punishment timing\n   - More varied and adaptive play\n\n5. Implications for my strategy:\n   - I can't rely on the old scissors-dominant pattern\n   - They might continue experimenting with rock\n   - Or return to scissors (still their most common move)\n   - Or use paper strategically\n\n6. Next move considerations:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) if they continue rock experimentation\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) if they return to comfort zone\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) if they use delayed punishment\n   - The risk-reward has become more complex\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played rock successfully/neutrally twice recently\n   - They might continue with rock since it's working\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) against rock\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - This could be my chance to capitalize on their rock experimentation\n\n[move] Paper - capitalizing on their apparent new willingness to play rock, seeking the high-value +3 point victory"

Opponent behavior insights:\n   - Strong preference for scissors (87.5% of plays)\n   - Capable of strategic thinking (the paper counter-attack)\n   - But seems to revert to scissors as their comfort zone\n   - May not have a complex long-term strategy beyond occasional adaptation\n\n4.

Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock has been overwhelmingly successful against this opponent\n   - Their paper play might have been a one-time lesson/punishment\n   - The strong return to scissors suggests rock remains optimal\n   - Expected value of rock is strongly positive\n\n6. Risk evaluation:\n   - High probability (~85%) they play scissors again: rock wins +1\n   - Low probability (~15%) they play paper: rock loses -3\n   - Expected value: (0.85 \u00d7 +1) + (0.15 \u00d7 -3) = +0.4\n\n7.

Review the current situation:\n   - Round 19: Both played scissors (tie 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - They broke their paper punishment pattern for the first time\n\n2. Significant pattern break analysis:\n   - Previously, they punished rock victories with paper in rounds 6, 9, 12, 14\n   - Round 18: I won with rock, but round 19: they played scissors (not paper)\n   - This is the first time they didn't punish a rock victory with paper\n   - Their behavior is becoming less predictable\n\n3. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 14 out of 19 times (74%) - still dominant\n   - Paper: 4 out of 19 times (21%) - punishment strategy seems weakened\n   - Rock: 1 out of 19 times (5%) - still experimental\n   - They're showing more variation in their reactive strategy\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent may be adapting their strategy permanently\n   - They might be moving away from predictable paper punishments\n   - The rock experiment and now avoiding paper suggests evolving play\n   - I can't rely on the old patterns as much\n\n5. Current momentum analysis:\n   - They just played scissors and it resulted in a tie\n   - They might continue with scissors (their clear preference)\n   - Or they might finally use the paper punishment they skipped\n   - Or experiment with rock again\n\n6. Risk-reward assessment:\n   - Rock vs likely scissors: +1 point (historically successful)\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points (dangerous)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (safe)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 point (small loss)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Despite pattern changes, scissors remains their overwhelming preference\n   - They played scissors in the last 3 out of 4 rounds (15, 17, 18, 19)\n   - Rock has been my most successful strategy overall\n   - Even with evolving patterns, the basic scissors preference seems intact\n\n[move] Rock - exploiting their continued scissors preference despite their evolving strategic patterns",

Review this major development:\n   - Round 20: Both played rock (tie 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - This is only their second rock play, but now in rounds 16 and 20\n   - They're diversifying their strategy much more\n\n2. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Scissors: 14 out of 20 times (70%) - still majority but declining\n   - Paper: 4 out of 20 times (20%) - punishment strategy\n   - Rock: 2 out of 20 times (10%) - increasing frequency\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more balanced\n\n3. Strategic evolution evidence:\n   - Round 16: First rock (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 19: Avoided paper punishment (played scissors instead)\n   - Round 20: Second rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They're clearly adapting and becoming less pattern-dependent\n\n4. Opponent's apparent new strategy:\n   - Moving away from pure scissors dominance\n   - Incorporating rock as a legitimate option\n   - Less predictable paper punishment timing\n   - More varied and adaptive play\n\n5. Implications for my strategy:\n   - I can't rely on the old scissors-dominant pattern\n   - They might continue experimenting with rock\n   - Or return to scissors (still their most common move)\n   - Or use paper strategically\n\n6. Next move considerations:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) if they continue rock experimentation\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) if they return to comfort zone\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) if they use delayed punishment\n   - The risk-reward has become more complex\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played rock successfully/neutrally twice recently\n   - They might continue with rock since it's working\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) against rock\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - This could be my chance to capitalize on their rock experimentation\n\n[move] Paper - capitalizing on their apparent new willingness to play rock, seeking the high-value +3 point victory",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Opponent's strategic behavior insights:\n   - Primary preference: scissors (default strategy)\n   - Secondary tactic: paper (used to punish my rock plays)\n   - They seem to revert to scissors when not actively countering\n   - They may be thinking I'll avoid rock now after being punished twice\n\n4. Current strategic situation:\n   - I've been hurt badly by their paper counters (-6 points from those alone)\n   - My rock plays are being tracked and punished\n   - But scissors remains their most common play\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock now\n\n5. Reverse psychology consideration:\n   - They may think I'm now afraid to play rock\n   - If they expect me to avoid rock, they might return to scissors\n   - This could be the perfect time to go back to rock\n   - They can't punish my rock with paper if they're playing scissors\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock vs likely scissors: +1 point (good)\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points (painful but maybe less likely now)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (safe but no progress)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 point (small loss)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - They just played scissors, reinforcing it as their preference\n   - They might not expect me to return to rock immediately after being punished\n   - I need to score points to recover from my -4 deficit\n   - The element of surprise might work in my favor\n\n[move] Rock - catching them off-guard by returning to rock when they might expect me to avoid it after being punished with paper",

Opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - They maintain scissors as their base strategy\n   - They strategically deploy paper to counter my rock when I get successful\n   - They seem to anticipate my moves better now\n   - The fact they played scissors when I expected paper shows they're thinking multi-level\n\n4.

Current situation assessment:\n   - I'm down 4 points and need to recover\n   - The opponent has never played rock - this could be an opportunity\n   - They seem most comfortable with scissors, occasionally using paper strategically\n   - Rock still has the highest positive value when it works\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - if they finally play rock, this is huge\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - still works against their most common play\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - counters their strategic paper plays\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They've never played rock, but might try it as their next adaptation\n   - If they stick with scissors (most likely), rock wins +1\n   - If they play paper (to counter expected rock), I need scissors\n   - But if they play rock for the first time, paper gives me +3\n\nGiven their pattern of never playing rock and my need to recover points, I'll target the high-value scenario.\n\n[move] Paper - betting on the possibility they'll finally try rock, or at minimum tying if they stick with scissors won't hurt much",

Current tactical situation:\n   - I just won with rock against their scissors\n   - Historically, this has often triggered their paper punishment\n   - Paper punishments came in rounds 6, 9, 12, 14 (after rock victories)\n   - But the pattern was disrupted by their rock experiment\n\n5. Prediction considerations:\n   - Will they return to punishing rock victories with paper?\n   - Or has their strategy evolved beyond the simple punishment pattern?\n   - They might expect me to expect paper and play scissors instead\n   - The pattern disruption makes prediction more uncertain\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors vs possible paper: +1 point (if they maintain punishment pattern)\n   - Scissors vs possible scissors: 0 points (if they abandon punishment)\n   - Rock vs possible paper: -3 points (risky if punishment pattern holds)\n\n7. Decision:\n   - Play defensively against potential paper punishment\n   - The punishment pattern existed before their rock experiment\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only tie rather than lose badly\n   - Better to be safe while their strategy is somewhat unpredictable\n\n[move] Scissors - defending against their potential return to the paper punishment pattern while maintaining upside if they follow through",

Risk assessment:\n   - If they resume punishment pattern and play paper: scissors wins +1\n   - If they continue scissors: scissors ties 0\n   - If they surprise with rock again: scissors loses -1\n   - Scissors has positive or neutral outcomes in most scenarios\n\n6.

Implications for prediction:\n   - The old patterns are breaking down\n   - I can no longer rely on scissors/paper predictions\n   - They're showing genuine strategic thinking and adaptation\n   - This is now closer to a truly random or mixed strategy game\n\n6. Strategic options analysis:\n   - Against a more random opponent, I need to consider expected values:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - With their increasing rock usage, paper becomes more attractive\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it hits\n   - Even if they play scissors (still most common), I only lose 1 point\n   - Their strategy evolution suggests they might continue experimenting with rock\n\n[move] Paper - adapting to their increased rock usage and potential continued experimentation with this newer strategy element",
