    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Playing paper has the highest potential reward if I win\n   - But it also has the highest potential penalty if I lose\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), they might not realize the payoff differences\n\n4. Reason about opponent behavior:\n   - Fresh players often don't analyze payoff matrices carefully\n   - They might play randomly or follow common patterns\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If opponent plays rock (common for beginners), paper gives me +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The high reward for paper beating rock makes it worth the risk\n\n[move] paper"

Consider what the opponent might do next:\n   - They just lost with rock against my paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper\n   - Or they might stick with rock if they don't understand the payoffs\n   - Or they might try paper themselves after seeing it win\n\n3.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Playing paper again is risky if they learned to counter with scissors\n   - The opponent might try scissors to beat my previous winning move (paper)\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors and give me +1 point\n   - This is a safer play with moderate reward\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Since the opponent likely learned that paper beat their rock, they may try scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point, which is a solid, safe choice\n\n[move] rock"
