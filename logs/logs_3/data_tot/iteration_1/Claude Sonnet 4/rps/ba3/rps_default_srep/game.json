They've shown they can surprise me (the paper play), but they also tend to fall back into familiar patterns. Key observations:\n\n1. Scissors is still their most frequent move (9 out of 14 rounds)\n2. They just tied with scissors rather than losing, so it wasn't punished\n3. They might expect me to play rock again (since I played it so much before)\n4. They could try paper again since it worked so well last time\n\nIf they play scissors again, I should play rock to beat it (+1 point)\nIf they play paper again, rock loses (-3 points)\nIf they play rock, it's a tie with rock (0 points)\n\nGiven their tendency to return to scissors after experimenting, and the fact that they just played it, I think scissors is likely again. I'll go with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

Even if they're planning to switch, they might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked), so they could switch to paper to beat my expected rock.\n\nBut the pattern is so strong that I think scissors is still most likely.

This shows they're actively predicting my moves and responding strategically.\n\nThe opponent has evolved into a very adaptive player who:\n1. Uses paper frequently for high rewards\n2. Employs rock strategically to counter my scissors\n3. Mixes in scissors when needed\n4. Reads and counters my patterns\n\nThey seem to have identified that when I play scissors (to counter their paper), they can beat it with rock. This is becoming a rock-paper-scissors metagame where they're one step ahead of my predictions.\n\nFor their next move, they might:\n- Continue with rock (since it's working against my scissors tendency)\n- Go back to paper (their favorite high-reward move)\n- Try scissors (if they expect me to switch to paper)\n\nSince rock has worked twice recently against my scissors, and they might expect me to avoid scissors now, they could go back to paper. But they might also stick with rock if they think I'll try scissors again.\n\nI think I need to break the pattern. I'll try paper to potentially counter rock.\n\n[move] paper",

My total score drops to -6 points.\n\nTheir recent pattern shows complete strategic mastery:\n- Round 19: Paper\n- Round 20: Rock (beat my scissors)\n- Round 21: Paper  \n- Round 22: Rock (beat my scissors again)\n- Round 23: Scissors (beat my paper)\n\nThey're now fluidly cycling through all three moves based on what they expect me to play:\n- When I played scissors (to counter their paper), they used rock\n- When I switched to paper (to counter their rock), they used scissors\n\nThis opponent has become extremely sophisticated. They're not just mixing moves randomly - they're actively predicting my responses and countering them effectively. They've figured out the meta-game.\n\nLooking at the last 5 rounds, they've used each move strategically:\n- Paper: For high rewards when safe\n- Rock: To counter my scissors plays  \n- Scissors: To counter my paper plays\n\nThey're essentially playing one move ahead of me consistently. This is no longer about their patterns - it's about predicting what I'll do based on what they just did.\n\nFor their next move, they might expect me to:\n- Try rock (to counter their scissors)\n- Go back to scissors (to counter potential paper)\n- Continue with paper\n\nGiven that scissors just worked for them, they might expect me to counter with rock, so they could play paper to beat rock.\n\nI'll go with rock to try to break their prediction cycle.\n\n[move] rock",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This confirms that paper has become their preferred move - likely because of the +3 point reward when it wins. They're willing to risk the -1 penalty when it loses because the potential gain is so much higher.\n\nLooking at their last 6 rounds: Paper (4 times), Scissors (1 time), Rock (1 time). Paper is clearly their new strategic focus, with occasional mixing.\n\nThe opponent has learned that:\n1. Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio for them\n2. I'm now countering with scissors sometimes\n3. They need to keep some unpredictability\n\nFor their next move, given their strong paper preference lately, they might:\n- Play paper again (their current favorite)\n- Mix with scissors or rock to throw me off\n- Try to counter my scissors with rock\n\nSince they seem committed to paper as their primary strategy now (despite just losing with it), and given the high reward it offers, I think there's a good chance they'll try paper again. I'll stick with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors",
