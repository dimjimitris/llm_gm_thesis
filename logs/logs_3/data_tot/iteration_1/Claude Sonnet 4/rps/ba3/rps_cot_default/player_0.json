    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for first move against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might choose randomly or go with rock (common first choice)\n   - If they choose rock, I should play paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (vs rock), worst case -1 (vs scissors)\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1 (vs scissors), worst case -3 (vs paper)\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (vs paper), worst case -1 (vs rock)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and moderate risk (-1)\n   - Rock has low reward (+1) but highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock, making paper a strong opening choice\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a potentially rock-heavy fresh player"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This tells me the opponent also might be thinking strategically about the high-value paper move\n\n2. Updated opponent analysis:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, suggesting they're not just randomly picking or defaulting to rock\n   - They may also recognize paper's high-value potential\n   - This could indicate more strategic thinking than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they stick with paper (thinking it's the best option), I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to counter expected paper plays, they might go scissors, so I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they go rock (thinking others will play paper), I should play paper (+3)\n\n4. Meta-game considerations:\n   - After a tie, players often switch moves\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch away from paper\n   - They might counter-pick scissors expecting me to play paper again\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis for this round:\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Given the opponent showed strategic thinking by picking paper initially, they might continue with paper or expect me to switch\n   - Scissors gives me a good chance to beat paper while having moderate downside\n   - It's a reasonable counter to their demonstrated preference\n\n[move] Scissors - Countering the paper strategy while maintaining reasonable risk"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-3: Ties (paper, scissors, paper)\n   - Round 4: I rock, they paper (-3 for me)\n   - Round 5: I scissors, they rock (-1 for me)\n   - Round 6: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I scissors, they rock (-1 for me)\n   - Round 8: I paper, they scissors (-1 for me)\n   - Round 9: Both rock (tie)\n   - My total: -6 points\n\n2. Critical observation from round 9:\n   - For the first time since the early rounds, we tied again\n   - They chose rock, the same \"obvious\" move I did\n   - This suggests either they're also thinking more simply now, or they predicted I'd go obvious\n\n3. Opponent's full sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - After being highly predictive of my moves, they just made the same choice I did\n\n4. Possible explanations:\n   - They're also getting tired of the complex meta-game and reverting to simpler logic\n   - They predicted I'd choose the obvious counter (rock) and chose it too for some reason\n   - They're setting up for another prediction by appearing to simplify\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The tie breaks their winning streak against me\n   - They might continue with rock (if they're simplifying)\n   - They might expect me to counter rock with paper\n   - They might expect me to think they're simplifying and play unpredictably\n\n6. Game theory perspective:\n   - After 9 rounds of complex play, both players might benefit from mixed strategies\n   - My deficit means I need to start scoring points consistently\n   - The opponent has been successful with their prediction strategy but just tied\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - high reward if they stick with rock or expect me to play rock\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - moderate reward if they switch to paper expecting my paper\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - low reward, high risk if they play paper\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The tie might indicate a shift in their strategy\n   - If they're reverting to simpler play and might stick with rock, paper gives maximum points\n   - If they're still predicting and expect me to play paper (to beat rock), they might play scissors, but that's only -1 risk\n   - Given my -6 deficit, I need to take calculated risks for high rewards\n\n[move] Paper - Going for maximum points, betting on either their simplification or their expectation that I'll avoid the obvious high-reward play"

New approach needed:\n   - Stop trying to outsmart them - they're clearly better at that game\n   - Focus on basic probability and risk management\n   - Accept that I might not be able to predict them, but I can minimize damage\n\n6. Simple analysis for round 11:\n   - They just played scissors and have used it 3 times recently\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they predict I'll play rock and switch to paper, I lose -3\n   - If they stick with scissors or switch to rock, I either win +1 or tie\n\n7.

What worked in round 11:\n   - Simple, direct counter-play (rock beats scissors)\n   - Abandoned complex prediction strategies\n   - Focused on basic game mechanics instead of meta-gaming\n\n3. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last few moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played scissors in rounds 8, 10, and 11\n   - They might be developing a scissors preference, or this could be coincidental\n\n4.

Fundamental realization:\n   - I may be overthinking the very concept of \"strategy\"\n   - This opponent might be using true mixed strategy or superior reading skills\n   - My logical approaches are inherently flawed against this level of play\n\n6. New approach - minimal reasoning:\n   - Stop trying to predict or counter-predict\n   - Stop looking for patterns\n   - Stop using complex logic\n   - Just pick based on immediate, simple preference\n\n7. Move selection without overthinking:\n   - They just played scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Don't think about whether they expect this\n   - Don't think about patterns or meta-games\n   - Just play the basic counter\n\n8. Decision:\n   - Play rock because it beats scissors\n   - No deeper reasoning\n   - No prediction attempts\n   - Pure mechanical response\n\n[move] Rock - Simple mechanical counter to scissors, no strategic thinking involved"
