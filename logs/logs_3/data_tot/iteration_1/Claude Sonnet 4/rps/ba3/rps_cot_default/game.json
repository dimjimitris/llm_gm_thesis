Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for first move against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player might choose randomly or go with rock (common first choice)\n   - If they choose rock, I should play paper for maximum points (+3)\n   - If they choose paper, I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they choose scissors, I should play rock (+1)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (vs rock), worst case -1 (vs scissors)\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1 (vs scissors), worst case -3 (vs paper)\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (vs paper), worst case -1 (vs rock)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and moderate risk (-1)\n   - Rock has low reward (+1) but highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock, making paper a strong opening choice\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a potentially rock-heavy fresh player"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This tells me the opponent also might be thinking strategically about the high-value paper move\n\n2. Updated opponent analysis:\n   - The opponent chose paper in round 1, suggesting they're not just randomly picking or defaulting to rock\n   - They may also recognize paper's high-value potential\n   - This could indicate more strategic thinking than a typical \"fresh player\"\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they stick with paper (thinking it's the best option), I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to counter expected paper plays, they might go scissors, so I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they go rock (thinking others will play paper), I should play paper (+3)\n\n4. Meta-game considerations:\n   - After a tie, players often switch moves\n   - The opponent might expect me to switch away from paper\n   - They might counter-pick scissors expecting me to play paper again\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis for this round:\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses badly to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Given the opponent showed strategic thinking by picking paper initially, they might continue with paper or expect me to switch\n   - Scissors gives me a good chance to beat paper while having moderate downside\n   - It's a reasonable counter to their demonstrated preference\n\n[move] Scissors - Countering the paper strategy while maintaining reasonable risk"

Critical observation from round 9:\n   - For the first time since the early rounds, we tied again\n   - They chose rock, the same \"obvious\" move I did\n   - This suggests either they're also thinking more simply now, or they predicted I'd go obvious\n\n3.

Possible explanations:\n   - They're also getting tired of the complex meta-game and reverting to simpler logic\n   - They predicted I'd choose the obvious counter (rock) and chose it too for some reason\n   - They're setting up for another prediction by appearing to simplify\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The tie breaks their winning streak against me\n   - They might continue with rock (if they're simplifying)\n   - They might expect me to counter rock with paper\n   - They might expect me to think they're simplifying and play unpredictably\n\n6. Game theory perspective:\n   - After 9 rounds of complex play, both players might benefit from mixed strategies\n   - My deficit means I need to start scoring points consistently\n   - The opponent has been successful with their prediction strategy but just tied\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - high reward if they stick with rock or expect me to play rock\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - moderate reward if they switch to paper expecting my paper\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - low reward, high risk if they play paper\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - The tie might indicate a shift in their strategy\n   - If they're reverting to simpler play and might stick with rock, paper gives maximum points\n   - If they're still predicting and expect me to play paper (to beat rock), they might play scissors, but that's only -1 risk\n   - Given my -6 deficit, I need to take calculated risks for high rewards\n\n[move] Paper - Going for maximum points, betting on either their simplification or their expectation that I'll avoid the obvious high-reward play"

New approach needed:\n   - Stop trying to outsmart them - they're clearly better at that game\n   - Focus on basic probability and risk management\n   - Accept that I might not be able to predict them, but I can minimize damage\n\n6. Simple analysis for round 11:\n   - They just played scissors and have used it 3 times recently\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they predict I'll play rock and switch to paper, I lose -3\n   - If they stick with scissors or switch to rock, I either win +1 or tie\n\n7. Risk management:\n   - I'm down -7 points and desperately need to score\n   - Rock vs scissors gives +1 (decent)\n   - Rock vs paper gives -3 (bad but I'm already deep in deficit)\n   - Rock vs rock gives 0 (neutral)\n\n8.

What worked in round 11:\n   - Simple, direct counter-play (rock beats scissors)\n   - Abandoned complex prediction strategies\n   - Focused on basic game mechanics instead of meta-gaming\n\n3. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last few moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played scissors in rounds 8, 10, and 11\n   - They might be developing a scissors preference, or this could be coincidental\n\n4. Strategic considerations for round 12:\n   - I finally broke their prediction streak by simplifying my approach\n   - They might adjust their strategy now that I won\n   - They could return to their earlier paper preference\n   - Or they might try to counter-predict my newfound \"simple\" approach\n\n5.

Decision reasoning:\n   - The tie might indicate a shift in their strategy\n   - If they're reverting to simpler play and might stick with rock, paper gives maximum points\n   - If they're still predicting and expect me to play paper (to beat rock), they might play scissors, but that's only -1 risk\n   - Given my -6 deficit, I need to take calculated risks for high rewards\n\n[move] Paper - Going for maximum points, betting on either their simplification or their expectation that I'll avoid the obvious high-reward play",

Go back to fundamentals\n\nSince paper has the highest reward potential (+3) and they just used it successfully, they might either:\n- Try it again since it worked so well\n- Switch to something else expecting me to counter with scissors\n\nGiven how well they're playing now, I think they'll expect me to try scissors to counter their successful paper. If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock.\n\nI'll go with paper - both for its high value and because if they play rock (expecting my scissors), paper will give me the big +3 comeback.\n\n[move] paper"

They might have finally recognized that I was successfully exploiting their paper tendency with scissors, so they switched to rock to counter it.\n\nTheir recent moves show some learning:\n- Rounds 18, 20, 22: Paper (mostly lost to my scissors)\n- Rounds 19, 23: Rock (both times beating my scissors)\n\nThey seem to use rock specifically to counter my scissors strategy, which is smart. When they recognize I'm expecting paper and will play scissors, they switch to rock.\n\nFor round 24, I need to consider:\n- They just succeeded with rock against my scissors (again)\n- They might stick with rock since it's worked twice now\n- Or they might go back to paper (their historical favorite)\n- They could be alternating between rock (to beat scissors) and paper (for high value)\n\nSince rock just worked for them again, and they've now won with rock twice when I played scissors, they might either:\n1. Stick with rock (riding the success)\n2. Return to paper (their default high-value move)\n\nIf they stick with rock, I should play paper for the big +3.\nIf they return to paper, I should play scissors.\n\nGiven that rock has now worked for them twice in similar situations, there's a reasonable chance they'll try it again.\n\n[move] paper",

Pattern recognition:\n   - When we both played the same move (rounds 1-3), they mirrored me perfectly\n   - When I deviated (rounds 4-5), they successfully countered both times\n   - Round 6: We both returned to paper - back to mirroring\n\n4. Key insight about opponent behavior:\n   - They seem to have two modes: mirroring when we tie, and counter-predicting when I break ties\n   - They're very good at anticipating my moves after I lose\n   - They default back to paper (their apparent favorite) when resetting\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue the mirroring behavior after ties, they might play paper again\n   - If they switch to counter-prediction mode, they might expect me to try scissors (to beat paper)\n   - The opponent has shown they can successfully read my reactions to losses\n\n6. Decision framework:\n   - Option 1: Play scissors - directly counters their paper preference (+1 if right, -1 if they play rock)\n   - Option 2: Play paper - ties if they mirror, loses if they predict I'll counter (-1 to scissors)\n   - Option 3: Play rock - beats scissors if they counter-predict me playing paper, loses big to their paper preference\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - The opponent just tied with paper and might stick with their favorite move\n   - Given their pattern, scissors gives me the best chance of finally scoring points\n   - The downside is manageable (-1) compared to the potential upside (+1)\n\n[move] Scissors - Directly targeting their clear paper preference to finally score points",

Key insight:\n   - When I try to counter-predict (rounds 4-5), I lose\n   - When I make the same strategic choice as early rounds (round 6), we tie\n   - The opponent seems to favor paper as their base strategy, with occasional tactical switches\n\n4. Opponent strategy assessment:\n   - They likely recognize paper as the highest-value move (+3 when winning)\n   - They occasionally switch when they predict I'll counter with scissors\n   - They returned to paper in round 6, suggesting it's their comfort zone\n\n5. Strategic recalibration:\n   - My complex counter-predictions have failed\n   - The opponent seems to default to paper unless they have reason to switch\n   - They might continue with paper, especially after a successful tie that stopped my momentum\n\n6. Decision options:\n   - Scissors: Direct counter to paper (+1 if they stick with paper, -1 if rock)\n   - Rock: Risky given their paper preference (-3 loss potential)\n   - Paper: Safe tie if they stick with paper, but doesn't help my deficit\n\n7.

Recent opponent moves analysis:\n   - Last 3 moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 16 and 18)\n   - This might indicate a shift toward scissors preference\n\n6. Basic counter-logic for round 19:\n   - They just played scissors again\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - This is the straightforward, obvious counter\n\n7. Final strategic mindset:\n   - Stop trying to outsmart someone who's clearly better at prediction\n   - Play basic rock-paper-scissors fundamentals\n   - Accept whatever outcome comes from simple play\n   - Focus on occasionally scoring rather than complex strategies\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - Rock beats their recent scissors plays\n   - It's the fundamental counter\n   - I'll play honest, basic game strategy and see what happens\n\n[move] Rock - Playing the basic counter to scissors, accepting that straightforward play is my best remaining option at this skill disadvantage",
