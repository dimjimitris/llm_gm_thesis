    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This creates an asymmetric game where winning with paper is much more valuable.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about this payoff asymmetry, they might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition. Many players tend to start with rock as it's psychologically appealing as the \"strong\" option.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest payoff, and considering that inexperienced players often favor rock, paper seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] paper"

They've won 3 rounds in a row:\n- Round 11: Rock beat my scissors (-1)\n- Round 12: Scissors beat my paper (-1) \n- Round 13: Paper beat my rock (-3)\n\nThey just executed a perfect rock-paper-scissors cycle while I kept guessing wrong. This shows they've either:\n1. Figured out how to read my strategy\n2. Started playing more unpredictably \n3. Are now thinking several moves ahead\n\nTheir last three moves were: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\nThis is the complete cycle, and they caught me with the worst possible loss (paper beating rock for -3).\n\nFor round 14, I need to reset my thinking. They've shown they can be unpredictable now and are successfully countering my predictions. I should probably:\n1. Not overthink this\n2. Consider that they might expect me to be rattled\n3. Go back to fundamentals\n\nSince paper has the highest reward potential (+3) and they just used it successfully, they might either:\n- Try it again since it worked so well\n- Switch to something else expecting me to counter with scissors\n\nGiven how well they're playing now, I think they'll expect me to try scissors to counter their successful paper. If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock.\n\nI'll go with paper - both for its high value and because if they play rock (expecting my scissors), paper will give me the big +3 comeback.\n\n[move] paper"
