Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock as their first move since it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest payoff (+3 points), and many new players tend to choose rock initially, paper seems like the optimal choice for maximizing expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The opponent switched from their paper obsession and played rock, beating my scissors for -1 point.\n\nCurrent score analysis:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point  \n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -3 points\n- Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Total: +5 points\n\nThe opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\nThis is interesting! After losing twice in a row to my scissors (rounds 8-9), they finally adapted and switched to rock. This suggests they are learning and can adjust their strategy when it's clearly not working.\n\nNow I need to predict their next move:\n- They just successfully countered my scissors with rock\n- They might stick with rock (since it just worked)\n- They might go back to paper (their favored strategy)\n- They might try scissors (completing a rock \u2192 scissors transition)\n\nGiven that they just had success with rock after being stuck in a paper loop, they might try rock again. But they also might think I'll now counter with paper (since rock just beat me).\n\nIf they play rock again, I should play paper (+3 points).\nIf they go back to paper, I should play scissors (+1 point).\nIf they try scissors, I should play rock (+1 point).\n\nSince rock just worked for them and paper offers me the highest reward, I'll bet on them repeating rock and counter with paper.\n\n[move] paper",

The opponent did stick with rock after it worked, and my paper beat it for +3 points.\n\nCurrent score analysis:\n- Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point  \n- Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -3 points\n- Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 14: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -3 points\n- Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Total: +17 points\n\nThe opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\nThey're now playing rock for the second consecutive time (rounds 22-23). This follows their exact behavioral pattern of starting new fixation phases after successfully breaking previous ones.\n\nTheir established pattern:\n- First paper phase: 5 out of 6 rounds\n- First rock phase: 5 consecutive rounds (rounds 10-14)\n- Scissors phase: 3 consecutive rounds\n- Second paper phase: 4 consecutive rounds (rounds 18-21)\n- New rock phase: 2 consecutive rounds and likely continuing\n\nGiven their strong tendency to fixate on successful moves, and that rock just worked in round 22 but then lost to my paper in round 23, they face a decision point. However, their historical pattern suggests they'll likely persist with rock for several more rounds despite the setback, just as they did in previous fixations.\n\nIf they continue with rock (most likely), I should play paper (+3 points).\nIf they switch to scissors (to counter expected paper), I should play rock (+1 point).\nIf they try paper, I should play scissors (+1 point).\n\nBased on their fixation behavior, rock is most likely. I'll continue exploiting this with paper.\n\n[move] paper",
