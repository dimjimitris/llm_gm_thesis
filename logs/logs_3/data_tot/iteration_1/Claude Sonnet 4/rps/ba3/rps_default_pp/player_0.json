    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new to the game), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure. Many people default to Rock in rock-paper-scissors games, so Paper could be a strong opening move to potentially gain 3 points.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the fresh player might choose randomly, making this somewhat of a gamble. But given the high reward potential and that this appears to be the first round, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent either got lucky with a random choice, or they understood the payoff structure and specifically chose scissors to counter a potential paper play\n2. The penalty for losing with paper is actually -1, not -3 as I initially thought from the rules (let me re-read... actually, scissors beats paper for +1/-1, so the -1 penalty is correct)\n\nSince my opponent just played scissors successfully, they might:\n- Stick with scissors if they think it worked well\n- Switch to something else to avoid being predictable\n- Try rock next as a common follow-up\n\nGiven that scissors just worked for them, I should avoid paper this round. Rock would beat scissors if they repeat their move, giving me +1 points. This seems like a reasonable strategic choice.\n\n[move] rock"

Following a pattern (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper?)\n3. Trying to counter what they think I'll play\n\nSince we both played rock this round, they might expect me to switch. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might play paper to beat rock (expecting me to repeat rock). \n\nHowever, I should consider the asymmetric payoffs again:\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1  \n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3\n\nThe high reward for paper beating rock is tempting, but it's also the highest risk. Given that my opponent has shown some unpredictability, I'll go with scissors - it beats paper (if they're trying to counter my potential rock repeat) and has a moderate risk/reward profile.\n\n[move] scissors"
