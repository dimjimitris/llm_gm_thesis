    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure. Many people default to rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's often seen as the \"strong\" or \"safe\" option.\n\nGiven this psychology and the high payoff for paper beating rock, I'll play paper as my opening move.\n\n[move] Paper"

They just won with scissors, so they might:\n- Stick with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n- Switch to rock if they expect me to counter with rock\n- Try paper themselves to go for the high-value win\n\nGiven that scissors only gives +1 when winning (unlike paper's +3), and they just succeeded with it, they might be tempted to try paper for the bigger payoff. However, if they think I learned my lesson about paper being risky, they might expect me to play rock.\n\nI think rock is a solid choice here - it beats scissors (if they repeat) and only loses -3 to paper (but wins +1 against scissors, creating a reasonable risk-reward ratio).\n\n[move] Rock"

They might have had similar reasoning to mine, expecting me to counter their previous scissors move with rock.\n\nNow I have a bit more data:\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played scissors (they won)\n- Round 2: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n\nThis suggests my opponent might be thinking strategically about the game. The fact that they also chose rock suggests they were either:\n1. Trying to counter what they expected from me\n2. Playing it safe with a \"middle ground\" option\n3. Following a pattern I haven't identified yet\n\nFor this round, I need to consider what they might expect. Since we just tied with rock, they might think:\n- I'll stick with rock again\n- I'll switch to scissors to beat rock\n- I'll go back to paper for the high reward\n\nGiven the payoff structure, scissors is actually a reasonable play here. It beats paper (if they go for the high-value move) and only loses -1 to rock (compared to paper's -3 loss). It's a relatively low-risk move with decent upside.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Alternatively, they could be reacting to what they think I'll do.\n\nSince they just lost with paper (giving up -1 points), they might be more cautious about using it again immediately. They could:\n1. Go back to scissors (which worked in Round 1)\n2. Try rock as a \"safe\" middle option\n3. Stick with paper if they think I won't expect it twice\n\nGiven that scissors just worked for me and they might expect me to change, I'm considering what would be most effective. Rock would beat scissors if they return to their Round 1 winning move. Paper would be high-risk/high-reward against rock.\n\nI think rock is the strategic choice here - it counters a potential return to scissors, and the risk-reward against their other options is reasonable.\n\n[move] Rock"
