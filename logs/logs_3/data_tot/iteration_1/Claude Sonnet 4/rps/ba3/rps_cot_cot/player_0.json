Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move since it's the first option mentioned and feels like a \"strong\" choice psychologically.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I want to choose paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n\n7. The potential upside (+3) outweighs the potential downside (-1), making paper a good strategic choice against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to maximize expected value, especially against a potentially inexperienced player who might default to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent also chose paper in the first round, which suggests they might have had similar reasoning to mine - either they also recognized paper's high value, or they were trying to counter an expected rock move.\n\n2. Now I have some information about this player - they're thinking strategically enough to choose paper, not just defaulting to rock like a completely naive player might.\n\n3. Since they chose paper last round, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (resulted in a tie rather than a loss)\n   - They might switch strategies, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n4. If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to win 1 point.\n\n5. If they think I'll stick with paper and try to counter me, they'd choose scissors, in which case I should choose rock.\n\n6. If they choose rock (perhaps thinking I'll switch away from paper), I should choose paper again for the +3 points.\n\n7. Given that this player showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, I think they're more likely to either repeat paper or try to counter my expected paper with scissors.\n\n8. Choosing scissors covers both of these scenarios well:\n   - If they repeat paper: I win +1 point\n   - If they choose scissors: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose rock: I lose -1 point\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper or create a tie if they're thinking similarly.\n\n[move] scissors"

Pattern observation: We've both been making the same strategic choices, suggesting this opponent thinks similarly to me.\n\n4. The opponent seems to be following a logical progression:\n   - Started with paper (high-value move)\n   - Switched to scissors (possibly to counter expected paper repetition)\n\n5. If they continue this pattern of strategic thinking, what would they choose next?\n   - They might expect me to choose rock next (to counter their scissors)\n   - Or they might choose rock themselves, thinking I'll stick with scissors\n   - They could also continue the cycle and go back to paper\n\n6. Looking at the sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - The natural cycle would be: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - If they choose rock next, I should choose paper for +3 points\n\n7. Alternatively, they might think I'm following the same cycle and try to counter my expected rock with paper, in which case I should choose scissors.\n\n8. Given the high reward for paper beating rock (+3 points vs +1 for other wins), and the possibility they'll choose rock to complete the cycle, paper offers the best risk/reward ratio.\n\n9.
