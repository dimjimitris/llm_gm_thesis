Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs: Paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (3 points) compared to the other winning combinations (1 point each).\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - If opponent plays rock frequently, I should play paper to get the high 3-point reward\n   - Even if wrong sometimes, the high payoff from paper vs rock makes it worth the risk\n\n4. First move decision: Since this is against a fresh player who might favor rock, and paper gives the highest possible reward, I should lead with paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain 3 points if opponent chooses rock, which new players often do.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They may have used the same logic I did (paper beats rock, high reward)\n   - Or they observed my paper choice somehow and matched it\n   - Fresh players who think one step ahead might also choose paper\n\n3. Adjust strategy for round 2:\n   - If opponent tends to play paper (either from similar reasoning or copying), I should play scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1 point, which is better than another tie\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point, which is less risky than the -3 from paper losing to scissors\n\n4. Meta-game consideration:\n   - The opponent showed they can think strategically by choosing paper\n   - They might stick with paper thinking I'll switch, or they might switch thinking I'll stick\n   - Playing scissors covers the scenario where they repeat paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper if opponent repeats their move, with acceptable downside risk.\n\n[move] scissors"
