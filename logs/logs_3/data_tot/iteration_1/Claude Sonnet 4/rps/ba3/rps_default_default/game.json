Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In classic rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels like the \"strongest\" option psychologically.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value, and considering that new players often default to rock, I'll take the calculated risk for the potential high reward.\n\n[move] paper",
