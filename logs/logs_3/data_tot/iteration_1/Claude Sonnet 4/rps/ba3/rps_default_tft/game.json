Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any particular strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the reasonable assumption that a new player might choose rock, I'll go with paper for the potential high reward.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent played paper three times in a row (rounds 10, 11, 12). After getting that big win with paper in round 11, they stuck with it. This shows they might be getting into a pattern or really like that +3 potential from paper.\n\nSince we just tied with paper, they might:\n- Continue with paper (they've played it 3 times in a row)\n- Switch away since the tie didn't advance their position\n- Expect me to counter paper with scissors and play rock\n\nThe fact that they played paper three straight times suggests they might be committed to this strategy. But after a tie, smart players often switch.\n\nIf they expect me to finally counter their paper spam with scissors, they'd play rock.\nIf they think I'll stick with paper again, they might play scissors to break the tie cycle.\nIf they continue with paper, we tie again.\n\nGiven their recent paper focus and the likelihood they expect me to counter it, I think rock is their most probable next move.\n\nIf they play rock, I want paper for the +3.\nIf they play scissors, I lose -1 with paper.\nIf they play paper again, we tie.\n\nI'll go with paper - the potential +3 payoff is worth the risk, especially since rock seems like their logical next move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent is becoming more predictable as I learn their patterns.\n\nRecent sequence: paper, paper, rock, scissors\n\nCurrent totals:\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Paper: 7 times  \n- Rock: 5 times\n\nThey went back to scissors (their most-used move) after the rock failure, exactly as I predicted. They expected me to repeat my successful paper and countered with scissors.\n\nAfter losing with scissors, they might:\n- Switch away from scissors since it just lost\n- Expect me to play rock again (since it just worked) and counter with paper for +3\n- Try something unpredictable\n\nIf they think I'll repeat rock (since it just won), they'd play paper for the big +3 payoff.\nIf they think I'll switch, they might go to rock or stick with scissors.\n\nGiven that I just won with rock and they've shown a pattern of trying to counter my successful moves, paper seems very likely from them.\n\nIf they play paper, I need scissors to beat it.\nIf they play rock, scissors loses -1.\nIf they play scissors again, we tie.\n\nThe risk/reward favors playing scissors - it beats paper (+1) and only loses to rock (-1). Given their tendency to go for the +3 paper play when they expect rock, I think scissors is the right call.\n\n[move] scissors",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent has a simple strategy: try to counter whatever move just won for me.\n\n- I won with paper \u2192 they played scissors\n- I won with rock \u2192 they're about to try paper (most likely)\n\nSince I just won with rock, they'll almost certainly expect me to either repeat rock or switch. If they expect me to repeat rock, they'll play paper for the +3.\n\nThis is exactly what happened in previous rounds:\n- Round 19: I won with paper \u2192 they played rock to counter expected paper repeat\n- Round 22: I won with scissors \u2192 they played rock to counter expected scissors repeat\n- Round 23: I won with paper \u2192 they played scissors to counter expected paper repeat\n\nFollowing this pattern, since I just won with rock, they should play paper to counter expected rock repeat.\n\nIf they play paper, I need scissors to beat it for +1.\n\n[move] scissors",
