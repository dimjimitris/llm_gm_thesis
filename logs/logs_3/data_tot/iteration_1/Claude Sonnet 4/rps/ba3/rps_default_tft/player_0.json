    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any particular strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the reasonable assumption that a new player might choose rock, I'll go with paper for the potential high reward.\n\n[move] paper"

This shows they might be getting into a pattern or really like that +3 potential from paper.\n\nSince we just tied with paper, they might:\n- Continue with paper (they've played it 3 times in a row)\n- Switch away since the tie didn't advance their position\n- Expect me to counter paper with scissors and play rock\n\nThe fact that they played paper three straight times suggests they might be committed to this strategy. But after a tie, smart players often switch.\n\nIf they expect me to finally counter their paper spam with scissors, they'd play rock.\nIf they think I'll stick with paper again, they might play scissors to break the tie cycle.\nIf they continue with paper, we tie again.\n\nGiven their recent paper focus and the likelihood they expect me to counter it, I think rock is their most probable next move.\n\nIf they play rock, I want paper for the +3.\nIf they play scissors, I lose -1 with paper.\nIf they play paper again, we tie.\n\nI'll go with paper - the potential +3 payoff is worth the risk, especially since rock seems like their logical next move.\n\n[move] paper"

Opponent: scissors, Me: rock (I won +1)\n\nTheir sequence: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors\n\nI'm on a 3-game winning streak! My opponent is becoming more predictable as I learn their patterns.\n\nRecent sequence: paper, paper, rock, scissors\n\nCurrent totals:\n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Paper: 7 times  \n- Rock: 5 times\n\nThey went back to scissors (their most-used move) after the rock failure, exactly as I predicted. They expected me to repeat my successful paper and countered with scissors.\n\nAfter losing with scissors, they might:\n- Switch away from scissors since it just lost\n- Expect me to play rock again (since it just worked) and counter with paper for +3\n- Try something unpredictable\n\nIf they think I'll repeat rock (since it just won), they'd play paper for the big +3 payoff.\nIf they think I'll switch, they might go to rock or stick with scissors.\n\nGiven that I just won with rock and they've shown a pattern of trying to counter my successful moves, paper seems very likely from them.\n\nIf they play paper, I need scissors to beat it.\nIf they play rock, scissors loses -1.\nIf they play scissors again, we tie.\n\nThe risk/reward favors playing scissors - it beats paper (+1) and only loses to rock (-1). Given their tendency to go for the +3 paper play when they expect rock, I think scissors is the right call.\n\n[move] scissors"
