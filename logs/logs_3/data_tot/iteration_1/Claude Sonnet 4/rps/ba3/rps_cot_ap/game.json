Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - paper beating rock gives much higher reward (+3/-3) compared to other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who hasn't developed patterns yet):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - If opponent plays rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n   - This is also the highest value winning move available\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (if opponent plays rock), worst case -1 (if opponent plays scissors), tie 0 (if opponent plays paper)\n   - The potential upside significantly outweighs the downside\n\n5. Make decision based on maximizing expected value against a fresh player who likely defaults to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's remarkable pattern:\n   - Last 6 rounds: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played paper 6 consecutive times!\n   - Despite losing twice with paper, they're not switching away from it\n\n3. Examine their commitment to paper:\n   - They're showing extreme persistence with paper strategy\n   - Even after clear losses to scissors, they continue with paper\n   - This suggests either a very stubborn strategy or they're trying to outlast my adaptations\n\n4. Consider what this tells me about their mindset:\n   - They might be committed to paper regardless of short-term losses\n   - They could be expecting me to eventually move away from scissors\n   - They might be playing a longer-term strategy of wearing down my adaptations\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - Given 6 straight papers, they might finally switch (adaptation pressure)\n   - Or they might stick with paper if they think I'll move away from scissors\n   - If they switch, rock would counter my expected scissors, scissors would counter my expected paper\n\n6. Evaluate the situation:\n   - Their paper obsession is clear and consistent\n   - Scissors has beaten their paper twice when I've used it\n   - They seem reluctant to abandon paper despite evidence it's not working against scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Their extreme commitment to paper suggests they might continue it\n   - Even if they're about to switch, the pattern is so strong that paper remains likely\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) and has been my successful counter\n   - Given their stubborn pattern, I should exploit it again\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the major pattern shift:\n   - They played paper 6 times in a row (rounds 6-10)\n   - Then suddenly switched to scissors in round 11\n   - This is their first non-paper move since round 5\n\n3. Examine their switching behavior:\n   - Early game: Heavy scissors preference\n   - Mid game: Switched to paper after rock countered scissors\n   - Recent: Committed heavily to paper despite losses\n   - Now: Back to scissors after extended paper phase\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning for the switch:\n   - They finally adapted after repeated scissors beating their paper\n   - They might be returning to their original scissors comfort zone\n   - They could be trying to counter my expected scissors continuation\n   - The tie might encourage them to stick with scissors\n\n5. Look at their historical behavior after switches:\n   - When they switched from scissors to paper, they committed to paper for many rounds\n   - They tend to stick with new strategies rather than flip-flop\n   - The scissors tie might reinforce this new direction\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Stay with scissors: Following their pattern of committing to new strategies\n   - Switch back to paper: Less likely given they just abandoned it\n   - Try rock: Possible to counter expected scissors, but doesn't match their commitment pattern\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they go back to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they try rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - Given their tendency to commit to strategies once they switch, and they just moved to scissors, rock seems like the best counter\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's remarkable scissors streak:\n   - They've now played scissors 5 times in a row (rounds 14-18)\n   - They've lost to rock in rounds 16 and 18, but haven't switched\n   - This is unprecedented persistence compared to their earlier behavior\n\n3. Examine their adaptation breaking point:\n   - Early game: They switched from scissors to paper after 2-3 rock defeats\n   - Current: They've now lost to rock twice in this streak and haven't switched\n   - They seem much more committed to scissors than before\n\n4. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be trying to outlast my rock strategy\n   - They could be expecting me to switch away from rock eventually\n   - They might be stuck in a scissors commitment and unable to adapt\n   - The one tie (round 17) might be giving them hope\n\n5. Look at the pressure to adapt:\n   - They're clearly losing the scissors vs rock matchup repeatedly\n   - Normal game theory would suggest switching to paper to counter rock\n   - But they're showing unusual persistence\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with scissors: Extreme commitment, but losing repeatedly\n   - Switch to paper: Logical counter to rock, matches their historical pattern\n   - Switch to rock: To mirror my successful strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock wins (+1) - exploit their persistence\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their adaptation\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3) - highest reward but less likely\n   - Given their extreme scissors persistence (5 rounds), they might finally break and switch to paper as their historical counter to rock\n   - But their stubbornness suggests they might play scissors one more time\n   - This is a critical decision point - I think they'll finally adapt to paper\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze their adaptation pattern:\n   - They finally switched from scissors to paper after 5 consecutive scissors (rounds 14-18)\n   - This matches their historical pattern: when rock repeatedly beats scissors, switch to paper\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors in round 19\n\n3. Examine their switching behavior after losses:\n   - When they lose with a new strategy, they sometimes switch quickly\n   - Or they might commit to the new strategy for multiple rounds\n   - Their paper just lost to scissors, similar to how scissors was losing to rock\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning now:\n   - Paper just lost to scissors, so they might switch again\n   - They could return to scissors (their comfort zone)\n   - They might try rock to counter my scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper for a few rounds like they did before\n\n5. Look at their commitment patterns:\n   - Early scissors phase: Multiple rounds\n   - Middle paper phase: 6 consecutive rounds  \n   - Recent scissors phase: 5 consecutive rounds\n   - New paper phase: Just started, might continue despite the loss\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Stay with paper: Following their pattern of committing to new strategies\n   - Switch to rock: To counter my successful scissors\n   - Return to scissors: Back to their original preference\n   - Given their tendency to commit to strategies for multiple rounds, and they just switched to paper, they might stick with it\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stay with paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)  \n   - If they return to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Their historical pattern suggests they'll commit to paper for several rounds, even after a loss\n   - Scissors is the optimal counter to exploit their expected paper commitment\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze their recent rapid switching:\n   - scissors (5 rounds) \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They're now switching after each loss instead of committing to strategies\n   - This is a major change from their earlier long commitment phases\n\n3. Examine their new adaptation pattern:\n   - Round 19: Lost with paper to scissors \u2192 switched to rock\n   - Round 20: Won with rock against scissors\n   - They're now adapting immediately after losses and finding success\n\n4. Consider their evolved strategy:\n   - They seem to have learned that long commitments get exploited\n   - They're now playing more reactively and adaptively\n   - They successfully countered my scissors with rock\n\n5. Look at their likely reasoning now:\n   - Rock just beat scissors successfully\n   - They might stick with rock if they think I'll continue with scissors\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to paper to counter rock\n   - Their new pattern suggests they'll adapt based on my expected response\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Stay with rock: Exploit their successful counter to scissors\n   - Switch to paper: If they expect me to switch to paper to counter rock\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely since rock is working\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their new rapid adaptation style and rock's recent success, they might stick with rock briefly\n   - But they also might expect me to counter with paper\n   - Paper gives me the highest reward (+3) if they stick with rock, and it's a reasonable gamble given their success with rock\n\n[move] paper"

Consider their likely reasoning after this loss:\n   - Paper just beat their rock with a high penalty (-3 points for them)\n   - This is the worst possible loss in the game\n   - They'll likely want to switch away from rock immediately\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper after such a big win\n\n5. Look at their switching patterns after big losses:\n   - Earlier, when they lost -3 (rock vs paper in round 6), they adapted quickly\n   - Big losses seem to trigger immediate strategy changes for them\n   - They'll likely switch to counter my expected paper continuation\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to scissors: Logical counter to paper, fits their rapid adaptation\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n   - Stay with rock: Very unlikely after the -3 loss\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they somehow stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), but very unlikely\n   - Given the severe -3 penalty they just took, they'll almost certainly switch to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Rock is the optimal counter to beat their expected scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Consider what this reveals about their strategy:\n   - They might be reverting to their old pattern of committing to strategies\n   - The tie in round 22 might encourage them to continue with rock\n   - They could be trying to outlast my adaptations again\n\n5. Look at their behavior after ties:\n   - Historically, ties sometimes encourage them to stick with their current choice\n   - They might see the tie as better than the loss and continue with rock\n   - Or they might finally switch after 3 rounds of rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their commitment pattern, especially after the tie\n   - Switch to paper: To counter my expected rock continuation\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely given their current rock commitment\n\n7.

Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who hasn't developed patterns yet):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - If opponent plays rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n   - This is also the highest value winning move available\n\n4.

Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with scissors: Rock wins (+1) - repeat my successful strategy\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their likely adaptation\n   - If they try rock: Paper wins (+3) - highest reward but less likely\n   - Given they just lost to rock and their history of switching strategies after losses, they might go back to paper (their previous counter to rock)\n   - But paper didn't work well for them recently, so they might try rock instead\n   - I think they'll try rock to counter my successful rock strategy\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic decision:\n   - If they stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their new rapid adaptation style and rock's recent success, they might stick with rock briefly\n   - But they also might expect me to counter with paper\n   - Paper gives me the highest reward (+3) if they stick with rock, and it's a reasonable gamble given their success with rock\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze their recent pattern:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played rock twice in a row (rounds 20-21)\n   - They won with rock in round 20, but lost with rock in round 21\n\n3. Examine their new rapid adaptation behavior:\n   - They're showing less commitment to strategies than before\n   - But they did repeat rock after it worked once\n   - Now they've lost with rock to my paper - will they switch again?\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning after this loss:\n   - Paper just beat their rock with a high penalty (-3 points for them)\n   - This is the worst possible loss in the game\n   - They'll likely want to switch away from rock immediately\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper after such a big win\n\n5. Look at their switching patterns after big losses:\n   - Earlier, when they lost -3 (rock vs paper in round 6), they adapted quickly\n   - Big losses seem to trigger immediate strategy changes for them\n   - They'll likely switch to counter my expected paper continuation\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to scissors: Logical counter to paper, fits their rapid adaptation\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n   - Stay with rock: Very unlikely after the -3 loss\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they somehow stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), but very unlikely\n   - Given the severe -3 penalty they just took, they'll almost certainly switch to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Rock is the optimal counter to beat their expected scissors\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze their recent surprising choice:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They played rock 3 times in a row (rounds 20-22)\n   - Despite losing badly with rock in round 21 (-3 points), they stuck with it\n\n3. Examine this unexpected persistence:\n   - I expected them to switch after the -3 loss, but they didn't\n   - They're showing commitment to rock despite the major loss\n   - This is more like their old long-commitment behavior\n\n4. Consider what this reveals about their strategy:\n   - They might be reverting to their old pattern of committing to strategies\n   - The tie in round 22 might encourage them to continue with rock\n   - They could be trying to outlast my adaptations again\n\n5. Look at their behavior after ties:\n   - Historically, ties sometimes encourage them to stick with their current choice\n   - They might see the tie as better than the loss and continue with rock\n   - Or they might finally switch after 3 rounds of rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their commitment pattern, especially after the tie\n   - Switch to paper: To counter my expected rock continuation\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely given their current rock commitment\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their 3-round rock commitment and the tie reinforcing their choice, they'll likely continue with rock\n   - Paper gives me the maximum reward (+3) for exploiting their rock persistence\n\n[move] paper",

Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be completely stuck on rock strategy\n   - They could be expecting me to eventually switch away from paper\n   - They might be playing some kind of long-term psychological game\n   - Or they're simply not adapting to the clear losing pattern\n\n5. Look at breaking points:\n   - Even in their most committed phases before, they eventually adapted\n   - Two -3 losses should be a massive signal to switch\n   - But they're showing unprecedented stubbornness\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their extreme commitment despite losses\n   - Finally switch to scissors: To counter my paper after massive penalties\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins (+3) - exploit their persistence\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1) - counter their adaptation\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their mirroring\n   - Given their extraordinary 4-round rock commitment despite -6 points in losses, they might incredibly continue with rock\n   - However, the pain threshold might finally be reached\n   - This is a critical decision point - they SHOULD switch, but their behavior suggests they might not\n   - I'll exploit their rock obsession one more time\n\n[move] paper",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what the opponent might be thinking:\n   - They saw I played paper in round 1, then rock in round 2, then paper again in round 3\n   - They might think I'm alternating between paper and rock\n   - Or they might think I favor paper (played it 2 out of 3 times)\n\n4. Evaluate likely opponent moves:\n   - If they think I'll play rock next (following the paper-rock-paper pattern), they might play paper\n   - If they think I favor paper, they might play scissors\n   - They could also try to be unpredictable and switch to rock\n\n5. Strategic analysis of my options:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they're thinking strategically (switching from scissors to paper)\n   - If they expect me to continue alternating or favor paper, they might play scissors\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors and is safer than paper (lower penalty if wrong)\n   - Rock also breaks any perceived pattern they might think I'm following\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze opponent's move sequence:\n   - scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - Pattern: They played paper twice, both times when I played the same move twice in a row\n   - Round 3: I played paper (after rock), they played paper\n   - Round 6: I played rock (after rock), they played paper\n\n3.

Evaluate probabilities:\n   - Continuing with paper: Seems less likely after 3 in a row and a tie\n   - Switching to scissors: Possible return to their original preference\n   - Switching to rock: Logical counter if they expect me to play scissors again\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm still down 1 point and need to gain ground\n   - Their paper streak suggests they might finally switch\n   - If they switch back to scissors (their historical favorite), rock beats it\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter expected scissors), paper beats it for +3\n   - If they stick with paper, scissors beats it for +1\n   - Scissors seems optimal - it beats their most likely continuation (paper) and only loses to rock\n\n[move] scissors",

Consider their likely reasoning:\n   - They've lost with scissors to rock twice in recent rounds\n   - Historically, this triggers a switch to paper\n   - But they also just came off a long paper phase that didn't work well\n   - They might be conflicted about switching back to paper\n\n5. Look at the adaptation pressure:\n   - Early game: Lost to rock with scissors in rounds 2, 5 \u2192 switched to paper in round 6\n   - Current: Lost to rock with scissors in rounds 12, 16 \u2192 might switch to paper in round 17\n   - The pattern suggests they're due for an adaptation\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to paper: Historical pattern when rock beats scissors repeatedly\n   - Stick with scissors: Less likely given repeated losses to rock\n   - Try rock: Possible counter to expected rock continuation\n\n7.

Examine their adaptation pattern confirmation:\n   - Early game: scissors \u2192 paper when rock countered\n   - Mid game: paper \u2192 scissors when scissors countered  \n   - Recent: scissors \u2192 paper when rock countered again\n   - They follow a predictable counter-adaptation cycle\n\n4. Consider their likely next move reasoning:\n   - They just switched to paper and lost to my scissors\n   - Historically, when their new strategy gets countered, they adapt again\n   - Following their pattern: paper loses to scissors \u2192 they might switch to rock\n   - Or they might stick with paper for a few rounds (like they did before)\n\n5. Look at their commitment vs. quick adaptation:\n   - Earlier they committed to strategies for multiple rounds\n   - But lately they've been quicker to switch when losing\n   - The paper switch suggests they're still following their adaptation patterns\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to rock: Following the cycle (rock counters scissors)\n   - Stay with paper: Following their commitment pattern after switching\n   - Back to scissors: Less likely since they just left it after losses\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they stay with paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they go back to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their tendency to commit to new strategies for at least a few rounds, and they just switched to paper, they'll likely stay with paper initially\n   - Scissors is the optimal counter to exploit their paper strategy\n\n[move] scissors",

Examine their current situation:\n   - Rock just lost to paper twice now (rounds 19 indirect, 21 direct)\n   - Following their new rapid adaptation pattern, they should switch\n   - They've seen that rock loses to paper with the high penalty (-3)\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning:\n   - They just lost badly (-3) with rock to paper\n   - They know I successfully countered their rock strategy\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper or switch to something else\n   - Their recent pattern suggests immediate adaptation after losses\n\n5. Look at their switching options:\n   - Switch to scissors: Would counter my paper and fits their adaptation pattern\n   - Switch to paper: Would tie with my expected paper continuation\n   - Stay with rock: Very unlikely after the big loss\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to scissors: Most likely, counters paper and follows their adaptation pattern\n   - Switch to paper: Possible if they expect me to stick with paper\n   - Stay with rock: Highly unlikely given the -3 loss\n\n7.

Analyze their recent surprising choice:\n   - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They played rock 3 times in a row (rounds 20-22)\n   - Despite losing badly with rock in round 21 (-3 points), they stuck with it\n\n3. Examine this unexpected persistence:\n   - I expected them to switch after the -3 loss, but they didn't\n   - They're showing commitment to rock despite the major loss\n   - This is more like their old long-commitment behavior\n\n4. Consider what this reveals about their strategy:\n   - They might be reverting to their old pattern of committing to strategies\n   - The tie in round 22 might encourage them to continue with rock\n   - They could be trying to outlast my adaptations again\n\n5. Look at their behavior after ties:\n   - Historically, ties sometimes encourage them to stick with their current choice\n   - They might see the tie as better than the loss and continue with rock\n   - Or they might finally switch after 3 rounds of rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their commitment pattern, especially after the tie\n   - Switch to paper: To counter my expected rock continuation\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely given their current rock commitment\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their 3-round rock commitment and the tie reinforcing their choice, they'll likely continue with rock\n   - Paper gives me the maximum reward (+3) for exploiting their rock persistence\n\n[move] paper",

          "output_text": "I need to analyze this excellent result and their continued rock commitment.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Current total score: +8 points\n\n2. Analyze their incredible rock persistence:\n   - They've now played rock 4 times in a row (rounds 20-23)\n   - They've lost -3 points twice with rock (rounds 21 and 23)\n   - Total damage from rock: -6 points in just 2 losses\n   - Yet they continue with rock despite massive penalties\n\n3. Examine this extreme commitment:\n   - This is beyond their historical commitment patterns\n   - They're taking severe punishment but not adapting\n   - This suggests either extreme stubbornness or a specific strategy\n\n4. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be trying to outlast my paper strategy\n   - They could be expecting me to eventually switch away from paper\n   - They might be stuck in a psychological commitment to rock\n   - The one tie (round 22) might be giving them false hope\n\n5. Look at the breaking point analysis:\n   - They've now taken -6 points from rock losses in this streak\n   - This is unsustainable if they want to win\n   - They must switch soon or continue losing badly\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Extreme commitment, but catastrophic losses continue\n   - Switch to scissors: Logical counter to paper, finally adapting\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins (+3) - continue exploiting their persistence\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1) - counter their adaptation\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their mirroring\n   - Given they've taken -6 points from rock and I've gained +6 from paper, they MUST adapt soon\n   - But their extreme persistence suggests they might play rock one more time\n   - This is a critical decision - their stubbornness is unprecedented\n   - I should continue exploiting their rock commitment with paper until they finally break\n\n[move] paper",
