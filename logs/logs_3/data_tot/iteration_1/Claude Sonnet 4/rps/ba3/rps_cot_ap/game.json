Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose Rock as it's often the default/most common first choice\n   - Not have a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - Play somewhat predictably\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock: I win +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\n5.

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 3: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie, 0)\n   - Round 4: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors (Tie, 0)\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 9: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper (Tie, 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n\n2. Analyze the striking tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 4 times out of 10 rounds (40%)\n   - Tie rounds: 3, 5, 6, 10\n   - This is statistically very unusual - suggests strong pattern recognition on their part\n\n3. Opponent's recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last 4 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper 3 consecutive times (rounds 8-10)\n   - This is a major shift from their early Scissors preference\n   - Still have NEVER played Rock in 10 rounds\n\n4. Key insight about their strategy evolution:\n   - Early rounds: Heavy Scissors bias\n   - Middle rounds: Strategic adaptation with Paper\n   - Recent rounds: Paper becoming their new default?\n   - They seem to be mirroring or predicting my moves more successfully\n\n5. Consider their perspective after round 10:\n   - They just tied with Paper again\n   - They might think I'm stuck in a Paper pattern now\n   - They could expect me to continue with Paper or switch away from it\n   - Their Paper strategy has been somewhat successful (1 big win, 2 ties, 1 loss)\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they stick with Paper (expecting me to change): I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock (their unused move): I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they return to Scissors (their old preference): I should play Rock (+1)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They've committed heavily to Paper lately (3 straight rounds)\n   - After another tie, they might expect me to switch away from Paper\n   - If they stick with their Paper trend, Scissors beats it\n   - Even if they switch to Scissors, the downside is only -1\n   - The probability of them finally using Rock after 10 rounds seems lower than them continuing with Paper\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze opponent's remarkable Paper streak:\n   - Their sequence: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper 4 consecutive times (rounds 8-11)\n   - This represents a complete shift from their early Scissors preference\n   - Still have NEVER played Rock in 11 rounds\n\n3. Key observations about their current state:\n   - They're locked into a Paper pattern now\n   - Paper worked once (round 8, +3 points), tied twice (rounds 10), and lost twice (rounds 9, 11)\n   - They might be getting frustrated with Paper's mixed results\n   - Or they might double down thinking it's still their best strategy\n\n4. Consider their psychology after losing round 11:\n   - They just lost with Paper for the second time to my Scissors\n   - They might finally realize their Paper strategy is being countered\n   - Options they might consider:\n     - Return to their old Scissors preference\n     - Finally try Rock (their unused move)\n     - Continue with Paper (stubbornly or hoping I'll switch)\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they return to Scissors: I should play Rock (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock: I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they stick with Paper: I should play Scissors (+1)\n\n6. Probability assessment:\n   - After 4 Paper losses/ties in a row, they're likely to change\n   - Scissors is their historical comfort zone (5 times in first 7 rounds)\n   - Rock remains completely unused but they might finally try it\n   - Continuing with Paper seems least likely after recent failures\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They're most likely to either return to Scissors or try Rock\n   - If they go back to Scissors, Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock, I lose (-3)\n   - Given their historical Scissors preference and recent Paper failures, Scissors return seems more probable\n   - Rock is the safer play that capitalizes on their likely return to their comfort zone\n\n[move] Rock"

Critical pattern recognition:\n   - Every time I've played Rock recently (rounds 8, 12), they've played Paper (-3 to me each time)\n   - They seem to have learned to counter my Rock plays specifically\n   - They're either predicting my Rock moves or have committed fully to Paper as anti-Rock strategy\n\n4. Reassess their strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Scissors preference with occasional strategic moves\n   - Recent game: Complete Paper dominance\n   - They've found a strategy that's working against me (Paper beats my Rock)\n   - Two -3 losses have significantly damaged my score\n\n5. Consider their mindset after round 12:\n   - They just won another -3 victory with Paper against my Rock\n   - They might think their Paper strategy is working perfectly\n   - They could continue with Paper expecting me to play Rock again\n   - Or they might finally switch thinking I'll adapt away from Rock\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they continue with Paper (thinking it's working): I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock (after 12 rounds): I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they return to Scissors: I should play Rock (+1)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They've been incredibly successful with their Paper strategy lately\n   - They've beaten my Rock twice in a row for major points\n   - They might continue this winning Paper streak\n   - Even if they switch to Scissors, I only lose -1 with Scissors\n   - Scissors is the safest counter to their likely Paper continuation\n\n[move] Scissors"

Key insights about their current strategy:\n   - They're completely locked into Paper now\n   - Results with Paper: Win, Tie, Loss, Loss, Win, Loss (mixed but they persist)\n   - They just lost to my Scissors again, but historically they don't seem to learn from Paper losses\n   - They've essentially abandoned their original Scissors preference entirely\n\n4. Pattern analysis of my successful counters:\n   - When I played Scissors against their Paper: I won (rounds 9, 11, 13)\n   - They seem unable or unwilling to break their Paper pattern despite repeated losses to my Scissors\n   - This suggests either extreme stubbornness or a deep strategic commitment\n\n5. Consider their psychology after round 13:\n   - They just lost with Paper to my Scissors for the third time\n   - Yet they've continued with Paper despite previous Scissors losses\n   - They might:\n     - Continue with Paper (based on their demonstrated persistence)\n     - Finally switch after multiple Scissors losses\n     - Try Rock for the first time ever\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they continue with Paper: I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock: I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they return to Scissors: I should play Rock (+1)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Their Paper commitment has been unwavering for 6 rounds\n   - They've shown they don't easily abandon Paper even after losses\n   - The pattern suggests they're more likely to continue than to break it\n   - Scissors has been consistently successful against their Paper strategy\n   - Even if wrong, most alternatives only cost me -1, but continuing to exploit their Paper fixation is likely profitable\n\n[move] (Their Paper streak continues despite losses so I'll keep countering) scissors"

Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose Rock as it's often the default/most common first choice\n   - Not have a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - Play somewhat predictably\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock: I win +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n\n5.

Final reasoning:\n   - They've been increasingly strategic\n   - After consecutive Paper plays and one failure, they might try something completely new\n   - Rock is the only move they haven't used - they might finally try it\n   - Paper gives me the best reward if they do\n\n[move] Paper",

Analyze the striking tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 4 times out of 10 rounds (40%)\n   - Tie rounds: 3, 5, 6, 10\n   - This is statistically very unusual - suggests strong pattern recognition on their part\n\n3. Opponent's recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last 4 moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper 3 consecutive times (rounds 8-10)\n   - This is a major shift from their early Scissors preference\n   - Still have NEVER played Rock in 10 rounds\n\n4. Key insight about their strategy evolution:\n   - Early rounds: Heavy Scissors bias\n   - Middle rounds: Strategic adaptation with Paper\n   - Recent rounds: Paper becoming their new default?\n   - They seem to be mirroring or predicting my moves more successfully\n\n5. Consider their perspective after round 10:\n   - They just tied with Paper again\n   - They might think I'm stuck in a Paper pattern now\n   - They could expect me to continue with Paper or switch away from it\n   - Their Paper strategy has been somewhat successful (1 big win, 2 ties, 1 loss)\n\n6.

Decision reasoning:\n   - They've committed heavily to Paper lately (3 straight rounds)\n   - After another tie, they might expect me to switch away from Paper\n   - If they stick with their Paper trend, Scissors beats it\n   - Even if they switch to Scissors, the downside is only -1\n   - The probability of them finally using Rock after 10 rounds seems lower than them continuing with Paper\n\n[move] Scissors",

Decision reasoning:\n   - They're most likely to either return to Scissors or try Rock\n   - If they go back to Scissors, Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they finally try Rock, I lose (-3)\n   - Given their historical Scissors preference and recent Paper failures, Scissors return seems more probable\n   - Rock is the safer play that capitalizes on their likely return to their comfort zone\n\n[move] Rock",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Meta-game analysis:\n   - The increasing ties suggest either:\n     - They're getting better at reading me\n     - We're falling into synchronized patterns\n     - They're deliberately trying to tie (unlikely given scoring system)\n\n7. Decision: Given their strong historical preference for Scissors (4/6 rounds) and the fact that trying to predict their predictions is getting complex, I'll go with the straightforward counter to their most frequent move.\n\n[move] Rock",
