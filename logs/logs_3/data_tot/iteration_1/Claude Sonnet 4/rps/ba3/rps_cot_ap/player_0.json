    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - paper beating rock gives much higher reward (+3/-3) compared to other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who hasn't developed patterns yet):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive first move\n   - If opponent plays rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n   - This is also the highest value winning move available\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (if opponent plays rock), worst case -1 (if opponent plays scissors), tie 0 (if opponent plays paper)\n   - The potential upside significantly outweighs the downside\n\n5. Make decision based on maximizing expected value against a fresh player who likely defaults to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're thinking I'll switch from paper after losing, they might expect rock or scissors\n   - If they won with scissors, they might stick with it or try to counter my expected adjustment\n   - Given they just played scissors successfully, they might anticipate I'll now avoid paper\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 rounds: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They've played paper 5 times in a row now\n   - This is a very strong commitment to paper strategy\n\n3. Examine their behavior after losses:\n   - They've now lost with paper twice to my scissors (rounds 7 and 9)\n   - Previously, when they lost multiple times with scissors, they eventually switched to paper\n   - They might finally switch away from paper after these repeated losses\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning:\n   - They might realize their paper strategy is being exploited by my scissors\n   - They could switch to rock to counter my scissors pattern\n   - They might return to their original scissors preference\n   - Or they could stubbornly stick with paper one more time\n\n5. Predict their next move based on adaptation patterns:\n   - Early game: They stuck with scissors until I countered it consistently\n   - Mid game: They switched to paper and had some success\n   - Now: After losing with paper twice to scissors, they're likely to adapt again\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they stick with paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm back to even score, so I can take some calculated risks\n   - Given their adaptation history, they're likely to switch from paper after two losses\n   - Rock seems most probable as their counter to my scissors success\n   - Paper gives me the maximum reward (+3) if they do switch to rock\n   - This is a good spot to go for the high-value play\n\n[move] paper"

Examine their commitment to paper:\n   - They're showing extreme persistence with paper strategy\n   - Even after clear losses to scissors, they continue with paper\n   - This suggests either a very stubborn strategy or they're trying to outlast my adaptations\n\n4. Consider what this tells me about their mindset:\n   - They might be committed to paper regardless of short-term losses\n   - They could be expecting me to eventually move away from scissors\n   - They might be playing a longer-term strategy of wearing down my adaptations\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - Given 6 straight papers, they might finally switch (adaptation pressure)\n   - Or they might stick with paper if they think I'll move away from scissors\n   - If they switch, rock would counter my expected scissors, scissors would counter my expected paper\n\n6. Evaluate the situation:\n   - Their paper obsession is clear and consistent\n   - Scissors has beaten their paper twice when I've used it\n   - They seem reluctant to abandon paper despite evidence it's not working against scissors\n\n7.

Analyze opponent's extended scissors streak:\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times in a row (rounds 14-17)\n   - Despite losing to rock in round 16, they didn't switch to paper\n   - This is different from their earlier adaptation pattern\n\n3. Examine their behavior change:\n   - Early game: They did switch from scissors to paper when rock repeatedly beat scissors\n   - Now: They're persisting with scissors even after losing to rock\n   - They might be trying a different strategy or have become more stubborn\n\n4. Consider what the tie might mean to them:\n   - The tie in round 17 might reinforce their scissors choice\n   - They avoided losing, which could encourage them to continue\n   - Or they might see it as a signal to finally switch\n\n5. Look at their commitment patterns:\n   - When they commit to a strategy, they tend to stick with it for multiple rounds\n   - They played scissors extensively early, then paper for 6 rounds\n   - Now they're in another scissors streak (4 rounds)\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with scissors: Following their commitment pattern, especially after the tie\n   - Switch to rock: To counter my expected scissors continuation\n   - Switch to paper: Their historical counter to rock, but they didn't switch after losing to rock\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - Given their persistence with scissors and the tie reinforcing their choice, they'll likely continue with scissors\n   - Rock is the best counter to exploit their scissors commitment\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's remarkable scissors streak:\n   - They've now played scissors 5 times in a row (rounds 14-18)\n   - They've lost to rock in rounds 16 and 18, but haven't switched\n   - This is unprecedented persistence compared to their earlier behavior\n\n3. Examine their adaptation breaking point:\n   - Early game: They switched from scissors to paper after 2-3 rock defeats\n   - Current: They've now lost to rock twice in this streak and haven't switched\n   - They seem much more committed to scissors than before\n\n4. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be trying to outlast my rock strategy\n   - They could be expecting me to switch away from rock eventually\n   - They might be stuck in a scissors commitment and unable to adapt\n   - The one tie (round 17) might be giving them hope\n\n5. Look at the pressure to adapt:\n   - They're clearly losing the scissors vs rock matchup repeatedly\n   - Normal game theory would suggest switching to paper to counter rock\n   - But they're showing unusual persistence\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with scissors: Extreme commitment, but losing repeatedly\n   - Switch to paper: Logical counter to rock, matches their historical pattern\n   - Switch to rock: To mirror my successful strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock wins (+1) - exploit their persistence\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their adaptation\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3) - highest reward but less likely\n   - Given their extreme scissors persistence (5 rounds), they might finally break and switch to paper as their historical counter to rock\n   - But their stubbornness suggests they might play scissors one more time\n   - This is a critical decision point - I think they'll finally adapt to paper\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze their adaptation pattern:\n   - They finally switched from scissors to paper after 5 consecutive scissors (rounds 14-18)\n   - This matches their historical pattern: when rock repeatedly beats scissors, switch to paper\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors in round 19\n\n3. Examine their switching behavior after losses:\n   - When they lose with a new strategy, they sometimes switch quickly\n   - Or they might commit to the new strategy for multiple rounds\n   - Their paper just lost to scissors, similar to how scissors was losing to rock\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning now:\n   - Paper just lost to scissors, so they might switch again\n   - They could return to scissors (their comfort zone)\n   - They might try rock to counter my scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper for a few rounds like they did before\n\n5. Look at their commitment patterns:\n   - Early scissors phase: Multiple rounds\n   - Middle paper phase: 6 consecutive rounds  \n   - Recent scissors phase: 5 consecutive rounds\n   - New paper phase: Just started, might continue despite the loss\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Stay with paper: Following their pattern of committing to new strategies\n   - Switch to rock: To counter my successful scissors\n   - Return to scissors: Back to their original preference\n   - Given their tendency to commit to strategies for multiple rounds, and they just switched to paper, they might stick with it\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stay with paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)  \n   - If they return to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Their historical pattern suggests they'll commit to paper for several rounds, even after a loss\n   - Scissors is the optimal counter to exploit their expected paper commitment\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze their recent rapid switching:\n   - scissors (5 rounds) \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They're now switching after each loss instead of committing to strategies\n   - This is a major change from their earlier long commitment phases\n\n3. Examine their new adaptation pattern:\n   - Round 19: Lost with paper to scissors \u2192 switched to rock\n   - Round 20: Won with rock against scissors\n   - They're now adapting immediately after losses and finding success\n\n4. Consider their evolved strategy:\n   - They seem to have learned that long commitments get exploited\n   - They're now playing more reactively and adaptively\n   - They successfully countered my scissors with rock\n\n5.

Predict their next move:\n   - Stay with rock: Exploit their successful counter to scissors\n   - Switch to paper: If they expect me to switch to paper to counter rock\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely since rock is working\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Given their new rapid adaptation style and rock's recent success, they might stick with rock briefly\n   - But they also might expect me to counter with paper\n   - Paper gives me the highest reward (+3) if they stick with rock, and it's a reasonable gamble given their success with rock\n\n[move] paper"

Look at their switching patterns after big losses:\n   - Earlier, when they lost -3 (rock vs paper in round 6), they adapted quickly\n   - Big losses seem to trigger immediate strategy changes for them\n   - They'll likely switch to counter my expected paper continuation\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Switch to scissors: Logical counter to paper, fits their rapid adaptation\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n   - Stay with rock: Very unlikely after the -3 loss\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1), Paper ties (0), Rock loses (-3)\n   - If they somehow stay with rock: Paper wins (+3), but very unlikely\n   - Given the severe -3 penalty they just took, they'll almost certainly switch to scissors to counter my paper\n   - Rock is the optimal counter to beat their expected scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Consider what this reveals about their strategy:\n   - They might be reverting to their old pattern of committing to strategies\n   - The tie in round 22 might encourage them to continue with rock\n   - They could be trying to outlast my adaptations again\n\n5. Look at their behavior after ties:\n   - Historically, ties sometimes encourage them to stick with their current choice\n   - They might see the tie as better than the loss and continue with rock\n   - Or they might finally switch after 3 rounds of rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their commitment pattern, especially after the tie\n   - Switch to paper: To counter my expected rock continuation\n   - Switch to scissors: Less likely given their current rock commitment\n\n7.

Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be completely stuck on rock strategy\n   - They could be expecting me to eventually switch away from paper\n   - They might be playing some kind of long-term psychological game\n   - Or they're simply not adapting to the clear losing pattern\n\n5. Look at breaking points:\n   - Even in their most committed phases before, they eventually adapted\n   - Two -3 losses should be a massive signal to switch\n   - But they're showing unprecedented stubbornness\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - Continue with rock: Following their extreme commitment despite losses\n   - Finally switch to scissors: To counter my paper after massive penalties\n   - Switch to paper: Mirror my successful strategy\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins (+3) - exploit their persistence\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins (+1) - counter their adaptation\n   - If they switch to paper: Scissors wins (+1) - counter their mirroring\n   - Given their extraordinary 4-round rock commitment despite -6 points in losses, they might incredibly continue with rock\n   - However, the pain threshold might finally be reached\n   - This is a critical decision point - they SHOULD switch, but their behavior suggests they might not\n   - I'll exploit their rock obsession one more time\n\n[move] paper"
