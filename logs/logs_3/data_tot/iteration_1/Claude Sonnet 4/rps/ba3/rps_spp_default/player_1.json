    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This makes paper a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they're probably going to make a somewhat random choice. In this case, I should consider:\n\n1. If they play rock (common first choice for new players), I win big with paper (+3)\n2. If they play paper, I lose small with scissors (-1) \n3. If they play scissors, I lose small with paper (-3)\n\nGiven that rock is often a default choice for new players, and the huge payoff advantage of paper beating rock, I'll take the calculated risk.\n\n[move] Paper - Taking advantage of the high payoff for beating rock, which new players often choose first."

My opponent finally adapted exactly as I predicted. After losing to my scissors three times with paper, they switched to rock to counter my scissors pattern - but I anticipated this and played paper for the maximum payoff.\n\nNow they know:\n- I can predict their adaptations\n- I successfully counter-counter-predicted them  \n- They're in a difficult strategic position\n\nFor round 12, they're likely thinking:\n1. \"They predicted my rock adaptation\"\n2. \"They might expect me to go back to paper\"\n3. \"Or they might expect me to try scissors\"\n\nThis is getting into deep psychological territory. They might:\n- Return to paper (their comfort zone, despite losses)\n- Try scissors (to counter my successful paper)\n- Stick with rock (doubling down on the adaptation)\n- Play randomly to break the pattern\n\nGiven that I just won big with paper vs their rock, they'll likely want to counter paper. The natural counter to paper is scissors.\n\nBut they also know I can predict their moves, so they might try to think one level deeper. However, after being outmaneuvered, they might go with the straightforward counter.\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting they'll play scissors to counter my successful paper from last round."
