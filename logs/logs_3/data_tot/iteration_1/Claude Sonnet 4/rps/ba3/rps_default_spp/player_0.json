    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They really do love that high-reward move, and it just paid off big for them.\n\nI'm noticing they have a strong tendency to return to paper after various situations - it's clearly their preferred move when in doubt. Even after losing with paper multiple times, they keep going back to it because of that +3 potential.\n\nThey just got a big +3 win with paper. Now they might:\n1. Try paper again (since it just worked)\n2. Switch to scissors (expecting me to counter-paper with scissors)\n3. Go to rock (if they think I'll stick with rock)\n\nGiven that paper just gave them a big win, and considering their historical love for paper, there's a decent chance they'll try it again. However, they might also expect me to counter with scissors.\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors (to beat their potentially repeated paper), they'd choose rock.\n\nBut honestly, their attachment to paper has been so consistent throughout this game that I think there's still a good chance they'll go for it again.\n\nI'll stick with scissors to beat paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

They haven't repeated the \"scissors after scissors tie\" move since rounds 7-8.\n\nGiven that we just had another scissors tie, and they've tried paper and rock after previous scissors ties (both losing), they might:\n1. Go back to paper (their favorite)\n2. Try rock again \n3.
