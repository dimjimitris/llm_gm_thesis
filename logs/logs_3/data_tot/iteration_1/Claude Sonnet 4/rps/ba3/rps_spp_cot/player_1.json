    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties: 0 points for both players\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest payoff differential (3 points vs 1 point for other winning moves)\n   - This creates an asymmetric game where paper wins are most valuable\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I need to consider common beginner tendencies\n\n3. Common beginner patterns:\n   - Many new players start with rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n   - Some might choose randomly without strategy\n   - They likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure yet\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If the opponent plays rock (common for beginners), I want to play paper for the +3 point advantage\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point with paper\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie with 0 points\n   - Paper seems like the optimal choice against an unknown fresh player\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Best case: +3 points (if they play rock)\n   - Worst case: -1 point (if they play scissors)\n   - Neutral case: 0 points (if they play paper)\n   - The potential reward outweighs the risk\n\n[move] Paper - maximizing expected value against a fresh player who might default to rock"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're not a complete beginner who defaults to rock\n   - They either analyzed the payoff structure similarly to me, or made a coincidental good choice\n   - They might be thinking about the high-value paper vs rock matchup too\n\n3.

Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stay with paper): I should stay with paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (trying to counter paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5.
