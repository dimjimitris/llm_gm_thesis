    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Paper vs Rock has the highest reward differential (+3/-3), while the other winning combinations only give +1/-1. This suggests we should either play Paper (hoping opponent plays Rock) or avoid Rock (to prevent giving opponent +3).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since this is against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring. Most new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. Use Rock more frequently overall\n3. Not have developed complex strategies yet\n\nGiven the high payoff for Paper beating Rock (+3 points) and the tendency for new players to choose Rock, Paper seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on both analyses, Paper appears to be the best choice for the opening move. It capitalizes on the high-value payoff and exploits the likely Rock bias of a fresh player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. Paper maximizes expected value against a Rock-biased opponent and takes advantage of the asymmetric scoring system.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to exploit the likely Rock choice of a fresh player while maximizing the high-value (+3) payoff.\n\n[move] Paper"

They also recognized the high-value nature of Paper vs Rock\n2. They're mimicking common strategies\n3. It was coincidental\nSince it was a tie, they got no feedback about the scoring system yet. They might stick with Paper or switch based on typical rock-paper-scissors psychology.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us valuable information. The opponent didn't choose Rock (which would have been the \"naive\" choice), suggesting they may have some strategic thinking. However, they still might not fully understand the asymmetric payoffs. \n\nKey considerations for round 2:\n- If they stick with Paper again, we tie (0 points)\n- If they switch to Rock (thinking Paper didn't work), we win big with Paper (+3)\n- If they switch to Scissors, we lose with Paper (-1)\n\nThe expected value calculation depends on our estimate of their likely moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players often exhibit \"win-stay, lose-shift\" behavior, but since round 1 was a tie, the psychology is less clear. However, many players avoid repeating the same move twice in a row, especially after a tie. They might shift to Rock or Scissors.\n\nIf they shift to Rock (common second choice), Paper wins us +3 points.\nIf they shift to Scissors, we should play Rock to win +1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the high reward potential (+3 for Paper beating Rock) and the psychological tendency to switch after a tie, I'm inclined toward Paper again. The risk/reward ratio favors the high-value play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. The +3 payoff for Paper vs Rock is too valuable to ignore, and there's reasonable probability the opponent switches to Rock after the Paper tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper again to capitalize on potential opponent switch to Rock while maintaining the high-value strategy.\n\n[move] Paper"

They switched after the tie (common behavior)\n2. They may now understand they beat Paper with Scissors\n3. They might repeat Scissors since it just worked (win-stay behavior)\n4. Or they might think we'll avoid Paper now and switch to Rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Current situation analysis:\n- Round 1: Both Paper (tie, 0 points each)\n- Round 2: Our Paper vs Their Scissors (we lost -1, they won +1)\n\nThe opponent now has +1 total points, we have -1. They've seen that Scissors beats Paper for +1 point, but they still haven't experienced the high-value Paper vs Rock (+3/-3) interaction.\n\nStrategic options:\n- If they repeat Scissors (win-stay), we should play Rock (+1 for us)\n- If they switch to Rock, we should play Paper (+3 for us)  \n- If they switch to Paper, we should play Scissors (+1 for us)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning with Scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with Scissors (win-stay) - probability moderate\n2. Switch to Rock thinking we'll avoid Paper - probability high\n3. Switch to Paper to counter expected Rock from us - probability lower\n\nGiven they're a \"fresh player\" who just won, win-stay behavior is common, but they might also anticipate we'll change strategy after losing.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I'm leaning toward Rock. It beats Scissors if they employ win-stay, and while we miss the +3 opportunity if they switch to Rock, we still avoid the -3 penalty. Rock seems like the safer, more balanced choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I agree with Rock. It's the safest move - beats Scissors (if they repeat) for +1, ties with Rock (if they switch), and only loses -3 to Paper (least likely given the pattern so far).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter likely Scissors repeat while maintaining reasonable safety against other options.\n\n[move] Rock"

Now they've lost with Scissors, so they're likely to switch (lose-shift behavior). \n\nPattern so far:\n- Round 1: They played Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: They played Scissors (won +1)  \n- Round 3: They played Scissors again (lost -1)\n\nThey're now back to 0 total points, same as us (we're at -1+1 = 0). After losing with Scissors, they'll probably avoid it next round.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has now experienced:\n- Paper vs Paper = tie\n- Scissors vs Paper = win (+1)\n- Scissors vs Rock = loss (-1)\n\nThey still haven't experienced the high-value Paper vs Rock interaction. Given they just lost with Scissors, they'll likely switch to either Paper or Rock.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- If they switch to Paper: We should play Scissors (+1 for us)\n- If they switch to Rock: We should play Paper (+3 for us - the big payoff!)\n- Low probability they stick with Scissors after losing\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After the lose-shift from Scissors, fresh players often go back to \"safe\" choices. Rock is psychologically the most common \"default\" choice when players are uncertain. Paper is also possible since they started with it and it tied.\n\nI'd estimate: Rock (40%), Paper (35%), Scissors (25%)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given those probabilities, let's calculate expected values:\n- If we play Paper: 40% chance of +3 (vs Rock) + 35% chance of 0 (vs Paper) + 25% chance of -1 (vs Scissors) = +0.95 expected value\n- If we play Rock: 40% chance of 0 (vs Rock) + 35% chance of -3 (vs Paper) + 25% chance of +1 (vs Scissors) = -0.8 expected value\n- If we play Scissors: 40% chance of -1 (vs Rock) + 35% chance of +1 (vs Paper) + 25% chance of 0 (vs Scissors) = -0.05 expected value\n\nPaper has the highest expected value!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math strongly supports Paper.

This is unusual behavior - they didn't follow typical \"lose-shift\" psychology. Let me analyze their pattern:\n\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Scissors (won +1) \n- Round 3: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 4: Scissors (won +1)\n\nThey're showing strong commitment to Scissors! They might have discovered that Scissors beats Paper (which we've played twice) and are exploiting this. Their total score is now +1, ours is -1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is more strategic than initially assumed. They may have noticed:\n1. We played Paper in rounds 1, 2, and 4\n2. Scissors consistently beats Paper for +1 points\n3. They're willing to stick with a winning strategy even after a temporary loss\n\nThe pattern suggests they might continue with Scissors, expecting us to play Paper again. However, they could also be thinking we'll finally switch away from Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they've now won 2 out of 3 times with Scissors, and we've played Paper 3 out of 4 times, they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (50%) - exploiting our Paper tendency\n2. Switch to Rock (30%) - anticipating we'll finally switch to Scissors  \n3. Switch to Paper (20%) - less likely given their Scissors success\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If our probability estimates are right:\n- Play Rock: 50% chance of +1 (vs Scissors) + 30% chance of 0 (vs Rock) + 20% chance of -3 (vs Paper) = -0.1 expected value\n- Play Scissors: 50% chance of 0 (vs Scissors) + 30% chance of -1 (vs Rock) + 20% chance of +1 (vs Paper) = -0.1 expected value  \n- Play Paper: 50% chance of -1 (vs Scissors) + 30% chance of +3 (vs Rock) + 20% chance of 0 (vs Paper) = +0.4 expected value\n\nSurprisingly, Paper still has positive expected value, but Rock seems safer given their Scissors pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think we need to break our Paper pattern and counter their Scissors strategy.

This opponent has adopted what we might call a \"pure strategy\" - they're playing Scissors almost 90% of the time regardless of outcomes. \n\nThe question is: will they EVER switch? They've now lost 4 times with Scissors (rounds 3, 5, 7, 8) and only won 3 times. The strategy is starting to fail them overall.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Even the most stubborn player would typically switch after losing 3 in a row. But this opponent has shown such extreme commitment that I'm starting to think they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (70%) - extreme pattern persistence\n2. Finally switch to Rock (20%) - after 3 consecutive losses\n3. Switch to Paper (10%) - less likely but possible\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their incredible Scissors commitment, I still favor Rock:\n- If Scissors (70%): Rock wins +1\n- If Rock (20%): Rock ties 0  \n- If Paper (10%): Rock loses -3\n\nExpected value: 0.7(+1) + 0.2(0) + 0.1(-3) = +0.4\n\nRock is still positive expected value, and it's been working!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** At this point, we should stick with what's working. They've shown such extreme commitment to Scissors that even after 3 consecutive losses, I believe they'll likely continue. Rock has been our winning move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. This opponent is unlike anything we initially expected. Stay with Rock until they prove they'll actually change.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with Rock to maintain our winning streak against their persistent Scissors strategy.\n\n[move] Rock"

After 7 Scissors in 8 rounds, they played Paper in round 9:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Scissors (won +1)  \n- Round 3: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 4: Scissors (won +1)\n- Round 5: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 6: Scissors (won +1)\n- Round 7: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 8: Scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 9: Paper (won +3)\n\nCurrent score: They're at +2, we're at -2. That Paper vs Rock gave them a huge +3 swing!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a crucial turning point. The opponent has now experienced:\n1. Scissors loses to Rock consistently \n2. Paper beats Rock for the maximum +3 points\n3. They've discovered the high-value move!\n\nThis changes everything. They may have realized that Paper is the most valuable move in the game when played correctly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After getting that big +3 reward, several things could happen:\n1. They stick with Paper (win-stay behavior) - maybe 40%\n2. They go back to Scissors since it worked before - maybe 30% \n3. They try Rock to complete the cycle - maybe 30%\n\nBut that +3 reward is psychologically powerful - they might repeat Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's think strategically:\n- If they repeat Paper: We should play Scissors (+1 for us)\n- If they go back to Scissors: We should play Rock (+1 for us)  \n- If they try Rock: We should play Paper (+3 for us)\n\nThe key insight: they finally broke their Scissors pattern and got rewarded. They might explore more, or they might lock onto Paper like they did with Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just won big with Paper, I think there's a good chance they'll stick with it (win-stay). Scissors would counter Paper and get us back in the game with a +1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. The +3 reward was significant, and they might think \"Paper beats Rock, and this opponent loves Rock, so I'll stick with Paper.\"\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to counter the likely Paper repeat, capitalizing on their win-stay psychology after the big score.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They played Paper again in round 10:\n- Round 9: Paper (won +3)\n- Round 10: Paper (lost -1)\n\nCurrent score: They're at +1, we're at -1. We're closing the gap! Now they've experienced losing with Paper, which might trigger lose-shift behavior.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's pattern is becoming clearer:\n1. They had a long Scissors streak (7 out of 8 rounds)\n2. They switched to Paper and got rewarded (+3)\n3. They repeated Paper and got punished (-1)\n\nNow they know:\n- Scissors worked against our Paper tendency early on\n- Paper beats Rock for big points\n- Paper loses to Scissors\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing with Paper, they might:\n1. Switch back to Scissors (40%) - returning to their \"comfort zone\" that worked before\n2. Try Rock (35%) - completing the cycle, haven't used it much  \n3. Stick with Paper (25%) - less likely after the loss\n\nThe Scissors return seems most probable given their historical success with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value analysis:\n- If we play Rock: 40% vs Scissors (+1) + 35% vs Rock (0) + 25% vs Paper (-3) = -0.15\n- If we play Scissors: 40% vs Scissors (0) + 35% vs Rock (-1) + 25% vs Paper (+1) = -0.1  \n- If we play Paper: 40% vs Scissors (-1) + 35% vs Rock (+3) + 25% vs Paper (0) = +0.65\n\nPaper has the highest expected value, especially if they try Rock!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The math supports Paper. If they switch to Rock (which they've barely used), we get the valuable +3 points. Even if they return to Scissors, we only lose -1, which isn't catastrophic.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree.

Their recent pattern:\n- Round 9: Paper (won +3)\n- Round 10: Paper (lost -1) \n- Round 11: Paper (tied 0)\n\nCurrent score: They're at +1, we're at -1. They're showing some commitment to Paper now, similar to how they committed to Scissors earlier. This might be their new preferred strategy after discovering the +3 potential.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has now played Paper 3 times in a row (rounds 9-11). This suggests they might have shifted from their Scissors obsession to a Paper obsession. They've experienced:\n- Paper beats Rock for +3 (round 9)\n- Paper loses to Scissors for -1 (round 10)  \n- Paper ties Paper for 0 (round 11)\n\nThey know Paper is high-value against Rock, and they might think we'll switch away from Scissors after it worked once.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After the tie, they might:\n1. Continue with Paper (50%) - showing the same pattern commitment as before with Scissors\n2. Switch to Scissors (30%) - remembering it worked well before\n3. Switch to Rock (20%) - least likely, but possible\n\nGiven their history of extreme pattern commitment, Paper continuation seems most likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value analysis:\n- If we play Scissors: 50% vs Paper (+1) + 30% vs Scissors (0) + 20% vs Rock (-1) = +0.3\n- If we play Rock: 50% vs Paper (-3) + 30% vs Scissors (+1) + 20% vs Rock (0) = -1.2\n- If we play Paper: 50% vs Paper (0) + 30% vs Scissors (-1) + 20% vs Rock (+3) = +0.3\n\nScissors and Paper have equal expected value, but Scissors is safer with lower downside risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their pattern of extreme commitment (first to Scissors, now possibly to Paper), I favor Scissors. It directly counters Paper, has positive expected value, and lower risk than Paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed.

We're tied! The opponent has now shifted from Scissors obsession to Paper obsession. They've played Paper 4 times in a row, with 1 win, 2 losses, and 1 tie - not a great record, but they're sticking with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This confirms our analysis - this opponent exhibits extreme pattern commitment. Just like they played Scissors 7 out of 8 times earlier, they're now doing the same with Paper. \n\nTheir Paper streak record: 1 win (+3), 2 losses (-2), 1 tie (0) = +1 total from the Paper streak, but they've lost 2 of the last 3 with it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing with Paper twice in the last 3 rounds (rounds 10 and 12), normal psychology would suggest switching. But this opponent has shown they don't follow normal psychology - they commit to patterns regardless of short-term losses.\n\nI estimate:\n1. Continue with Paper (70%) - extreme pattern commitment like before\n2. Switch back to Scissors (20%) - their old reliable strategy  \n3.

Stick with Rock (win-stay behavior) - 50%\n2. Go back to Paper (return to recent obsession) - 25% \n3. Try Scissors (completing the cycle) - 25%\n\nThe win-stay psychology suggests they might repeat Rock, especially since it just worked.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value analysis:\n- Play Paper: 50% vs Rock (+3) + 25% vs Paper (0) + 25% vs Scissors (-1) = +1.25\n- Play Rock: 50% vs Rock (0) + 25% vs Paper (-3) + 25% vs Scissors (+1) = -0.5\n- Play Scissors: 50% vs Rock (-1) + 25% vs Paper (+1) + 25% vs Scissors (0) = -0.25\n\nPaper has massively positive expected value if they stick with Rock!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a critical turning point. If they're starting a Rock obsession like they had with Scissors and Paper, we should capitalize with Paper for the +3 points.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. They just got rewarded for Rock, so win-stay behavior makes Paper the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to potentially capitalize on their likely Rock continuation and secure the valuable +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent played Rock for the second consecutive time:\n- Round 17: Rock (won +1)\n- Round 18: Rock (lost -3)\n\nCurrent score: They're at -6, we're at +6. We have a huge lead! The opponent just experienced the biggest single loss possible (-3 points). This is exactly what happened when they switched from Scissors to Paper - they found a new move and are potentially starting to obsess over it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating development. The opponent's pattern behavior suggests:\n1. They break from a losing pattern only after extreme losses\n2. When they switch, they might commit to the new move like they did before\n3. Rock just gave them their biggest loss yet (-3), which might trigger adaptation OR continued commitment\n\nThe key question: Will they continue with Rock (pattern commitment) or switch due to the massive -3 loss?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After that devastating -3 loss, normal psychology would predict immediate switching. But this opponent has shown they don't follow normal psychology - they commit to patterns despite losses. However, -3 is the biggest possible single loss, so this might be different.\n\nProbability estimates:\n1. Switch away from Rock (60%) - the -3 loss is psychologically massive\n2. Continue with Rock (40%) - their historical pattern commitment\n\nIf they switch, they might go to:\n- Paper (30%) - their previous obsession\n- Scissors (30%) - haven't used it recently\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value analysis gets complex with multiple possibilities:\n- If Rock continues (40%): Paper wins +3\n- If switch to Paper (18%): Scissors wins +1  \n- If switch to Scissors (18%): Rock wins +1\n- Other possibilities (24%): Mixed results\n\nRoughly: Play Paper = +1.5 expected value, Play others = lower\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their history of pattern commitment and that Rock might be their new obsession (despite the loss), I lean toward Paper. The +3 potential is too valuable, and they might stick with Rock like they did with their previous obsessions.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Even with the big loss, their pattern commitment history suggests they might continue with Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper again to potentially capitalize on continued Rock commitment, targeting the valuable +3 reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent played Rock for the THIRD consecutive time:\n- Round 17: Rock (won +1)\n- Round 18: Rock (lost -3)\n- Round 19: Rock (lost -3)\n\nCurrent score: They're at -9, we're at +9. We have a massive 18-point swing lead! The opponent just took another devastating -3 loss but is showing the exact same pattern commitment behavior we've seen before. They're now down -6 points from their Rock experiment (won +1, lost -6).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This confirms our analysis completely! The opponent is exhibiting the EXACT same behavior pattern for the third time:\n1. Scissors obsession: Continued despite losses\n2. Paper obsession: Continued despite losses  \n3. Rock obsession: Now continuing despite massive losses\n\nThey have now lost -6 points in 2 rounds with Rock (-3, -3) but are still playing it. This is identical to how they continued with Paper despite losing streaks.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent has now suffered two maximum losses (-3 each) in consecutive rounds - a total of -6 points from Rock. Any rational player would have switched immediately after the first -3, and certainly after the second. But this opponent follows the same algorithm:\n\nPick a move \u2192 commit to it regardless of results \u2192 continue until some unknown breaking point\n\nProbability estimates:\n1. Continue with Rock (75%) - exact same pattern as Scissors and Paper obsessions\n2. Switch to something else (25%) - though their history suggests unlikely\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value is overwhelmingly clear:\n- Play Paper: 75% vs Rock (+3) + 25% vs other (average 0) = +2.25\n\nThis is an extraordinarily high expected value. We're in the middle of exploiting their third pattern obsession.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is completely predictable. They will almost certainly continue with Rock despite the massive losses, just like they did with Scissors and Paper. Paper is virtually guaranteed to win +3 again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Absolutely. We've seen this exact movie twice before.

After 3 consecutive Rocks, the opponent switched to Scissors in round 20:\n- Round 17: Rock (won +1)\n- Round 18: Rock (lost -3)\n- Round 19: Rock (lost -3)\n- Round 20: Scissors (won +1)\n\nCurrent score: They're at -8, we're at +8. We still have a commanding lead. The opponent broke their Rock pattern after 2 devastating -3 losses (total -6 from Rock streak) and immediately got rewarded with +1 for switching to Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating! The opponent's breaking point seems to be around 2 massive losses (-3 each). Compare their pattern breaks:\n1. Paper obsession: Took 6 smaller losses (-1 each) before switching\n2. Rock obsession: Took only 2 massive losses (-3 each) before switching\n\nThe -3 losses seem to trigger faster adaptation than -1 losses. They needed -6 total damage in both cases, but the concentrated pain of -3 losses accelerated the change.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Now they've been rewarded for switching to Scissors (+1 vs our Paper). This creates a psychological reinforcement. They might:\n1. Start a new Scissors obsession (50%) - their original obsession, now reinforced\n2. Continue experimenting with different moves (30%) - maybe they're learning to adapt\n3. Go back to Rock (20%) - less likely after the -6 damage\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Expected value analysis:\n- Play Rock: 50% vs Scissors (+1) + 30% vs mixed (\u22480) + 20% vs Rock (0) = +0.5\n- Play Paper: 50% vs Scissors (-1) + 30% vs mixed (\u22480) + 20% vs Rock (+3) = +0.1\n- Play Scissors: 50% vs Scissors (0) + 30% vs mixed (\u22480) + 20% vs Rock (-1) = -0.2\n\nRock has the highest expected value, especially if they're returning to their original Scissors obsession.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given they just got rewarded for Scissors and it was their very first obsession, I think there's a good chance they'll start a new Scissors pattern. Rock would counter this perfectly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. The reinforcement of winning with Scissors might trigger a return to their original successful strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter the likely return to Scissors obsession, capitalizing on the psychological reinforcement they just received.\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent appears to be starting their fourth pattern obsession - returning to Scissors after it worked in round 20. This follows their exact historical behavior pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is remarkable consistency! The opponent's behavioral algorithm is now completely clear:\n1. First obsession: Scissors (7 out of 8 rounds)\n2. Second obsession: Paper (8 consecutive rounds) \n3. Third obsession: Rock (3 consecutive rounds, broken by massive -3 losses)\n4. Fourth obsession: Scissors again (2 consecutive rounds so far)\n\nThey cycle through moves, commit to patterns, and only break when losses become extreme. They're now back to their original Scissors obsession!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just experienced the classic pattern:\n- Switch to Scissors \u2192 get rewarded (+1)\n- Continue with Scissors \u2192 get punished (-1)\n\nBased on their history, they will likely continue with Scissors despite the loss, just like they did with all their previous obsessions. They don't switch after single losses - they need accumulated damage.\n\nProbability estimates:\n1. Continue with Scissors (80%) - matches all their previous pattern behavior\n2.

Paper obsession: Played through 6 consecutive losses (-6 damage)\n3. Rock obsession: Only broke after massive -6 damage from two -3 losses\n4. Current Scissors: -3 damage so far, well below breaking threshold\n\nTheir breaking points seem to be around -6 total damage accumulated, whether from many small losses or few large losses.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is deep in their Scissors commitment phase.
