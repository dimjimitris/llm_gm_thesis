    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - If I can predict my opponent will play rock, paper is extremely valuable\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), rock is often the most intuitive first choice\n\n4. Reasoning for first move:\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems \"strong\"\n   - Paper would counter this perfectly and give me +3 points\n   - Even if wrong, the risk assessment favors this high-reward play\n\n5.

Consider what happens after they lose:\n   - After losing with scissors (round 9), they switched to paper (round 10)\n   - Now after losing with paper, what will they do?\n   - Historical pattern: they often switch moves after losses\n\n5. Evaluate options for round 11:\n   - If they switch to rock (countering my winning scissors): paper wins (+3 points - big reward!)\n   - If they repeat paper: scissors wins again (+1 point)\n   - If they go to scissors: rock wins (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm on a winning streak and gaining confidence\n   - They just lost with paper and might switch to rock\n   - Paper offers the highest reward (+3) and could capitalize on this momentum\n   - After two consecutive wins, taking a calculated high-risk, high-reward play makes sense\n\n[move] paper"

Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has historically been good at predicting when I'll repeat moves\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper after it finally didn't lose\n   - Scissors has been my most reliable move throughout this game\n   - Return to my proven strategy - scissors has never failed me\n   - Even if they expect it, scissors gives me the best odds of success\n\n[move] scissors"

Update my excellent recent record:\n   - Rounds 1-20: -8 points total\n   - Round 21: scissors vs paper (won +1 point)\n   - Current score: -7 points total\n   - I've now won 3 out of the last 4 rounds!\n\n2. Analyze my incredible scissors performance:\n   - Scissors: 4 wins, 6 ties, 0 losses (10 plays) - absolutely perfect record!\n   - Scissors has now won me 4 points and never lost me any\n   - This confirms scissors is by far my best strategy\n\n3. Observe the recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: scissors beat paper (+1) \n   - Round 20: paper tied paper (0)\n   - Round 21: scissors beat paper (+1)\n   - I'm clearly finding my rhythm\n\n4. Note opponent's behavior:\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 20-21)\n   - Both times I either tied or beat them\n   - They might be getting predictable or frustrated\n\n5. Consider their likely response:\n   - After losing with paper again, they might switch to rock or scissors\n   - They could try rock to finally counter my successful scissors strategy\n   - Or they might go back to scissors (their own previously safe choice)\n\n6. Evaluate my options for round 22:\n   - If opponent plays rock (to counter my scissors): paper wins +3 (huge gain!)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: tie (maintains progress)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins +1 (continuing the streak)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm riding high on momentum and the opponent seems to be struggling\n   - They might finally try rock to stop my scissors dominance\n   - Paper could give me the big +3 breakthrough I need\n   - With my score improving from -10 to -7, a +3 win would get me to -4\n   - This feels like the right moment to capitalize on their likely counter-move\n\n[move] paper"

Update my dramatically improved record:\n   - Rounds 1-21: -7 points total\n   - Round 22: paper vs rock (won +3 points)\n   - Current score: -4 points total\n   - I've improved from -10 to -4 in just 5 rounds!\n\n2. Celebrate this breakthrough:\n   - My first successful paper play - finally beat something other than scissors!\n   - +3 points is the maximum possible gain per round\n   - I correctly predicted the opponent would try rock to counter my scissors dominance\n   - Four wins in the last 5 rounds - incredible turnaround!\n\n3. Analyze my recent hot streak:\n   - Round 18: rock beat scissors (+1)\n   - Round 19: scissors beat paper (+1)\n   - Round 20: paper tied paper (0)\n   - Round 21: scissors beat paper (+1)\n   - Round 22: paper beat rock (+3)\n   - Total: +6 points in 5 rounds!\n\n4. Review my updated move statistics:\n   - Scissors: 4 wins, 6 ties, 0 losses (10 plays) - still perfect\n   - Paper: 1 win, 1 tie, 4 losses (6 plays) - finally got a win!\n   - Rock: 1 win, 3 losses (4 plays) - limited success\n\n5. Consider opponent's state:\n   - They just took a -3 point hit (maximum penalty)\n   - They tried to counter my scissors strategy and failed badly\n   - They might be frustrated or desperate now\n\n6. Evaluate their likely response:\n   - After the big loss with rock, they might avoid it\n   - They could go back to paper or scissors\n   - They might try to counter my successful paper with scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm riding massive momentum with 4 wins in 5 rounds\n   - The opponent is likely rattled after the -3 loss\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper after such a big win\n   - But scissors has been my most consistent weapon throughout\n   - Return to my proven champion move - scissors has never let me down\n   - Even if they predict it, scissors gives me the best chance of continued success\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "A tie with scissors - back to the familiar pattern, but that's still better than losing points.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Update my record:\n   - Rounds 1-22: -4 points total\n   - Round 23: scissors-scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current score: -4 points total\n   - Still maintaining my improved position\n\n2. Analyze my scissors performance:\n   - Scissors: 4 wins, 7 ties, 0 losses (11 plays) - still absolutely perfect\n   - Even with the tie, scissors continues to be my most reliable move\n   - No other move comes close to this consistency\n\n3. Review the momentum:\n   - I've gone from -10 to -4 in recent rounds\n   - Won 4 out of the last 6 rounds (with 1 tie, 1 tie)\n   - This tie doesn't break my positive momentum\n\n4. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They just took a brutal -3 loss in round 22\n   - Now they're playing it safe with scissors too\n   - They might be in damage control mode like I was earlier\n\n5. Analyze the current dynamic:\n   - Both players have returned to scissors as the \"safe\" choice\n   - We might be entering another tie pattern\n   - But ties are much better for me now at -4 than they were at -10\n\n6. Evaluate my options for round 24:\n   - The opponent might stick with scissors again (another tie)\n   - They could try rock to break the scissors pattern\n   - Or they might switch to paper\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - At -4 points, I'm in a much better position than before\n   - I don't need to take huge risks anymore\n   - Scissors has been my lifeline throughout this entire game\n   - The opponent just got burned badly with rock, so they might avoid it\n   - Even if we tie again, maintaining -4 is acceptable\n   - Stay with my proven, undefeated strategy\n\n[move] scissors"
