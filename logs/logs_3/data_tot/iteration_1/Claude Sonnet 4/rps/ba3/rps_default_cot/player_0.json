    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

But they could also double down on paper since it's been their most successful move overall.\n\nLooking at recent patterns after losses, they tend to switch moves rather than repeat. After losing in round 7 with rock, they played paper. So they might switch from paper to either scissors or rock.\n\nI think rock is a solid choice here - it beats scissors if they try to counter my previous scissors, and while it loses to paper, they might be less likely to repeat paper immediately after it just lost.\n\n[move] rock"

They continue to outplay me at every turn.\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\n- Round 2: They played scissors, I played rock (I won +1)\n- Round 3: They played paper, I played scissors (I won +1) \n- Round 4: They played scissors, I played rock (I won +1)\n- Round 5: They played paper, I played scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 6: They played paper, I played rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 7: They played rock, I played scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 8: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\n- Round 9: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\n- Round 10: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\n- Round 11: They played rock, I played rock (tie)\n- Round 12: They played paper, I played scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 13: They played scissors, I played rock (I won +1)\n- Round 14: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\n- Round 15: They played paper, I played rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 16: They played rock, I played scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 17: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\n- Round 18: They played rock, I played rock (tie)\n- Round 19: They played rock, I played scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 20: They played scissors, I played paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 21: They played paper, I played rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 22: They played rock, I played scissors (I lost -1)\n\nThey perfectly anticipated my scissors play again! Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They're cycling through all moves but timing them perfectly to counter my choices.\n\nCurrent distribution:\n- Paper: 10 times\n- Scissors: 7 times\n- Rock: 6 times\n\nAt this point, I need to acknowledge that this opponent has completely figured out my thought patterns. Every time I try to counter-predict, they're one step ahead. I've lost 6 of the last 7 rounds.\n\nMaybe I need to stop overthinking entirely and just pick something without elaborate reasoning. They seem to be reading my logical approach too well.\n\nAfter using rock successfully again, they might expect me to play paper to beat rock. Or they might go back to their statistical favorite of paper.\n\nI'm going to try a different approach - just pick the move that gives me the best risk/reward without overthinking their counter-strategy. Paper gives +3 against rock, loses -1 to scissors. Rock gives +1 against scissors, loses -3 to paper.\n\nI'll go with paper and hope they either repeat rock or play scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

They continue to read me perfectly.\n\nUpdated sequence shows they just played scissors after rock, and I fell into their trap again by playing paper.\n\nCurrent distribution after 23 rounds:\n- Paper: 10 times (theirs)\n- Scissors: 8 times (theirs)\n- Rock: 6 times (theirs)\n\nI'm getting completely outplayed. Every strategic approach I've tried - pattern recognition, counter-prediction, risk analysis - they've anticipated and countered. I've now lost 7 of the last 8 rounds.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to abandon all complex reasoning and just make a simple, direct choice. They're clearly an expert at reading my thought processes.\n\nTheir recent moves have been rock \u2192 scissors. If I stop trying to be clever and just play the basic counter to their most recent move (scissors), that would be rock.\n\nRock beats scissors for +1, ties with rock for 0, and loses to paper for -3. It's a straightforward play without overthinking.\n\nI'm going to stop trying to predict their predictions and just play rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock"
