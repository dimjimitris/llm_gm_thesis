Continue with scissors (establishing a new pattern)\n2. Go back to paper (their historical favorite)\n3. Try rock (least used, might be due)\n\nGiven that they just repeated scissors and we tied (which is better than losing for them), they might stick with it again. But they could also think I'll expect scissors and switch to counter it.\n\nIf they play scissors again, rock beats it. If they switch to paper, I lose -3, but if they try rock, we tie.

Review what happened:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This tells me the opponent also recognized paper's high-value potential or made the same strategic choice\n\n2. Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - Not completely random - they chose the strategically strong paper option\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about maximizing the 3-point opportunity\n   - Could indicate they understand the payoff structure\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (avoided a loss)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll change my strategy\n   - They could try scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: I lose 1 point  \n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors to counter\n   - If they stick with paper again, scissors gives me a win\n   - Scissors counters the paper strategy while avoiding the high-loss risk of playing rock against paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper while positioning myself well if they try to counter my previous paper play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Decision reasoning:\n   - If they're mirroring and play what I play: tie (no harm)\n   - If they're anticipating my move and play scissors to beat expected paper: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they go back to any other pattern: rock has decent coverage\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially counter their anticipated scissors play, or to break any mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the most recent pattern:\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Current total: 0 points\n\n2. Confirm the mirroring pattern:\n   - The opponent is now clearly mirroring my moves exactly\n   - 4 consecutive rounds where they played exactly what I played\n   - This is no longer coincidence - it's a deliberate strategy\n\n3. Understand the opponent's new strategy:\n   - They've switched from alternating patterns to perfect mirroring\n   - This guarantees ties (0 points) for both players\n   - They might be trying to neutralize the game or force me to make the first strategic mistake\n\n4. Analyze the mirroring trap:\n   - If I continue any predictable strategy, they'll mirror it\n   - Every round will be a tie unless one of us breaks the pattern\n   - The question is: how do I break this without giving them an advantage?\n\n5. Consider counter-strategies:\n   - I need to play something they can't mirror (impossible - they see my move after I make it)\n   - I need to predict when they might break their mirroring strategy\n   - I could try to exploit their mirroring by playing moves that would be bad for them to mirror\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they're committed to mirroring, I should play the move that, if mirrored, puts us both in the best neutral position\n   - However, they might break mirroring when they realize it's not winning them points\n   - If they break mirroring, they might try to counter what they expect me to play\n\n7. Meta-game decision:\n   - Since mirroring guarantees ties, they might eventually try to break it\n   - If they break it, they might anticipate I'll continue with a pattern\n   - I should play something different from my recent moves to throw them off\n   - Since I've played paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, scissors would complete a cycle but might be expected\n\n8. Final strategic choice:\n   - If they continue mirroring: tie (neutral)\n   - If they break mirroring and expect me to play scissors: they might play rock, so I should play paper\n   - Paper also gives the highest reward (+3) if they happen to play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to either tie (if they mirror) or potentially win big if they break mirroring and play rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current total: -1 points\n   - The opponent BROKE their mirroring strategy!\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - Started with rock-scissors alternating pattern (rounds 2-7)\n   - Broke into mirroring strategy (rounds 8-11)\n   - Now broke mirroring to play scissors against my paper\n\n3.

Consider what they might expect from me now:\n   - I've lost twice in a row, putting me at -2 points\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and make emotional decisions\n   - They could anticipate I'll try rock (to beat their previous scissors) or paper (high-value move)\n   - Or they might think I'll try to be unpredictable\n\n5.

Evaluate the current game state:\n   - I'm down 2 points and need to recover\n   - The tie stopped my losing streak, which is positive\n   - The opponent seems less certain in their predictions now\n\n5.

Analyze the recent turnaround:\n   - I've recovered from -2 to +1 points with that big win\n   - The opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock again\n\n3. Examine opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - This looks like a return to alternating, but between scissors and rock only\n   - If this pattern continues, next move should be scissors\n\n4. Compare to their earlier behavior:\n   - They originally alternated rock-scissors (rounds 2-7)\n   - Switched to mirroring (rounds 8-11)\n   - Tried counter-prediction (rounds 12-13)\n   - Now back to scissors-rock alternating (rounds 12-15)\n\n5.

Confirm the opponent's alternating pattern:\n   - Opponent's sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - The scissors-rock alternation is now confirmed over 5 moves\n   - They've returned to a predictable alternating strategy\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - Following the pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Next move should be rock\n   - This pattern has been consistent since round 12\n\n4. Analyze my strategic position:\n   - I'm now ahead +2 points - a good lead\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds by correctly predicting their pattern\n   - The opponent seems locked into this alternating strategy\n\n5. Plan my counter-move:\n   - If opponent plays rock (as pattern suggests): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - This would bring me to +5 points, a commanding lead\n   - Alternative outcomes:\n     - If they play scissors: I lose 1 point (paper vs scissors, +1 total)\n     - If they play paper: tie (0 points, maintain +2 lead)\n\n6. Consider the risk-reward:\n   - +3 reward for paper vs rock is the highest possible\n   - Pattern confidence is very high (5 consecutive alternations)\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable given my lead\n   - This could secure a decisive advantage\n\n7. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent appears to be sticking with simple alternation\n   - They may not realize I've figured out their pattern\n   - Taking advantage of predictable opponents is key to winning\n   - Building a larger lead reduces pressure for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the predicted rock move and maximize my points advantage.\n\n[move] paper",

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: +2 points\n   - The opponent BROKE their scissors-rock alternating pattern again!\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's latest sequence:\n   - Previous pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Expected: rock (to continue alternation)\n   - Actual: paper (broke the pattern)\n   - They've now switched strategies again\n\n3. Examine opponent's strategic evolution throughout the game:\n   - Phase 1: Rock-scissors alternation (rounds 2-7)\n   - Phase 2: Mirroring my moves (rounds 8-11)  \n   - Phase 3: Counter-prediction attempts (rounds 12-13)\n   - Phase 4: Scissors-rock alternation (rounds 12-15)\n   - Phase 5: Now playing paper (round 17)\n\n4. Consider why they played paper:\n   - They might have realized I was predicting their alternating pattern\n   - They could be trying to counter my expected paper play\n   - They may be testing a new strategy or going random\n   - Paper is a strong strategic choice (high reward potential)\n\n5. Evaluate their likely mindset:\n   - They've broken patterns before when I started predicting them\n   - They seem adaptive and willing to change strategies\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper or switch strategies\n   - The tie might make them think I'm also being unpredictable now\n\n6. Consider their next move options:\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper: they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch: they might try to predict what I'll switch to\n   - They could continue with paper or start a new pattern\n   - They might go fully random to avoid being predicted\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +2 points, so I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable, making pattern recognition harder\n   - I should focus on moves that have good general properties rather than specific predictions\n   - Rock has decent coverage: beats scissors (+1), ties with rock (0), loses to paper (-3)\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Since they just played paper, they might not immediately repeat it\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they repeat it (+1)\n   - But if they expect me to play scissors, they might counter with rock\n   - Rock seems like a balanced choice with moderate upside and limited catastrophic downside\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as a balanced choice that works well against scissors and ties against rock, while avoiding the high-risk paper vs scissors matchup.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze opponent's latest moves:\n   - Recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played all three moves in succession: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This looks like they might be cycling through all options\n\n3. Examine the potential new pattern:\n   - If they're doing a complete cycle: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 (scissors?)\n   - This would be a rock-paper-scissors rotation pattern\n   - Next move would be scissors if this pattern holds\n\n4. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - They keep changing strategies when I start predicting them\n   - Now they might be using a full rotation to be less predictable\n   - A complete cycle is harder to exploit than simple alternation\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm ahead +2 points - maintaining a good lead\n   - Two consecutive ties suggest we're both being more cautious\n   - I can afford to take some calculated risks to extend my lead\n\n6. Plan my response if they play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (completing the cycle): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - This would bring me to +3 points, a strong lead\n   - Alternative outcomes:\n     - If they play rock: tie (0 points, maintain +2 lead)\n     - If they play paper: I lose 3 points (rock vs paper, -1 total)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern makes logical sense\n   - +1 reward is solid for maintaining/building my lead\n   - Rock has good defensive properties even if the pattern breaks\n   - Pattern recognition has worked well for me in this game\n\n8.

Continue being predictable\n\nSince they're clearly expecting me to counter their rock with paper, and they've been getting me with these predictions, maybe they'll play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\nBut I could also just play rock - it ties with rock if they repeat, beats scissors if they counter my expected paper, and only loses to paper.\n\nI'll try rock and hope to at least avoid another big loss.\n\n[move] rock",
