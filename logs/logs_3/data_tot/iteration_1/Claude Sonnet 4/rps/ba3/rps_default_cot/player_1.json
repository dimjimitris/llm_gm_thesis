    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest stakes (3 points vs 1 point for other winning moves)\n   - This makes the rock-paper interaction most critical\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may choose randomly or go with common first choices\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for new players (it's the first mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win 3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk (-1)\n   - The high reward potential outweighs the moderate risk\n   - Against a fresh player who might favor rock, paper gives me the best expected value\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on the high-value win condition and the likelihood that a new player might choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - Not completely random - they chose the strategically strong paper option\n   - They might be thinking similarly to me about maximizing the 3-point opportunity\n   - Could indicate they understand the payoff structure\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (avoided a loss)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll change my strategy\n   - They could try scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win 1 point\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: I lose 1 point  \n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors to counter\n   - If they stick with paper again, scissors gives me a win\n   - Scissors counters the paper strategy while avoiding the high-loss risk of playing rock against paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper while positioning myself well if they try to counter my previous paper play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might have predicted I'd switch from paper to scissors\n   - Or they're following a pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?\n   - Rock is a safe middle-ground choice (beats scissors, loses to paper moderately)\n\n4.

Analyze opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Original alternating pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Then broke pattern: paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now abandoned the strict alternating pattern completely\n\n3. Look for new patterns:\n   - Last 3 moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This could be a new pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors (full cycle)\n   - If continuing this cycle, next move would be rock\n\n4. Consider opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - They started with alternating rock-scissors (predictable)\n   - Switched to paper when I caught on\n   - Now played scissors (completing rock-paper-scissors cycle?)\n   - They seem to be adapting and becoming less predictable\n\n5. Evaluate my options for next move:\n   - If they play rock (completing the cycle): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can recognize and break patterns\n   - They might be testing a new rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - Given their recent moves (paper \u2192 scissors), rock would complete the cycle\n   - The +3 payoff for paper vs rock is worth the risk\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm at 0 points, so I need to start building a lead\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable (-1 vs scissors)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting they'll complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle with rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 4 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After breaking the original alternating pattern, they've played: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This suggests they might be mirroring me or following my lead\n\n3. Look for new patterns in opponent's play:\n   - They played paper when I played paper (rounds 8 and 10)\n   - They played scissors when I played scissors (round 9)\n   - Are they copying my moves?

Test the mirroring hypothesis:\n   - Round 8: I played paper, they played paper \u2713\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played scissors \u2713\n   - Round 10: I played paper, they played paper \u2713\n   - This could be coincidence or they're now mirroring my strategy\n\n5. Strategic implications if they're mirroring:\n   - If they copy my move, every round will be a tie (0 points)\n   - I need to break this pattern to score points\n   - The question is: what would beat what I'm \"supposed\" to play?\n\n6. Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - If they expect me to play paper again (since I've played it twice recently), they might play scissors to beat it\n   - Alternatively, if they're truly mirroring, they'll play whatever I play\n   - I should play something that beats what they might expect me to play\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - If they're mirroring and play what I play: tie (no harm)\n   - If they're anticipating my move and play scissors to beat expected paper: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they go back to any other pattern: rock has decent coverage\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially counter their anticipated scissors play, or to break any mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

Confirm the mirroring pattern:\n   - The opponent is now clearly mirroring my moves exactly\n   - 4 consecutive rounds where they played exactly what I played\n   - This is no longer coincidence - it's a deliberate strategy\n\n3. Understand the opponent's new strategy:\n   - They've switched from alternating patterns to perfect mirroring\n   - This guarantees ties (0 points) for both players\n   - They might be trying to neutralize the game or force me to make the first strategic mistake\n\n4. Analyze the mirroring trap:\n   - If I continue any predictable strategy, they'll mirror it\n   - Every round will be a tie unless one of us breaks the pattern\n   - The question is: how do I break this without giving them an advantage?\n\n5. Consider counter-strategies:\n   - I need to play something they can't mirror (impossible - they see my move after I make it)\n   - I need to predict when they might break their mirroring strategy\n   - I could try to exploit their mirroring by playing moves that would be bad for them to mirror\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they're committed to mirroring, I should play the move that, if mirrored, puts us both in the best neutral position\n   - However, they might break mirroring when they realize it's not winning them points\n   - If they break mirroring, they might try to counter what they expect me to play\n\n7. Meta-game decision:\n   - Since mirroring guarantees ties, they might eventually try to break it\n   - If they break it, they might anticipate I'll continue with a pattern\n   - I should play something different from my recent moves to throw them off\n   - Since I've played paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, scissors would complete a cycle but might be expected\n\n8. Final strategic choice:\n   - If they continue mirroring: tie (neutral)\n   - If they break mirroring and expect me to play scissors: they might play rock, so I should play paper\n   - Paper also gives the highest reward (+3) if they happen to play rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to either tie (if they mirror) or potentially win big if they break mirroring and play rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider what they might expect from me now:\n   - I've lost twice in a row, putting me at -2 points\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and make emotional decisions\n   - They could anticipate I'll try rock (to beat their previous scissors) or paper (high-value move)\n   - Or they might think I'll try to be unpredictable\n\n5.

Compare to their earlier behavior:\n   - They originally alternated rock-scissors (rounds 2-7)\n   - Switched to mirroring (rounds 8-11)\n   - Tried counter-prediction (rounds 12-13)\n   - Now back to scissors-rock alternating (rounds 12-15)\n\n5.

Analyze the opponent's latest sequence:\n   - Previous pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Expected: rock (to continue alternation)\n   - Actual: paper (broke the pattern)\n   - They've now switched strategies again\n\n3.

Consider why they played paper:\n   - They might have realized I was predicting their alternating pattern\n   - They could be trying to counter my expected paper play\n   - They may be testing a new strategy or going random\n   - Paper is a strong strategic choice (high reward potential)\n\n5. Evaluate their likely mindset:\n   - They've broken patterns before when I started predicting them\n   - They seem adaptive and willing to change strategies\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper or switch strategies\n   - The tie might make them think I'm also being unpredictable now\n\n6. Consider their next move options:\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper: they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch: they might try to predict what I'll switch to\n   - They could continue with paper or start a new pattern\n   - They might go fully random to avoid being predicted\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +2 points, so I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable, making pattern recognition harder\n   - I should focus on moves that have good general properties rather than specific predictions\n   - Rock has decent coverage: beats scissors (+1), ties with rock (0), loses to paper (-3)\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - Since they just played paper, they might not immediately repeat it\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they repeat it (+1)\n   - But if they expect me to play scissors, they might counter with rock\n   - Rock seems like a balanced choice with moderate upside and limited catastrophic downside\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock as a balanced choice that works well against scissors and ties against rock, while avoiding the high-risk paper vs scissors matchup.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the recent results:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: +2 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's latest moves:\n   - Recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played all three moves in succession: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This looks like they might be cycling through all options\n\n3. Examine the potential new pattern:\n   - If they're doing a complete cycle: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 (scissors?)\n   - This would be a rock-paper-scissors rotation pattern\n   - Next move would be scissors if this pattern holds\n\n4. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - They keep changing strategies when I start predicting them\n   - Now they might be using a full rotation to be less predictable\n   - A complete cycle is harder to exploit than simple alternation\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm ahead +2 points - maintaining a good lead\n   - Two consecutive ties suggest we're both being more cautious\n   - I can afford to take some calculated risks to extend my lead\n\n6. Plan my response if they play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (completing the cycle): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - This would bring me to +3 points, a strong lead\n   - Alternative outcomes:\n     - If they play rock: tie (0 points, maintain +2 lead)\n     - If they play paper: I lose 3 points (rock vs paper, -1 total)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - The scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern makes logical sense\n   - +1 reward is solid for maintaining/building my lead\n   - Rock has good defensive properties even if the pattern breaks\n   - Pattern recognition has worked well for me in this game\n\n8. Strategic confidence:\n   - The opponent has shown they follow patterns until I catch on\n   - This new pattern is fresh and they might stick with it for a few rounds\n   - Taking advantage of patterns has been my most successful strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter the predicted scissors move in their potential rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n[move] rock"
