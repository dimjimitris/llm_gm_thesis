    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move: Rock gives +3 points when it wins (beating paper), which is the highest possible reward in the game.\n\n3. Consider the risks: Rock loses to scissors (-1 point), but the potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1) by a significant margin.\n\n4. Factor in opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Many beginners tend to choose rock or scissors as their first instinct.\n\n5. Calculate expected value: Even if there's only a moderate chance my opponent chooses paper, the 3:1 reward ratio makes rock mathematically favorable compared to other moves that only offer +1 when winning.\n\n6. Make the strategic choice: Rock offers the best risk-reward ratio and highest potential payoff.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I should play rock to maximize my potential points.\n\n[move] rock"

This means my opponent lost -3 points.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology after a loss: My opponent just suffered the maximum possible penalty (-3). They might:\n   - Switch strategies to avoid paper\n   - Try to counter my rock with scissors\n   - Stick with paper thinking I won't use rock again\n\n3. Evaluate my options against likely opponent responses:\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (to beat rock): I should play rock again (+1 if I play scissors to beat their scissors, but 0 if tie)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (copying my winning move): Playing paper gives me +1, playing scissors gives tie\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: Rock gives me another +3\n\n4. Consider the meta-game: The opponent might expect me to change my strategy after winning, so they might not expect rock again.\n\n5. Assess risk-reward: Rock still offers the highest potential reward (+3), and even if opponent chooses scissors to counter, I only lose -1, which is still better than the -3 penalty other moves can incur.\n\n6. Factor in unpredictability: Since this opponent is \"fresh,\" their response patterns are hard to predict, making the high-reward rock still attractive.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock remains the highest value play, and the opponent's reaction is unpredictable enough that I should stick with the mathematically superior option.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the recent shift:\n   - Early-mid game: Heavy scissors preference\n   - Recent rounds: More rock usage\n   - They seem to be adapting to counter my rock-heavy strategy\n   - Last 4 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n\n4. Recognize opponent adaptation:\n   - They may have realized I frequently play rock (6 out of 9 rounds)\n   - Playing rock themselves forces ties instead of letting me win\n   - This is a defensive strategy to minimize their losses\n\n5. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - High probability: Rock (continuing recent trend, defensive strategy)\n   - Medium probability: Scissors (returning to their earlier preference)\n   - Low probability: Paper (still rarely used)\n\n6. Evaluate counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3 - maximum reward!)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: They've played rock 3 times in a row, suggesting they're committed to this defensive strategy. Paper offers maximum reward against this likely continuation and good coverage overall.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper counters their defensive rock strategy for maximum points while maintaining good overall coverage.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I rock, opponent paper \u2192 I win +3\n   - Round 2: I rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I lose -1\n   - Round 3: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 4: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie 0\n   - Round 5: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 6: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie 0\n   - Round 7: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie 0\n   - Round 8: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 9: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie 0\n   - Round 10: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 11: I rock, opponent paper \u2192 I win +3\n   - Round 12: I rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I lose -1\n   - Round 13: I rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I lose -1\n   - Round 14: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 15: I rock, opponent scissors \u2192 I lose -1\n   - Round 16: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Round 17: I paper, opponent scissors \u2192 I win +1\n   - Current total: +9 points\n\n2. Opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 11 out of 17 rounds (64.7%)\n   - Rock: 4 out of 17 rounds (23.5%)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 17 rounds (11.8%)\n\n3. Observe the opponent's incredible scissors fixation:\n   - They've now played scissors 6 rounds in a row (rounds 12-17)\n   - Their scissors rate has increased to 64.7%\n   - This is now an extreme pattern\n\n4. Confirm the perfect correlation:\n   - Every time I play paper, opponent plays scissors (7 out of 7 times now)\n   - This is a 100% reliable pattern\n   - I win +1 every single time with this combination\n\n5. Evaluate any reason to change strategy:\n   - My paper beats their scissors consistently\n   - I'm winning +1 per round when I play paper\n   - There's no indication they will change from scissors\n   - Changing my strategy would likely reduce my winnings\n\n6. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They may be stuck in a pattern or have a strong preference for scissors\n   - They may not be adapting strategically\n   - They continue playing scissors even though it loses to my paper\n\n7. Strategic decision: The pattern is crystal clear and profitable. With a 100% success rate when I play paper against their scissors, and their 64.7% scissors rate (6 in a row), continuing with paper is the optimal strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper maintains my perfect winning streak against their scissors addiction.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 18: I paper, opponent rock \u2192 I lose -3 points\n   - This breaks their 6-round scissors streak\n   - This breaks my perfect paper-beats-scissors pattern\n   - I suffered the maximum penalty (-3 points)\n\n2. Update the complete game history:\n   - Current total: +9 - 3 = +6 points\n   - Opponent's updated frequency:\n     - Scissors: 11 out of 18 rounds (61.1%)\n     - Rock: 5 out of 18 rounds (27.8%)\n     - Paper: 2 out of 18 rounds (11.1%)\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - They finally broke their scissors pattern after 6 consecutive rounds\n   - They switched to rock, which beats paper for maximum damage (-3 to me)\n   - This suggests they may have been waiting for the right moment to counter my paper strategy\n\n4. Evaluate opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They may have noticed my recent paper streak (3 rounds in a row)\n   - They switched to rock to counter my paper for maximum points (+3 for them)\n   - They might continue with rock or return to scissors\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Medium-high probability: Rock (just worked successfully, maximum reward)\n   - Medium probability: Scissors (their historical preference, 61% overall)\n   - Lower probability: Paper (least used move)\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-options:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3 - maximum reward!)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 - maximum reward!)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given that rock just gave them maximum reward, they might repeat it. However, they also might return to their scissors comfort zone. Rock gives me +1 against scissors and +3 against paper, while paper gives me +3 against rock. Since rock just worked for them, I'll counter with paper for the maximum reward potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper counters their successful rock play for maximum recovery points.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 19: I paper, opponent rock \u2192 I lose -3 points\n   - They played rock again, beating my paper for maximum damage\n   - Current total: +6 - 3 = +3 points\n   - I've now lost -6 points in the last 2 rounds\n\n2. Update opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 11 out of 19 rounds (57.9%)\n   - Rock: 6 out of 19 rounds (31.6%)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 19 rounds (10.5%)\n\n3. Identify the critical pattern shift:\n   - Opponent played scissors for 6 straight rounds (rounds 12-17)\n   - Then switched to rock for 2 straight rounds (rounds 18-19)\n   - They've successfully countered my paper strategy twice in a row\n   - This shows they can adapt and exploit my predictable moves\n\n4. Analyze opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Mixed play with scissors preference\n   - Mid game: Heavy scissors streak (exploiting my rock preference)\n   - Recent: Rock streak (exploiting my paper response)\n   - They're showing pattern recognition and counter-adaptation\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - High probability: Rock (working successfully, 2 in a row)\n   - They're getting maximum reward (+3) from rock vs my paper\n   - They might continue this profitable strategy\n   - Or they might return to scissors if they think I'll switch from paper\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3) - but I just tried this twice and lost\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n\n7. Strategic decision: They're clearly on a rock streak to counter my paper. I need to break this cycle. Since rock beats paper, I should play scissors to beat their rock. Wait - let me double-check the rules: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point.\" Yes, scissors beats rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors beats their rock streak and stops my massive point losses.\n\n[move] scissors"

Update opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 11 out of 20 rounds (55%)\n   - Rock: 7 out of 20 rounds (35%)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 20 rounds (10%)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's current pattern:\n   - They've now played rock 3 times in a row (rounds 18-20)\n   - This suggests they may be locked into rock strategy\n   - Rock gave them maximum rewards against my paper (+3 twice)\n   - But now my scissors beat their rock\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely response:\n   - They might continue with rock (if they're committed to this strategy)\n   - They might switch back to scissors (their historical preference at 55%)\n   - They might try paper to counter if they expect me to play scissors again\n   - After losing to my scissors, they may adapt\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If opponent continues rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 for me) \n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 for me - maximum reward!)\n\n6. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - They just lost after a successful 2-round rock streak\n   - They might abandon rock since it just failed\n   - They might return to their comfort zone (scissors)\n   - Or try paper as a counter-move\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given their historical 55% scissors preference and the fact that rock just failed them, they're likely to either return to scissors or try paper. Rock gives me good coverage: +1 vs scissors, +3 vs paper, and only loses to rock (which just failed for them).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock provides excellent coverage against their likely switch away from the failed rock strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's commitment to rock:\n   - 4 consecutive rock plays shows strong commitment to this strategy\n   - Even after losing to my scissors, they stuck with rock\n   - This suggests they may be very predictable or stubborn with rock\n   - Rock is now their second most frequent move at 38.1%\n\n4.
