Identify the highest reward move: Rock gives +3 points when it wins (beating paper), which is the highest possible reward in the game.\n\n3. Consider the risks: Rock loses to scissors (-1 point), but the potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1) by a significant margin.\n\n4. Factor in opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Many beginners tend to choose rock or scissors as their first instinct.\n\n5. Calculate expected value: Even if there's only a moderate chance my opponent chooses paper, the 3:1 reward ratio makes rock mathematically favorable compared to other moves that only offer +1 when winning.\n\n6.

They might:\n   - Switch strategies to avoid paper\n   - Try to counter my rock with scissors\n   - Stick with paper thinking I won't use rock again\n\n3. Evaluate my options against likely opponent responses:\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (to beat rock): I should play rock again (+1 if I play scissors to beat their scissors, but 0 if tie)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (copying my winning move): Playing paper gives me +1, playing scissors gives tie\n   - If opponent sticks with paper: Rock gives me another +3\n\n4. Consider the meta-game: The opponent might expect me to change my strategy after winning, so they might not expect rock again.\n\n5. Assess risk-reward: Rock still offers the highest potential reward (+3), and even if opponent chooses scissors to counter, I only lose -1, which is still better than the -3 penalty other moves can incur.\n\n6. Factor in unpredictability: Since this opponent is \"fresh,\" their response patterns are hard to predict, making the high-reward rock still attractive.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock remains the highest value play, and the opponent's reaction is unpredictable enough that I should stick with the mathematically superior option.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's reactive strategy:\n   - When I play rock repeatedly, they switch to rock (defensive ties)\n   - When I play paper, they consistently counter with scissors\n   - They're showing predictable counter-play patterns\n\n5.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I broke their pattern by playing rock when they expected scissors\n   - Instead, they played paper (which loses to rock for maximum penalty -3)\n   - This suggests they might be trying to counter-counter my strategy\n\n4. Examine their adaptation patterns:\n   - They had been reliably countering my paper with scissors\n   - When I switched to rock, they tried paper (perhaps expecting me to continue with rock)\n   - They're showing they can adapt, but sometimes guess wrong\n\n5. Predict their next move logic:\n   - They just took a -3 penalty, their worst possible loss\n   - They might switch back to scissors (their most frequent move)\n   - They might try rock to counter if they expect me to play rock again\n   - They might avoid paper since it just cost them heavily\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3 - maximum reward!)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 - maximum reward!)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning: After taking maximum damage (-3), they're likely to avoid paper and return to their comfort zone of scissors or try rock defensively.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 18: I paper, opponent rock \u2192 I lose -3 points\n   - This breaks their 6-round scissors streak\n   - This breaks my perfect paper-beats-scissors pattern\n   - I suffered the maximum penalty (-3 points)\n\n2. Update the complete game history:\n   - Current total: +9 - 3 = +6 points\n   - Opponent's updated frequency:\n     - Scissors: 11 out of 18 rounds (61.1%)\n     - Rock: 5 out of 18 rounds (27.8%)\n     - Paper: 2 out of 18 rounds (11.1%)\n\n3. Analyze the opponent's strategic shift:\n   - They finally broke their scissors pattern after 6 consecutive rounds\n   - They switched to rock, which beats paper for maximum damage (-3 to me)\n   - This suggests they may have been waiting for the right moment to counter my paper strategy\n\n4. Evaluate opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They may have noticed my recent paper streak (3 rounds in a row)\n   - They switched to rock to counter my paper for maximum points (+3 for them)\n   - They might continue with rock or return to scissors\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Medium-high probability: Rock (just worked successfully, maximum reward)\n   - Medium probability: Scissors (their historical preference, 61% overall)\n   - Lower probability: Paper (least used move)\n\n6.

Strategic decision: Given that rock just gave them maximum reward, they might repeat it. However, they also might return to their scissors comfort zone. Rock gives me +1 against scissors and +3 against paper, while paper gives me +3 against rock. Since rock just worked for them, I'll counter with paper for the maximum reward potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper counters their successful rock play for maximum recovery points.\n\n[move] paper"

Critical observation - opponent's scissors dominance:\n   - They've now played scissors 4 rounds in a row (rounds 12-15)\n   - Scissors is their overwhelming preference at 60%\n   - My prediction was correct, but my counter failed because I misunderstood the game rules\n\n4. Re-examine the game rules:\n   - \"rock beats paper\" - so rock wins against paper\n   - \"scissors beats rock\" - so scissors wins against rock\n   - \"paper beats scissors\" - so paper wins against scissors\n   - I've been playing correctly, but opponent is exploiting my rock preference\n\n5. Recognize the fundamental issue:\n   - Opponent has figured out that scissors is highly effective\n   - It beats my frequent rock plays\n   - When I switch to paper, they still play scissors (which loses to paper, giving me +1)\n   - But they immediately return to scissors\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Extremely high probability: Scissors (4 in a row, 60% overall rate)\n   - They're committed to this strategy\n   - It's working well against my mixed rock/paper approach\n\n7. Strategic decision: Since they're heavily committed to scissors, I need to consistently counter with paper. Paper beats scissors for +1. I should stop playing rock since scissors beats rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper beats their dominant scissors strategy and stops my losses from playing rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have predictable patterns\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (\"rock\" comes first in the name)\n\n4. Strategy considerations:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (high reward)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 points (low penalty)\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable balanced choice against an unknown opponent\n\n5. For the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the best risk/reward ratio - high upside if they choose the common \"rock\" default, and manageable downside if they choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's likely rock choice while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Brutal reality check:\n   - I'm down -9 points and have only won 1 round out of 11\n   - My pattern recognition and counter-adaptation strategies are failing\n   - The opponent is consistently outplaying me\n\n3. Opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock\n   - They've played: Rock 7 times, Paper 4 times, Scissors 0 times\n   - Rock is clearly their dominant strategy (64% of plays)\n\n4. Simple mathematical truth:\n   - If they play rock 64% of the time, scissors should be my best move\n   - Scissors vs Rock = +1 point (64% chance)\n   - Scissors vs Paper = -1 point (36% chance) \n   - Expected value: 0.64(+1) + 0.36(-1) = +0.28 points per round\n\n5. Stop overthinking and commit to the math:\n   - They favor rock significantly\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - I need to stop trying to outthink them and just play the percentages\n   - Even if they adapt, I need multiple wins to recover from -9\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors based on their clear rock preference and commit to the mathematical advantage.\n\n[move] scissors"

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have predictable patterns\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (\"rock\" comes first in the name)\n\n4. Strategy considerations:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (high reward)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 points (low penalty)\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable balanced choice against an unknown opponent\n\n5. For the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the best risk/reward ratio - high upside if they choose the common \"rock\" default, and manageable downside if they choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's likely rock choice while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] paper",

Exploit the predictable counter:\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they'll likely play scissors\n   - If I play rock against their expected scissors, I win +1\n   - This breaks their successful counter-pattern\n\n6. Consider meta-game psychology:\n   - They've successfully countered my last paper play\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies\n   - But their scissors-counters-paper pattern is very strong\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given their 100% rate of playing scissors when I play paper, and their overall 50% scissors frequency, rock is the optimal counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock exploits their predictable scissor-countering behavior and their overall scissors preference.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider the meta-game:\n   - They're locked into scissors because it's working\n   - If I can beat scissors consistently, they'll have to adapt\n   - Rock is the only move that beats scissors\n\n7. Strategic realization: The issue isn't my move choice (rock does beat scissors), but they might be reading my patterns. However, given their 60% scissors rate and 4 in a row, I should continue with rock but maybe they'll eventually have to switch.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. They're playing scissors because it beats both rock and paper. But rock should beat scissors. Let me check my logic...\n\nActually, I made an error. Let me recheck the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around!)\n- Rock beats scissors  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo when they play scissors and I play paper, I should win. Let me reread...\n\nActually, looking back at the results, when I played paper and they played scissors, I won +1 point. So paper does beat scissors. The issue is they're consistently playing scissors, so I should play paper to beat it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper beats scissors, and they're heavily favoring scissors (60%, 4 in a row).\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze opponent's rock commitment:\n   - They're showing extreme persistence with rock (4 straight rounds)\n   - Even after my scissors beat their rock in round 20, they continued\n   - This suggests either a very stubborn strategy or they're trying to outlast my counters\n   - Rock is now their second most frequent move at 38.1%\n\n4. Evaluate their strategic thinking:\n   - They may be committed to rock regardless of results\n   - They might expect me to change strategies after the tie\n   - They could be playing defensively (ties are better than losses)\n   - Or they're waiting for me to switch so rock can beat paper again\n\n5.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 23: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie, 0 points  \n   - They switched from scissors back to rock again\n   - Current total: +4 + 0 = +4 points\n   - This shows they're alternating between their two preferred moves\n\n2. Update opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 12 out of 23 rounds (52.2%)\n   - Rock: 9 out of 23 rounds (39.1%)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 23 rounds (8.7%)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent alternating pattern:\n   - Round 20: Rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 21: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 22: Scissors (tied with my scissors)\n   - Round 23: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - They're switching between rock and scissors\n\n4. Identify the emerging strategy:\n   - They seem to be alternating between their two most frequent moves\n   - Rock: 39.1% frequency\n   - Scissors: 52.2% frequency\n   - Paper remains rarely used at 8.7%\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move based on alternating pattern:\n   - If following the recent pattern: Should be scissors next (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ?)\n   - High probability: Scissors (fits alternating pattern, historically preferred)\n   - Medium probability: Rock (if they break the alternating pattern)\n   - Low probability: Paper (consistently rare)\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3 for me - maximum reward!)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 for me - maximum reward!)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Based on the alternating pattern and their scissors preference, scissors is most likely next. Rock is the optimal counter, giving me +1 against scissors and maximum rewards against their other possible moves.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock counters the expected scissors in their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 23: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n   - They switched back to rock after one round of scissors\n   - Current total: +4 + 0 = +4 points\n   - This shows they're alternating between rock and scissors recently\n\n2. Update opponent's move frequency:\n   - Scissors: 12 out of 23 rounds (52.2%)\n   - Rock: 9 out of 23 rounds (39.1%)\n   - Paper: 2 out of 23 rounds (8.7%)\n\n3. Analyze recent opponent pattern:\n   - Last 6 rounds: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They seem to heavily favor rock and scissors\n   - Paper remains very rare (only 8.7% overall)\n   - Rock is becoming increasingly frequent (39.1%)\n\n4. Identify the shifting dynamics:\n   - Early game: Scissors dominated\n   - Mid-late game: Rock becoming more prominent\n   - They're essentially playing a two-strategy game: scissors vs rock\n   - Very little paper usage throughout\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - High probability: Scissors (52.2% overall, alternating pattern suggests switch from rock)\n   - Medium-high probability: Rock (39.1% overall, just played it)\n   - Very low probability: Paper (only 8.7%, rarely used)\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent plays rock: Paper beats rock (+3 for me - maximum reward!)\n   - If opponent plays paper: Rock beats paper (+3 for me - maximum reward!)\n\n7. Strategic decision: The opponent seems to be alternating between rock and scissors. After playing rock, they might switch to scissors. Rock gives me +1 against scissors and maximum rewards against their other options. Given their low paper usage, rock provides the best expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock covers both of their primary strategies optimally, with strong expected value.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Round 23: I rock, opponent rock \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n   - They switched back to rock immediately after playing scissors\n   - Current total: +4 + 0 = +4 points\n   - They're showing rapid strategy switching\n\n2.

Analyze opponent's recent volatility:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Rock streak (4 rounds)\n   - Round 22: Switched to scissors\n   - Round 23: Switched back to rock\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more reactive\n\n4. Examine the shifting dynamics:\n   - They seem to be adapting more quickly now\n   - Less committed to long streaks\n   - Both scissors and rock are viable options for them\n   - Paper remains rarely used\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Medium-high probability: Scissors (overall preference at 52.2%)\n   - Medium probability: Rock (just played, 39.1% overall)\n   - They might continue alternating between these two\n   - Low probability: Paper (consistently avoided)\n\n6.

Strategic decision: With their increased volatility between scissors and rock, and given that they just played rock (which might make them switch to scissors), rock provides solid coverage. It beats their most likely move (scissors) and offers maximum rewards against other possibilities.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock maintains good coverage against their volatile scissors/rock switching pattern.\n\n[move] rock",
