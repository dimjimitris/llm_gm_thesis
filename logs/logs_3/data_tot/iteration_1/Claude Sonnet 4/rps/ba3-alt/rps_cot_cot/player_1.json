    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have predictable patterns\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (\"rock\" comes first in the name)\n\n4. Strategy considerations:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (high reward)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 points (low penalty)\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable balanced choice against an unknown opponent\n\n5. For the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the best risk/reward ratio - high upside if they choose the common \"rock\" default, and manageable downside if they choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's likely rock choice while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost -3 points\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won +1 point\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost -1 point\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie 0 points\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost -1 point\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie 0 points\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie 0 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost -1 point\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie 0 points\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost -1 point\n   - Current total: -6 points\n\n2. Critical observation - they may be reading MY patterns:\n   - Every single time I've played scissors recently (rounds 8 and 10), they played paper\n   - Every time I've played rock recently (rounds 6, 7, 9), they also played rock\n   - They might be adapting TO ME rather than following their own pattern\n\n3. Complete opponent sequence:\n   - Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper\n   - Recent trend: They're countering my moves effectively\n\n4. Strategic breakthrough - randomization might be key:\n   - If they're reading my patterns, I need to be unpredictable\n   - Paper is the move I've used least (only once in round 1)\n   - Paper beats scissors, loses to rock (-3), beats scissors (+1)\n   - Since they never play scissors, paper vs rock gives -3, paper vs paper gives 0\n\n5. But wait - let me think about their perspective:\n   - If they think I'll switch away from scissors (since it keeps losing), they might go back to rock\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play scissors\n   - But this is exactly the pattern thinking that's been failing me\n\n6. New approach - play what they haven't seen much from me:\n   - I've barely used paper (only round 1)\n   - If they're adapting to my recent scissors/rock pattern, paper might surprise them\n   - Even if it doesn't work, I need to break the current losing cycle\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to break my predictable pattern and try something they haven't seen from me recently.\n\n[move] paper"

Simple mathematical truth:\n   - If they play rock 64% of the time, scissors should be my best move\n   - Scissors vs Rock = +1 point (64% chance)\n   - Scissors vs Paper = -1 point (36% chance) \n   - Expected value: 0.64(+1) + 0.36(-1) = +0.28 points per round\n\n5. Stop overthinking and commit to the math:\n   - They favor rock significantly\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - I need to stop trying to outthink them and just play the percentages\n   - Even if they adapt, I need multiple wins to recover from -9\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors based on their clear rock preference and commit to the mathematical advantage.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated opponent sequence:\n   - Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Paper-Paper-Paper-Scissors-Rock\n   - Rock: 11 times, Paper: 9 times, Scissors: 1 time out of 21 rounds\n   - Recent sequence: Paper-Paper-Paper-Paper-Scissors-Rock\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've now used all three moves and seem to be adapting more dynamically\n   - After 4 papers, they tried scissors (to counter my rock), now back to rock\n   - This suggests they're testing different strategies rather than following fixed patterns\n   - Rock remains their most frequent choice overall (52%)\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - They may be becoming less predictable as they learn\n   - However, they still haven't established a consistent counter-strategy\n   - Their move distribution: Rock 52%, Paper 43%, Scissors 5%\n   - Scissors still beats rock and has positive expected value: 0.52(+1) + 0.43(-1) + 0.05(0) = +0.09\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - With their increased unpredictability, I should return to the mathematically sound approach\n   - Scissors beats their most common move (rock) and gives steady +1 gains\n   - Even with their recent adaptations, rock is still their plurality choice\n   - I need consistent gains rather than chasing high-risk/high-reward plays\n\nFinal decision: Return to scissors to exploit their continued rock preference while accepting they may be more adaptive now.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Interesting! They played scissors again - this is becoming a pattern.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the updated game history:\n   - Just tied with scissors vs their scissors (0 points)\n   - Current total: -4 + 0 = -4 points\n   - They've now played scissors twice in the last 3 rounds\n\n2. Updated opponent sequence:\n   - Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Paper-Paper-Paper-Scissors-Rock-Scissors\n   - Rock: 11 times, Paper: 9 times, Scissors: 2 times out of 22 rounds\n   - Recent sequence: Paper-Paper-Paper-Scissors-Rock-Scissors\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition:\n   - They're experimenting with scissors more frequently now\n   - Scissors appeared in rounds 20 and 22 (2 out of last 3 moves)\n   - This suggests they may be shifting toward scissors as a new strategy\n   - They might think I'll continue with rock (since it was working) and counter with scissors\n\n4. Strategic adaptation needed:\n   - If they're increasing scissors usage, I should play rock\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if they play paper, I lose -3 points (manageable given my recent gains)\n   - If they play rock, we tie (0 points)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Their recent scissors trend suggests they expect me to use rock or paper\n   - Rock counters scissors effectively and they seem to be leaning toward scissors\n   - Given their adaptive behavior, I should counter their apparent new preference\n   - Need to stay one step ahead of their learning curve\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their emerging scissors strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Just tied with rock vs their rock (0 points)\n   - Current total: -4 + 0 = -4 points\n   - Recent sequence from them: Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock\n\n2. Updated opponent sequence:\n   - Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Rock-Rock-Rock-Paper-Rock-Paper-Paper-Paper-Paper-Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock\n   - Rock: 12 times, Paper: 9 times, Scissors: 2 times out of 23 rounds\n   - Last 4 moves: Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock (alternating pattern)\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - They appear to be alternating between scissors and rock recently\n   - This could be a deliberate strategy or coincidence\n   - If the alternating continues, next should be scissors\n   - Rock still dominates their overall play (52%)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors next (following the alternating pattern), I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they break the pattern and play rock, we tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper, I lose (-3 points)\n   - The alternating pattern suggests scissors is most likely\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Their last 4 moves show Scissors-Rock-Scissors-Rock\n   - Following this pattern, scissors would be next\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty isn't catastrophic\n   - I need to capitalize on any discernible patterns\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to exploit the apparent scissors-rock alternating pattern.\n\n[move] rock"
