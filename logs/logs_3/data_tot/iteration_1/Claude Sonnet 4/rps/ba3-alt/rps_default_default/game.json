Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might make random moves or go with common first choices.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Paper also has a moderate risk profile - I win 1 point if they play Scissors, lose 3 points if they play Rock, and tie if they also play Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

My opponent has played rock twice in a row now after switching from scissors. This could be the beginning of another rock pattern (they previously did 5 rocks in a row), or they might switch soon. Given that I just beat their rock with scissors and they lost a point while I gained one, they might change strategies. However, their history shows they sometimes stick with patterns for several rounds even when being countered initially.\n\n[move] (Continuing to counter their apparent return to rock) scissors",
