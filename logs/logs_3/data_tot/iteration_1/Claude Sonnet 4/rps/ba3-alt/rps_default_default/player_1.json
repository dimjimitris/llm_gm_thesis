    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might make random moves or go with common first choices.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Paper also has a moderate risk profile - I win 1 point if they play Scissors, lose 3 points if they play Rock, and tie if they also play Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

This confirms that Rock is indeed a powerful move when it wins, but it also suggests my opponent might have a preference for Rock or was thinking strategically about the high-reward nature of that move.\n\nNow I need to decide my next move. If my opponent tends to favor Rock (either due to preference or because they saw it worked well), then I should play Scissors to counter it, which would give me +1 point. However, they might also anticipate that I'll try to counter their Rock, so they could switch to Paper.\n\nGiven that this is only the second round and I'm down 3 points, I should consider the risk-reward profile.

I had been thinking about this backwards. My opponent played Scissors for the fifth time, and my Paper beat it for +1 point.\n\nMy current total score is -1 point.\n\nThis changes everything about my strategy. My opponent's pattern: Rock(7 times), Paper(2 times), Scissors(5 times).\n\nIf they continue with Scissors (their current streak), then Paper would beat it again for +1 point.\n\nIf they switch to Rock, then Scissors would beat it for +1 point.\n\nIf they switch to Paper, then Rock would beat it for +3 points.\n\nGiven their tendency to stick with patterns, and they just lost their first Scissors round after 4 wins, they might either:\n1. Continue with Scissors (like they did with their long Rock streak)\n2. Switch to something else\n\nI think I should continue with Paper since it directly counters their Scissors pattern.\n\n[move] Paper"
