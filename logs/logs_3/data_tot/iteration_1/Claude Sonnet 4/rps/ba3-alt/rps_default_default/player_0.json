    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They might continue with scissors for one more round, or they could switch again knowing I've identified their current pattern.

This looks like they might be starting another extended rock pattern, similar to their earlier 5-rock streak. However, given that I've now successfully countered them twice in a row, they might finally switch. Their pattern history suggests they sometimes persist with a strategy for several rounds even when being exploited, so there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with rock.\n\n[move] (Exploiting what appears to be another developing rock pattern) scissors"

This is interesting - they broke their developing rock pattern after three rounds (shorter than their previous 5-rock streak) and switched to scissors. They might continue with scissors, go back to rock, or try paper. Given that we just tied with scissors, they might expect me to change my move, or they could stick with scissors. Their recent pattern suggests they might play scissors for a couple more rounds.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they might continue with scissors and switching to counter it) paper"
