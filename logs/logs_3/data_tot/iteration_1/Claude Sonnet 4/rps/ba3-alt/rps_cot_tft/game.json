Consider the opponent's recent shift:\n   - They just played rock for the 3rd time, breaking from scissors\n   - This happened after I predicted scissors (and played rock) the last 2 rounds\n   - They might be actively countering my expectation of their scissors preference\n   - The timing suggests strategic adaptation rather than random play\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - They've now tied with rock twice when I played rock (rounds 3, 7, 10)\n   - They might continue with rock if they think I'll stick with it\n   - Or they might return to scissors, their historical favorite\n   - If they expect me to switch from rock after the tie, they might play scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm still comfortably ahead (+4 points)\n   - The opponent is adapting but scissors is still their most common move\n   - If they return to scissors (their 60% preference), rock wins +1\n   - If they stick with rock, it's another tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper expecting me to continue with rock, I lose 3 points but stay ahead\n   - Their scissors tendency still outweighs the recent rock adaptation\n\n[move] (Continuing with rock as their scissors preference remains strongest despite recent adaptation) rock"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understanding the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner) vs -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner) vs -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties award 0 points\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing)\n   - If they play rock, I should play scissors to win +1 point\n   - If they play paper, I lose -3 points with scissors\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie with scissors\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Win +1 vs rock, tie vs scissors, lose -1 vs paper\n   - Playing rock: Win +3 vs paper, tie vs rock, lose -1 vs scissors  \n   - Playing paper: Win +1 vs scissors, tie vs paper, lose -3 vs rock\n\n5. Decision:\n   Given that fresh players commonly start with rock, and scissors beats rock with a decent +1 reward while having lower downside risk than rock, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors",

I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors only give +1/-1.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have established patterns yet. Fresh players often default to rock as it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move.\n\n4. If the opponent chooses rock (which is likely for a fresh player), I should choose paper to win 3 points.\n\n5. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenario with paper is:\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n   - If they choose paper: tie, 0 points\n   - If they choose rock: I win 3 points\n\n6. The expected value favors paper against an unpredictable opponent, especially one who might favor rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic decision:\n   - I'm still well ahead (+5 points) with room for strategic moves\n   - Their 52.4% scissors rate is strong and they just succeeded with it\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n   - My historical paper vs scissors record is excellent (5 wins, 0 losses from previous analysis)\n   - Given their pattern of returning to scissors and recent success with it, paper is the optimal counter\n\n[move] (Countering their return to dominant scissors strategy with paper) paper",
