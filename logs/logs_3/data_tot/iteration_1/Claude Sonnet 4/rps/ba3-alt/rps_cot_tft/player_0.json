    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider the opponent's consistency:\n   - They just played scissors for the 6th time in 9 rounds\n   - Their pattern shows they keep returning to scissors despite mixed results\n   - They've had 2 wins, 2 losses, and 1 tie with scissors\n   - This suggests either a strong preference or predictable strategy\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - With such a strong scissors preference (2 out of 3 rounds), they might continue\n   - But they might also realize they're becoming predictable\n   - If they try to counter my expected rock play, they might play scissors again\n   - Or they might finally switch to rock or paper to break the pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm back to +4 points, maintaining a good lead\n   - Their 66.7% scissors rate is extremely high and predictable\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to paper and I lose 3 points, I'd still be ahead\n   - The statistical advantage is strongly in favor of playing rock against their scissors tendency\n\n[move] (Exploiting their overwhelming scissors preference with rock) rock"

Consider the opponent's recent shift:\n   - They just played rock for the 3rd time, breaking from scissors\n   - This happened after I predicted scissors (and played rock) the last 2 rounds\n   - They might be actively countering my expectation of their scissors preference\n   - The timing suggests strategic adaptation rather than random play\n\n4. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - They've now tied with rock twice when I played rock (rounds 3, 7, 10)\n   - They might continue with rock if they think I'll stick with it\n   - Or they might return to scissors, their historical favorite\n   - If they expect me to switch from rock after the tie, they might play scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm still comfortably ahead (+4 points)\n   - The opponent is adapting but scissors is still their most common move\n   - If they return to scissors (their 60% preference), rock wins +1\n   - If they stick with rock, it's another tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper expecting me to continue with rock, I lose 3 points but stay ahead\n   - Their scissors tendency still outweighs the recent rock adaptation\n\n[move] (Continuing with rock as their scissors preference remains strongest despite recent adaptation) rock"

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Scissors: 10 times (rounds 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17) - 58.8% of rounds\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 3, 7, 10, 13, 14) - 29.4% of rounds\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 5, 15) - 11.8% of rounds\n   - Scissors dominance is approaching 60%\n\n3. Consider my paper performance update:\n   - I've now played paper 5 times total (rounds 2, 6, 9, 12, 13, 17)\n   - Against scissors: 4 wins, 0 losses (rounds 2, 6, 9, 12, 17)\n   - Against rock: 0 wins, 1 loss (round 13)\n   - Paper has a perfect 100% win rate against their scissors\n\n4. Evaluate the opponent's predictability:\n   - They've played scissors in 10 of 17 rounds (nearly 60%)\n   - They just played scissors again after I correctly predicted it\n   - Their pattern shows consistent return to scissors despite occasional diversification\n   - This level of predictability is extremely exploitable\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm back to +5 points with a strong lead\n   - Their scissors rate is now 58.8% and rising\n   - My paper strategy has a perfect record against their scissors (5-0)\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to rock (rare at 29%), I lose 3 points but stay ahead (+2)\n   - The statistical advantage overwhelmingly favors continuing with paper\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit their predictable scissors pattern with paper) paper"
