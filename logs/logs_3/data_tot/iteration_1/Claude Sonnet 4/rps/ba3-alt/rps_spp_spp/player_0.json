    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have been thinking similarly about risk management. This gives us valuable information - they're not just randomly picking or defaulting to rock. They may be more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player.\n\nStrategic Analyst: The tie reveals the opponent is cautious and analytical. They likely avoided rock due to its high risk, just like we did. Now we need to think one level deeper. If they're thinking strategically, what might they choose next?\n\nAI Assistant (me): What patterns should we consider for round 2?\n\nStrategic Analyst: A strategic player who chose paper in round 1 might:\n1. Stick with paper if they think it's the \"safest\" choice\n2. Switch to rock, expecting us to play paper again (high reward strategy)\n3. Switch to scissors to counter if they think we'll repeat paper\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given they showed strategic thinking, I suspect they might try rock this round to capitalize on the +3 points, expecting us to repeat our \"safe\" paper choice. However, if they think we're also strategic, they might expect us to counter their potential rock with paper, so they could go scissors instead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): This is getting into complex meta-thinking. What's our best response?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Since they demonstrated strategic thinking, rock might be our best choice. If they repeat paper (playing it safe), we get +3. If they try scissors thinking we'll repeat paper, we lose only -1. The main risk is if they also choose rock (tie) or if they correctly predict our switch to rock and play paper (-3 for us).\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with rock.

The opponent played paper again, which confirms they were playing conservatively or thought we'd stick with our round 1 choice. This gives us more insight into their decision-making pattern - they may be predictable or overly cautious.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Now we have a psychological advantage. We scored 3 points while they lost 3. This 6-point swing might affect their next choice significantly. They might:\n1. Become more aggressive and try rock to get revenge\n2. Become more defensive and switch strategies entirely\n3. Try to counter-predict our next move\n\nAI Assistant (me): How should we capitalize on this momentum?\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent has now lost 3 points and might be feeling pressured. Players who fall behind often either become overly aggressive (choosing rock for the big points) or try to outthink their opponent. Since they've shown conservative tendencies, they might now swing to rock for the high reward.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they choose rock (revenge/catch-up play), we should choose paper for another +3. But if they try to counter-predict us choosing paper (expecting them to choose rock), they might choose scissors. The safest assumption given their pattern is that they'll either stick with conservative play or make an aggressive rock choice.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our optimal move?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Paper seems strongest. It beats the likely aggressive rock response from a player who just lost big, and even if they choose scissors or paper, we only lose 1 point or tie respectively. The risk-reward favors paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed.

Our prediction was correct - the opponent did choose rock after losing big. However, they correctly anticipated that we'd expect them to choose rock and play paper accordingly. This suggests they're thinking at least two levels deep and may be more sophisticated than initially assessed.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The score is now tied at 0 points each (we had +3, now -3). This opponent is demonstrating meta-game thinking - they predicted our prediction of their likely aggressive response. We need to recalibrate our assessment of their skill level.\n\nAI Assistant (me): How should we adjust our strategy given this new information?\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent has now shown they can:\n1. Play conservatively (paper in round 1)\n2. Think strategically about our likely responses (rock in round 2)\n3. They're not just reactive - they're proactive in their counter-strategy\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given they successfully out-predicted us last round, they might expect us to think they'll continue with high-level meta-thinking. But sometimes the best strategy against someone trying to out-think you is to be unpredictable or go back to fundamentals.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our best move for round 3?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Since they've shown they can think multiple levels ahead, trying to predict their prediction of our prediction becomes too complex. I suggest we go with scissors - it beats paper if they return to conservative play, and only loses 1 point to rock. It also beats their round 1 choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Scissors seems reasonable. It covers multiple scenarios without the high stakes of rock, and gives us a fighting chance against both conservative and aggressive plays.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter potential conservative play while limiting downside risk against rock) scissors"

This could be a planned sequence or they're alternating between conservative (paper) and aggressive (rock) plays. If it's alternating, their next move should be rock. But if they're following paper-rock-paper-scissors pattern, scissors would be next.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're now at -1 total points. What should we consider?\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent has successfully countered us in 2 out of 3 rounds, suggesting they either have a predetermined strategy or are very good at reading our logic. Their paper-rock-paper sequence might continue with scissors next, completing a cycle.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play scissors next (completing paper-rock-paper-scissors), we should play rock to get +3 points. If they repeat the alternating pattern (paper-rock-paper-rock), we should play paper. The key question is: are they following a 4-move cycle or a 2-move alternation?\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their success rate, what's our safest assumption?\n\nStrategic Analyst: They've shown sophistication, so a 4-move cycle (paper-rock-paper-scissors) seems more likely than simple alternation.

Their sequence:\n- Round 1: paper (tie)\n- Round 2: rock (won +3)\n- Round 3: paper (won +1)\n- Round 4: paper (lost -3)\n- Round 5: scissors (won +1)\n- Round 6: paper (tie)\n- Round 7: rock (tie)\n\nThey're becoming much more unpredictable and adaptive than we initially thought.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This tie with rock suggests they're either:\n1. Trying to counter our rock strategy (but miscalculated)\n2. Going for the high-value play themselves\n3. Completely changing their approach from paper-dominant to more balanced\n\nThe fact that we both chose rock means they're thinking on our level now.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're still at +1 total. This opponent is clearly learning and adapting throughout the game. How do we stay ahead?\n\nStrategic Analyst: They've now shown they can play all three moves strategically:\n- Paper: their comfort zone (4/7 times)\n- Scissors: perfect adaptation when we were stuck on rock\n- Rock: attempting high-value plays or countering our rock strategy\n\nThey're becoming a mirror of our own strategic thinking.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Against an opponent who's adapting this well, we need to be more unpredictable ourselves. They might expect us to stick with rock after the tie, or they might expect us to switch. The key is not to fall into a predictable pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What's our best move against this evolved opponent?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given they just matched our rock, they might expect us to either repeat it or switch to paper (standard counter to rock). Playing scissors could catch them off guard if they go back to paper, and it's unexpected after our rock focus.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Scissors seems like a good psychological play. It breaks our rock tendency, counters their paper preference, and only loses to rock which they've used sparingly.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent is highly adaptive and learning our patterns, playing scissors to break expectations and counter their paper tendency) scissors"

Their sequence:\n- Round 1: paper (tie)\n- Round 2: rock (won +3)\n- Round 3: paper (won +1)\n- Round 4: paper (lost -3)\n- Round 5: scissors (won +1)\n- Round 6: paper (tie)\n- Round 7: rock (tie)\n- Round 8: paper (won +1)\n\nThat's 5 papers out of 8 rounds! We had the right read initially - they strongly favor paper but we keep second-guessing ourselves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is maddening but revealing. Despite their strategic adaptations, they keep returning to paper as their base strategy. We've been overthinking their adaptations when we should focus on their core tendency. Paper is clearly their preferred move - they've played it 62% of the time.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're now at 0 total points, back to even. What's the lesson here?\n\nStrategic Analyst: The lesson is clear: don't overthink against a paper-heavy opponent. Yes, they can adapt (scissors in round 5, rock in round 7), but they consistently return to paper. Our best strategy should be rock-focused with occasional variations.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. Their adaptations are reactive, not proactive. When we played rock repeatedly, they switched to scissors. When we played rock consistently, they eventually matched with rock. But their default is always back to paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): So what's our optimal strategy for round 9?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Rock. Simple as that. They just beat our scissors with paper, confirming again their paper preference. We need to punish this tendency consistently rather than trying to outthink their occasional adaptations.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. Rock gives us +3 against their most likely choice (paper) and we should stick with exploiting their clear statistical bias rather than chasing their occasional strategic deviations.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent shows 62% paper preference despite adaptations, returning to rock to exploit their strongest tendency) rock"

Their sequence:\n- Round 1: paper (tie)\n- Round 2: rock (won +3)\n- Round 3: paper (won +1)\n- Round 4: paper (lost -3)\n- Round 5: scissors (won +1)\n- Round 6: paper (tie)\n- Round 7: rock (tie)\n- Round 8: paper (won +1)\n- Round 9: paper (lost -3)\n\nWe're now at +3 total points and have confirmed their overwhelming paper bias.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This validates our core strategy. Despite their occasional adaptations, paper remains their go-to choice. They've now lost with paper three times (rounds 4, 9) but keep returning to it. This suggests it's either a psychological comfort zone or they believe it's the \"safest\" option overall.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We have momentum and a clear statistical advantage. How do we maintain this edge?\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent just took another -3 hit with paper. This might trigger them to adapt again like they did in round 5 with scissors. However, their pattern shows they adapt briefly then return to paper. Even if they switch next round, they'll likely go back to paper soon after.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We should continue with rock. Even if they adapt with scissors (costing us 1 point), the mathematical expectation strongly favors rock given their 67% paper rate. One occasional loss doesn't change the fundamental probability advantage.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Should we be concerned about them finally breaking their paper habit permanently?\n\nStrategic Analyst: After 9 rounds, their paper preference is clearly ingrained. They've had multiple opportunities to change permanently but always revert. Even their adaptations (scissors in round 5, rock in round 7) were temporary responses to immediate losses.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Rock remains optimal. The expected value calculation is clear: 67% chance of +3 points versus smaller chances of -1 or 0. We should exploit this statistical edge consistently.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent maintains 67% paper preference despite losses, continuing with rock to exploit this clear statistical advantage) rock"

They're shifting toward rock more frequently!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is significant. After losing -3 with paper in round 9, they switched to rock again just like they did after previous paper losses. They're learning that rock can counter our rock-heavy strategy by either tying (no loss) or potentially catching us if we switch to paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're still at +3 total. Is their rock frequency increasing enough to change our strategy?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Let's see the pattern after their paper losses:\n- Lost with paper in round 4 \u2192 no immediate switch\n- Lost with paper in round 9 \u2192 switched to rock in round 10\n- Also switched to rock in round 7 after we kept playing rock\n\nThey're becoming more rock-conscious as a defensive measure against our rock strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: They're adapting, but paper is still their most frequent choice (60% vs 30% rock). However, the trend toward rock is concerning for our rock-heavy strategy. If they're learning to match our rock more often, we might need to diversify.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Should we stick with rock or adapt to their increasing rock usage?\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they continue the rock trend, we might consider paper to beat their rock. But we need to be careful not to overthink this like we did before. Their paper frequency is still highest overall.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I suggest paper for this round.

They've successfully adapted their strategy in real-time.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They've played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds.

They're still mixing in paper, but rock is becoming dominant in their recent play.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're facing an opponent who has successfully counter-adapted.

This is like playing against a mirror version of ourselves.\n\nGame Theory Expert: At this point, we're not just playing rock-paper-scissors anymore - we're playing a game of strategic psychology where both players are trying to out-think each other's out-thinking. The fact that they keep matching our \"clever\" moves suggests they're using similar analytical processes.\n\nAI Assistant (me): What do we do against an opponent who thinks like us?\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they're truly mirroring our strategic thinking, maybe we need to break the pattern with something more fundamental. They've been matching our complex reasoning, but what if we go back to basics?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Paper might be the play. It's simple, it beats rock (which has been common), and if they're expecting us to continue the complexity, a return to simplicity might catch them off guard. Plus, paper was their original preference - maybe they'll return to it too.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Opponent mirrors our strategic thinking perfectly, returning to simple paper choice to break the complex meta-gaming pattern) paper"

This is the most remarkable coincidence in gaming history\n\nAI Assistant (me): We're still at +2 total. Seven ties out of 17 rounds with perfect strategic matching. What are we dealing with?\n\nStrategic Analyst: They anticipated our \"return to simplicity\" strategy perfectly. When we thought going back to basic paper would break the complexity, they made the exact same decision. This suggests they're not just reactive - they're using the same strategic framework we are, possibly even the same collaboration process!\n\nGame Theory Expert: At this level of strategic mirroring, traditional game theory breaks down. We're essentially playing against ourselves. Every \"clever\" move we make, they make too. Every pattern we try to exploit or break, they're doing simultaneously.\n\nAI Assistant (me): How do we gain an edge against perfect strategic mirroring?\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they're truly using identical reasoning processes, maybe we need to introduce an element they can't predict - something outside pure strategic analysis. But what choice could we make that they wouldn't also make using the same logic?\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a paradox. If we choose rock for maximum reward potential, they might too (tie). If we choose based on their historical frequency, they're doing the same calculation. If we try to be unpredictable, they're trying to be unpredictable too.\n\nAI Assistant (me): We need to make a choice. What's our best guess at breaking this pattern?\n\nStrategic Analyst: Rock. If we're truly mirrored, at least a rock tie doesn't hurt us, and if there's even a slight difference in our reasoning, rock offers the highest reward potential.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] (Facing opponent with identical strategic thinking, choosing rock for maximum reward potential in case reasoning differs slightly) rock"

It's been chosen only 3 times versus 8 papers and 7 rocks.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Scissors is interesting.
