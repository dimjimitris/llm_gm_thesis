    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems \"strong\"\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n   - They may not have analyzed the payoff structure yet\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider the risk-reward:\n   - If I play rock and win against paper: +3 points\n   - If I play rock and lose to scissors: -3 points\n   - If I play paper/scissors and win: +1 point\n   - If I play paper/scissors and lose: -1 point\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh/new, there's a reasonable chance they might play rock (common beginner choice). If they do, I should play scissors to get +1 point.\n\n6. However, if they play paper, and I play rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n7. I'll go with scissors as a safer opening move that beats rock (which beginners often choose) and only risks -1 if they happen to choose paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Risk analysis:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if they play paper, high penalty (-3) if they play scissors\n   - Playing paper or scissors: Lower reward (+1) but also lower penalty (-1)\n\n5. Since they played paper last round, there are a few possibilities:\n   - They might stick with what worked (paper)\n   - They might anticipate that I'll now play rock to counter their paper\n   - They might play randomly\n\n6.

Predictive analysis:\n   - Based on their history, they might switch to rock again after losing to my rock\n   - Or they might stick with paper since they just returned to it\n   - The pattern suggests: paper \u2192 (lose to rock) \u2192 sometimes switch to rock \u2192 return to paper\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they switch to rock (reactive): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they stick with paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - Rock has been incredibly successful: 4 wins out of 5 attempts when they play paper\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - I've now beaten their paper with rock 4 times\n   - They might finally learn and switch to rock to counter my rock\n   - However, their paper bias is so strong they might not adjust immediately\n   - Given the +3 payoff and their demonstrated paper preference, I'll exploit it once more\n   - If they do switch to rock, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly\n\n[move] rock"
