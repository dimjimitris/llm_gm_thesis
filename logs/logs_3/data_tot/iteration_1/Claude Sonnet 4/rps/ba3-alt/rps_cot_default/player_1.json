    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often default to rock as it seems \"strongest\" conceptually, or they might choose randomly.\n\nIf they choose rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose scissors, I should play rock to win 1 point.\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest potential loss (-3 points), and fresh players might gravitate toward rock, playing paper seems like a good opening strategy. It protects me from the worst-case scenario while giving me the chance for the highest reward.\n\n[move] paper"

They just played rock twice after the last scissors. This could be:\n- Part of a new \"scissors + 2 rocks\" sequence\n- Or they might continue with more rocks\n\nI'm at -20 points and the tie helped stop further bleeding. My conservative rock strategy has been working better - getting ties instead of -3 losses.\n\nGiven their strong preference for rock (appears 16 times vs 6 scissors, 0 paper), and the fact that they might continue the rock sequence or switch to scissors, rock remains the safest choice:\n- vs rock: tie (0)\n- vs scissors: lose (-1) but manageable\n- vs paper: lose (-1) but they've never played paper\n\nI'll stick with the conservative approach.\n\n[move] rock"

Based on their historical pattern, the next move is likely rock. But I need to be strategic about when to take risks vs when to play it safe.\n\nAt -21 points, I'm in serious trouble. My conservative rock strategy limits losses but isn't helping me recover. However, my aggressive paper plays have been disasters.\n\nIf they play rock (likely), I could:\n- Play rock: tie (0)\n- Play paper: win (+3) but massive risk\n- Play scissors: lose (-3)\n\nGiven the pattern suggests rock is coming and I desperately need points, maybe this is the time for a calculated paper risk. But I've been wrong so many times...\n\nI'll try one more conservative rock play to see their next move.\n\n[move] rock"
