Let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems \"strong\"\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n   - They may not have analyzed the payoff structure yet\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should consider the risk-reward:\n   - If I play rock and win against paper: +3 points\n   - If I play rock and lose to scissors: -3 points\n   - If I play paper/scissors and win: +1 point\n   - If I play paper/scissors and lose: -1 point\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh/new, there's a reasonable chance they might play rock (common beginner choice). If they do, I should play scissors to get +1 point.\n\n6. However, if they play paper, and I play rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n7. I'll go with scissors as a safer opening move that beats rock (which beginners often choose) and only risks -1 if they happen to choose paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Risk analysis:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if they play paper, high penalty (-3) if they play scissors\n   - Playing paper or scissors: Lower reward (+1) but also lower penalty (-1)\n\n5.

Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock again: High reward if they stick with paper, but high risk if they've learned and switch to scissors\n   - Playing paper: Safe option that beats rock, moderate reward/risk\n   - Playing scissors: Would lose to paper if they continue the pattern\n\n5.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're adapting!

Opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper\n   - Paper appears 7/10 times (70%)\n   - Rock appears 3/10 times (30%)\n   - They just played paper 3 times in a row (Rounds 8-10)\n\n3. Critical insight:\n   - I have beaten their paper with rock 5 times now for +15 total points\n   - They keep returning to paper despite consistent losses to my rock\n   - This suggests either:\n     - They haven't fully grasped the payoff structure\n     - They have a very strong psychological preference for paper\n     - They're not adapting strategically\n\n4. My rock success rate:\n   - Rock vs their paper: 5 wins out of 5 attempts\n   - This is an extremely profitable pattern\n\n5. Strategic prediction:\n   - Given their very strong paper bias and lack of adaptation\n   - They might continue with paper or finally switch to rock defensively\n   - Based on past behavior, even when they lose repeatedly to rock, they return to paper quickly\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Their paper preference is so dominant and profitable for me\n   - Even if they're \"due\" to switch, their pattern suggests they struggle to break the paper habit\n   - The mathematical expectation strongly favors rock given their 70% paper rate\n   - I'll continue exploiting this incredibly profitable pattern\n\n[move] rock"

However, if they play paper, and I play rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n7.

Paper and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.

They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to counter my paper (so play rock)\n3. Choose randomly\n\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play rock to win 1 point.\nIf they switch to rock (to counter my paper), I should play paper again to win 3 points.\nIf they play paper, I should play scissors to win 1 point.\n\nGiven that they might try to counter my previous paper move by playing rock, and rock gives me the highest potential reward if I counter it correctly, I'll play paper again.\n\n[move] paper"

They clearly favor rock and have never played paper. If they continue this pattern, they're likely to play either rock or scissors next.\n\nGiven their tendency to play rock after I've played paper, and since I just played paper, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll avoid paper now, they might play scissors.\n\nLet me play rock to counter a potential scissors, which would give me +1 point.

Against a fresh player, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their default.\n\n6.

Strategic insight:\n   - They have a highly predictable behavioral cycle\n   - Despite losing consistently to my rock when they play paper, they can't break the pattern\n   - Their defensive rock phases are brief and follow a strict 2-round pattern\n\n5. Prediction for Round 17:\n   - They just returned to paper (their comfort zone)\n   - Based on their pattern, they might stay with paper for 1-2 rounds\n   - Or they might switch to rock quickly if they're learning to anticipate my rock\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Their paper preference combined with my rock strategy has been 100% successful\n   - Even if they're starting to learn, their behavioral patterns are deeply ingrained\n   - The +3 payoff is extremely valuable\n   - Their paper bias (56.25%) still favors my rock strategy\n   - I'll continue exploiting their most profitable weakness\n\n[move] rock",
