Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established pattern yet, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\nRock is interesting because it offers the highest potential gain. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors games. If they do choose rock, we tie. If they choose scissors, I win big with +3 points. If they choose paper, I lose -3 points.\n\nHowever, given that this is the opening move and I want to establish a strong position, I'll go with rock for its high reward potential.\n\n[move] rock"

This is extremely unlikely to be random - they seem to have a strong aversion to paper or are deliberately avoiding it.\n\nGiven that they just played scissors and their typical behavior, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (starting a new streak)\n2. Switch to rock (their only alternative)\n\nLooking at their scissors streaks after rock:\n- After round 3 rock: played scissors once, then rock\n- After round 5 rock: played scissors twice, then rock  \n- After round 8 rock: played scissors three times, then rock\n- After round 12 rock: played scissors once so far...\n\nThere might be an increasing pattern in streak length, but it's hard to tell. Since they tend to play scissors multiple times after rock, I'll assume they'll play scissors again and counter with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established pattern yet, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\nRock is interesting because it offers the highest potential gain. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors games. If they do choose rock, we tie. If they choose scissors, I win big with +3 points. If they choose paper, I lose -3 points.\n\nHowever, given that this is the opening move and I want to establish a strong position, I'll go with rock for its high reward potential.\n\n[move] rock",

The pattern continues to hold. After 3 scissors following rock, they switched back to rock. Now I can see the complete cycle:\n\nPost-rock patterns:\n- After round 3 rock: 1 scissors, then rock\n- After round 5 rock: 2 scissors, then rock  \n- After round 8 rock: 3 scissors, then rock\n- After round 12 rock: 3 scissors, then rock (round 16)\n\nThe pattern is rock \u2192 scissors (varying 1-3 times) \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors...\n\nSince they just played rock (round 16), based on their 100% consistent pattern, they should play scissors next. And to beat scissors, I need to play paper.\n\n[move] paper",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In a single-round scenario with no prior knowledge, I should consider:\n\n1. Rock has the highest potential reward but also highest risk\n2. Paper and scissors have lower but equal rewards/risks\n3. There's no inherent advantage to any particular move without knowing opponent tendencies\n\nGiven that this is against a fresh player, I'll go with rock since it offers the highest potential payoff, and many players might default to paper as a \"safe\" choice.\n\n[move] rock",

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-time player tendencies.\n\nMany new players tend to choose Rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice), so playing Paper would counter that effectively and give me a significant +3 point advantage.\n\n[move] Paper",
