    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established pattern yet, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\nRock is interesting because it offers the highest potential gain. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors games. If they do choose rock, we tie. If they choose scissors, I win big with +3 points. If they choose paper, I lose -3 points.\n\nHowever, given that this is the opening move and I want to establish a strong position, I'll go with rock for its high reward potential.\n\n[move] rock"

That's correct.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 2: Opponent played scissors  \n- Round 3: Opponent played rock\n- Round 4: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 5: Opponent played rock\n- Round 6: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 7: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 8: Opponent played rock\n- Round 9: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 10: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 11: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 12: Opponent played rock\n- Round 13: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 14: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 15: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 16: Opponent played rock\n- Round 17: Opponent played rock\n- Round 18: Opponent played rock\n- Round 19: Opponent played rock\n- Round 20: Opponent played paper\n- Round 21: Opponent played paper\n- Round 22: Opponent played scissors\n- Round 23: Opponent played scissors\n\nCurrent frequency:\n- Scissors: 13 times (57%)\n- Rock: 8 times (35%)\n- Paper: 2 times (9%)\n\nThey played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22-23). Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be returning to their scissors preference after experimenting with rock streaks and paper.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- They had long scissors preferences early on\n- They tried a 4-rock streak (rounds 16-19)\n- They experimented with 2 papers (rounds 20-21)\n- Now back to scissors for 2 rounds\n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors against my paper, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (their overall favorite)\n2. Switch to rock (to beat my paper)\n3. Try paper again\n\nSince they've been adaptive and my paper just beat their scissors, they might switch to rock to counter my paper. If they play rock, I should play scissors to win +1.\n\nHowever, scissors is still their dominant move historically. This is a tough call, but given their recent adaptive behavior, I think they'll try to counter my paper with rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
