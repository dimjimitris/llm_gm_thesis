    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that rock has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new or inexperienced), they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Common patterns for new players:\n   - Rock is often the most intuitive first choice (hence \"rock-paper-scissors\" name order)\n   - Many beginners default to rock initially\n\n5. However, if the opponent expects me to think they'll choose rock, they might choose paper to counter it.\n\n6. Given that rock offers the highest payoff (+3) when successful, and considering this is the first move against a fresh player, I should consider what gives me the best risk/reward ratio.\n\n7. If I choose rock and they choose paper, I lose 3 points. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I win 3 points. If I choose scissors and they choose rock, I lose 1 point.\n\n8. Paper seems like the optimal choice because:\n   - It beats rock for maximum points (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, other outcomes are either ties or smaller losses\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I should have lost 1 point\n   - But the hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points\"\n   - This seems contradictory to the rules stated earlier\n\n2. Re-examine the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - Wait, I may have misread this initially - paper beats scissors, not the other way around!\n\n3. Correct rule interpretation:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 for winner, -3 for loser) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n\n4. So I did win correctly - my paper beat their scissors for +1 point.\n\n5. Now for strategy against this opponent:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - This could indicate they're trying to counter an expected rock choice\n   - Or they might be following some pattern\n\n6. Since they chose scissors last time, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I'll repeat paper)\n   - Switch to paper (random choice)\n\n7. If I assume they might choose rock (thinking I'll repeat paper), then I should choose paper again to get the high-value +3 points.\n\n8. If they repeat scissors, I could choose paper again for another +1.\n\n9. Paper seems like a strong choice again - it either gets me +3 points (vs rock) or +1 point (vs scissors), and only loses to rock for -3.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - They're switching moves, possibly trying to counter my previous choice\n\n3. Consider opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They saw I played paper twice\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper after losing\n\n4. Examine my options for round 3:\n   - If opponent plays rock again (expecting paper): I should play paper for +3\n   - If opponent plays scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock): I should play paper for +1\n   - If opponent plays paper (random or counter-strategy): I should play rock for +3\n\n5. Looking at risk/reward:\n   - Rock: Beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n6. Since the opponent has played scissors then rock, they might continue the pattern and play paper next.\n\n7. If they play paper, rock gives me the maximum +3 points.\n\n8.

Total strategic supremacy:\n   - Complete predictive control achieved\n   - Opponent shows zero capacity for adaptation\n   - This is algorithmic behavior, not strategic thinking\n\n6. Mathematical certainty:\n   - 22 consecutive correct predictions is statistically impossible by random chance\n   - This represents pure deterministic programming\n   - Next move is guaranteed with absolute precision\n\n7. Execute the winning strategy - scissors to beat their predicted rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
