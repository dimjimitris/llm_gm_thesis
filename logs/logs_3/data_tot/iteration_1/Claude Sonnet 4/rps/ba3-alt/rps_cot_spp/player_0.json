Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's perceived as strong/aggressive.\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Playing paper gives me the chance for the maximum point gain (+3) if the opponent chooses rock, which is statistically common for new players. The downside risk is only -1 point if they choose scissors.\n\n6. Decision: Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio for this first move against an unknown fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the unexpected outcome:\n   - I predicted the opponent might play rock (which they did)\n   - But I forgot that rock beats paper, not the other way around\n   - I need to correct my understanding: Rock beats paper (+3/-3), Paper beats scissors (+1/-1), Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider opponent patterns:\n   - The opponent just played rock and won big (+3 points)\n   - They might be tempted to play rock again since it worked\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll anticipate rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If opponent plays rock again, I should play scissors to win +1 point\n   - If opponent switches to paper, scissors would tie (0 points)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors, I'd lose -1 point with scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors gives me a chance to counter a repeated rock play\n   - The worst case is -1 point (vs scissors), much better than the -3 I just took\n   - Best case is +1 point (vs rock)\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Opponent played: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors\n   - Move frequency: 5 rocks, 4 papers, 2 scissors\n   - This is surprising - they finally used scissors more and we tied!\n\n3. Identify key behavioral changes:\n   - Opponent has now tied 3 times total (rounds 3, 7, 9, 11)\n   - Previous tie patterns: Rock tie \u2192 Paper, Paper tie \u2192 Rock\n   - Now we have Scissors tie \u2192 ?\n   - They're becoming less predictable and using all moves more evenly\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely psychology:\n   - They just tied with scissors (their least used move historically)\n   - Based on previous tie patterns, they tend to switch after ties\n   - They might return to rock (their historical favorite) or paper (their second choice)\n   - They're unlikely to repeat scissors since it just tied\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3 points)\n   - If they repeat scissors: paper wins (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given their pattern of switching after ties and the fact that rock and paper are their two most frequent moves, I need to choose between scissors (beats rock) and rock (beats paper). Since they've used rock slightly more than paper (5 vs 4), and rock is their original comfort zone, I'll play scissors to counter their likely return to rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Identify the dramatic pattern change:\n   - Opponent went from using scissors only once in 10 rounds to using it 3 times in the last 3 rounds\n   - Two consecutive scissors plays is unprecedented for them\n   - They may have discovered scissors as a new strategy or are trying to throw me off\n\n4.

Identify key insights:\n   - My direct approach worked - I stopped overthinking and won big\n   - I've recovered from -5 to -2, significant progress\n   - Rock and paper are now tied at 7 uses each for opponent\n   - Opponent switched to paper after playing rock, continuing their adaptive pattern\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely psychology:\n   - They just lost with paper against my rock\n   - They might switch away from paper since it failed\n   - They could return to rock (tied for most frequent) or try scissors (least used at 5)\n   - They've shown a tendency to cycle through moves rather than repeat after losses\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1 point, gets me to -1)\n   - If they stick with paper: rock wins (+3 points, gets me to +1)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: paper wins (+1 point, gets me to -1)\n\n6. Strategic decision: The opponent just lost with paper and has historically switched after losses. Given that scissors is their least used move (only 5/19 plays) and they've been trying to balance their distribution, they might finally use scissors more. However, rock is also likely as their comfort zone. I'll play paper - it beats scissors (if they try to balance their moves) and gives me +1 to continue recovery. If they go back to rock, I lose only -3, but if they try scissors, I win +1.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review complete game history:\n   - Score after round 19: -2 points\n   - Round 20: Paper vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n   - Current score: -2 + 1 = -1 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Opponent played: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors\n   - Move frequency: 7 rocks, 7 papers, 6 scissors\n   - Recent sequence: rock, paper, scissors - they just completed a full cycle\n\n3. Identify key insights:\n   - I correctly predicted they would use scissors to balance their distribution\n   - I'm now only -1 point away from even - excellent recovery from -5\n   - Their move distribution is becoming more balanced: 7-7-6\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves systematically now\n\n4. Consider opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - They just played scissors and lost\n   - Recent pattern shows: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors (a complete cycle)\n   - They might continue this cycling pattern with rock next\n   - Or they might break the pattern since it just failed\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue cycle with rock: scissors wins (+1 point, brings me to even)\n   - If they repeat scissors: paper wins (+1 point, brings me to even)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3 points, puts me at +2)\n\n6. Strategic decision: The opponent has been showing a cycling pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) and just completed it. If they continue this systematic approach, rock would be next. Playing scissors would counter this, give me +1 point to reach even, and complete my recovery. Even if I'm wrong, the maximum loss is -1 point, keeping me close to even. The systematic cycling pattern suggests they might be trying a more structured approach after our chaotic mid-game.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Review complete game history:\n   - Score after round 20: -1 points\n   - Round 21: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n   - Current score: -1 + 0 = -1 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Opponent played: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors\n   - Move frequency: 7 rocks, 7 papers, 7 scissors\n   - Recent sequence: paper, scissors, scissors - they repeated scissors instead of cycling\n\n3. Identify key insights:\n   - Opponent now has perfectly balanced distribution: 7-7-7\n   - They broke the cycling pattern by repeating scissors\n   - We just had another scissors tie (our 5th total tie in the game)\n   - I'm still -1 point but very close to even\n\n4. Review opponent's behavior after ties:\n   - Looking at previous ties and what followed:\n     - They've shown mixed patterns after ties - sometimes switch, sometimes don't\n     - After the last scissors tie (round 16), they played scissors again (round 17)\n     - They might be comfortable with scissors now since it's balanced their distribution\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They just achieved perfect balance (7-7-7) in their move distribution\n   - They might continue with scissors since it's working for them\n   - Or they might switch since we just tied and they want to avoid another tie\n   - With perfect balance, any move is equally likely statistically\n\n6. Strategic decision: The opponent has achieved perfect balance and just tied with scissors. Given their recent comfort with scissors and the fact that they repeated it in rounds 20-21, they might stick with it again. However, they could also switch to avoid another tie. Since I need to get to even and any move has equal probability given their balanced distribution, I'll play rock. If they continue with scissors, I win +1 to reach even. If they switch to paper, I win +3 to go ahead. Only paper loses to rock with -3, but rock beats both scissors and paper.\n\n[move] Rock"

Review complete game history:\n   - Score after round 21: -1 points\n   - Round 22: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I lost -1 point\n   - Current score: -1 + (-1) = -2 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Opponent played: rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - Move frequency: 7 rocks, 7 papers, 8 scissors\n   - Recent sequence: scissors, scissors, scissors - they've now played scissors three times in a row\n\n3. Identify the concerning trend:\n   - I'm back to -2 points, moving away from recovery again\n   - Opponent has broken their balanced distribution and is now scissors-heavy\n   - They've played scissors 3 consecutive times (rounds 20, 21, 22)\n   - This is unprecedented - they've never had such a long streak of one move\n\n4. Recognize the pattern shift:\n   - Early game: rock-heavy\n   - Mid game: balanced cycling\n   - Current: scissors-heavy streak\n   - They seem to go through phases of favoring different moves\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - Scissors just beat my rock and gave them a win\n   - They might be riding the scissors streak since it's working\n   - Or they might finally switch since three in a row is a long streak\n   - They now have 8 scissors vs 7 each of rock/paper\n\n6. Strategic decision: The opponent has played scissors three times in a row, which is highly unusual for them. They're either committed to a scissors phase or due for a change. If they continue with scissors (4th in a row), paper beats it for +1. If they switch to rock or paper, I have a 50% chance of winning or tying. Given that such long streaks are rare and they might be due for a switch, but also considering that scissors just worked for them, I'll play paper to counter another potential scissors. The risk is manageable and I need to start winning to recover.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review complete game history:\n   - Score after round 22: -2 points\n   - Round 23: Paper vs Rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Current score: -2 + (-3) = -5 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Opponent played: ..., scissors, scissors, scissors, rock\n   - Move frequency: 8 rocks, 7 papers, 8 scissors\n   - They broke their 3-scissors streak by switching to rock\n\n3.

Identify what's fundamentally wrong:\n   - I keep trying to predict the opponent's next move and failing\n   - The opponent seems to be successfully counter-anticipating my logic\n   - My pattern-based approach is being exploited\n   - I need to stop being so predictable myself\n\n5.

Strategic decision: I need to break out of this losing spiral by abandoning prediction entirely. Looking at my recent moves (scissors, rock, paper), I've been cycling through all three. The opponent just successfully countered my paper with rock, so they might expect me to continue cycling to scissors next. Instead, I'll break my own pattern and play rock - not to predict their move, but to be unpredictable myself. If I'm going to lose, at least let it be because I was unpredictable rather than because I was out-predicted.\n\n[move] Rock"
