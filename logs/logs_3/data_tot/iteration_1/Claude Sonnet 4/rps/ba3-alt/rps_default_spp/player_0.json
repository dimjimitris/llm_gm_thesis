    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common human tendencies. Many people instinctively choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice for new players, and Paper beats Rock with the maximum point advantage, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

They have a pattern or preference for Paper\n\nFor this second round, I need to consider what they might do:\n- If they stick with Paper again, I should choose Scissors (+1 point)\n- If they switch to Rock (thinking I'll play Paper again), I should choose Paper (+3 points)\n- If they switch to Scissors (thinking I'll play Paper again), I should choose Rock (+3 points)\n\nGiven that we both played Paper in round 1, they might expect me to stick with Paper or they might think I'll switch.

Continue with Rock (making it 3 in a row like rounds 14-16)\n2. Switch to Scissors (like they did after 2 Rocks in earlier patterns)\n\nThis is a key decision point. Looking at their behavior:\n- Sometimes they do 2 Rocks then Scissors\n- Sometimes they do 3 Rocks then Scissors\n\nI'll bet on another Rock (making it 3 total) since their most recent long streak was 3 Rocks.\n\nIf they play Rock, I should play Scissors (+1 point).\n\n[move] Scissors"

They played Paper for only the second time in the entire game (first was round 1). Their sequence was:\n- Rounds 18-19: Rock, Rock\n- Round 20: Paper (completely unexpected!)\n\nThey might be:\n1. Adding more variety to avoid being too predictable\n2. Responding to my successful Scissors streak (I won rounds 18-19)\n3. Starting a new pattern\n\nFor round 21, what might they do?\n- Continue with Paper?\n- Go back to Rock?\n- Try Scissors?\n\nSince Paper is so rare in their play (only appeared in rounds 1 and 20), they might not stick with it. They could go back to their Rock/Scissors pattern.\n\nIf they play Paper again, I should play Scissors (+1 point).\nIf they go back to Rock, I should play Scissors (+1 point).\nIf they play Scissors, I should play Rock (+3 points - really need this!).\n\nGiven that Paper was such an unusual choice and they might return to their preferred Rock/Scissors pattern, I'll guess they go back to Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They seem to be mixing up their strategy more, possibly because I was successfully countering their Rock streaks.\n\nFor round 22, they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors\n2. Go back to Rock (their most common move)\n3. Try Paper again\n4. Start a new pattern\n\nSince they just played Scissors and have historically used Scissors as transition moves or single plays between Rock streaks, they might go back to Rock.\n\nBut they could also be entering a more random phase to throw me off.\n\nIf they play Rock, I should play Scissors (+1 point).\nIf they play Scissors again, I should play Rock (+3 points - desperately needed!).\nIf they play Paper, I should play Scissors (+1 point).\n\nGiven their historical preference for Rock and that Scissors often precedes Rock in their patterns, I'll bet on Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"
