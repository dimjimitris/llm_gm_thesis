    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might:\n   - Choose rock thinking it's \"strong\"\n   - Choose scissors as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Make a random choice\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper: I beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)\n   - If I play rock: I beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n   - If I play scissors: I beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio - it can win the maximum points (+3) against rock, and only loses 1 point to scissors. Given that many new players gravitate toward rock (thinking it's powerful), paper seems like the optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I lost and got -1 points (the hint says I won with +1 points, but based on the rules, scissors should beat paper)\n   - Wait - let me recheck the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So I did win correctly with paper beating scissors for +1 point\n\n2. Gather information about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors in the first round\n   - This could indicate they're either random, or they might have a pattern\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - Some players alternate moves\n   - Some players stick with what they think \"should have worked\"\n   - Some players try to counter what beat them (they might now play rock to beat my paper)\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If opponent plays rock (to counter my previous paper): I should play paper again (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays paper (copying my winning move): I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (repeating their move): I should play paper again (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3) and could counter if they switch to paper, and paper worked well last round, I need to decide between these. Given that opponents often try to counter what just beat them, they might play rock. But they also might copy my winning paper move.\n\nI'll go with rock to potentially get the high +3 reward if they play paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the new pattern:\n   - After the disruption in rounds 6-7, they've now played scissors THREE times in a row\n   - Recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They appear to be stuck on scissors or have adopted a scissors-heavy strategy\n\n3. Consider why they keep playing scissors:\n   - Maybe they think I'll eventually switch away from paper\n   - They could be trying to establish a pattern to then break it\n   - Or they're genuinely stuck in a repetitive choice\n\n4. Predict their next move (Round 11):\n   - If they continue with scissors: paper beats it (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to rock: paper beats it (+3)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock beats it (+3)\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has been working perfectly against their scissors streak\n   - Paper also beats rock for maximum points if they switch\n   - Only loses to paper, but they haven't shown paper preference recently\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given their three consecutive scissors plays and that paper beats scissors (+1) and rock (+3), while only losing to paper, I should continue with paper. The pattern suggests they're likely to play scissors again.\n\n[move] paper"

Identify the striking pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR consecutive times (rounds 8-11)\n   - This is an extremely strong pattern of repetition\n   - They seem completely locked into playing scissors\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They might be hoping I'll eventually change from paper\n   - They could be testing my patience or trying to establish a false pattern\n   - Or they're genuinely stuck in this choice and can't break out\n\n4.

Predict their next move (Round 13):\n   - They just succeeded with rock, so they might:\n     - Stick with rock (since it worked)\n     - Return to scissors (their previous pattern)\n     - Try paper next (completing rock-paper-scissors)\n     - Be more unpredictable now\n\n5.

Compare to their historical behavior:\n   - First scissors streak: 4 rounds, then broke to rock\n   - Paper streak: 3 rounds, then broke to scissors  \n   - Recent scissors streak: 3 rounds, then broke to rock\n   - They seem to break streaks after 3-4 repetitions\n\n4. Consider what this means:\n   - They might be learning my counter-strategy\n   - They could be setting up new patterns or becoming more unpredictable\n   - The timing of breaks might be getting more strategic\n\n5. Predict their next move (Round 20):\n   - They just succeeded with rock, so they might:\n     - Stick with rock (since it worked)\n     - Start a new rock streak (following their pattern of repetition)\n     - Switch to paper (continuing rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n     - Return to scissors\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock again: paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: paper wins (+1)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Since they just broke a pattern with rock and succeeded, they might either repeat rock or continue cycling. Paper beats rock (+3) and scissors (+1), only losing to paper. Given that rock just worked for them, paper seems like the best choice to counter a potential rock continuation.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 16-18: scissors, scissors, scissors (3-round streak)\n   - Round 19: rock (pattern break)\n   - Round 20: scissors (back to scissors)\n   - They seem to be alternating between scissors streaks and single-move breaks\n\n3. Consider what's happening:\n   - After breaking their scissors streak with rock, they immediately returned to scissors\n   - This could indicate they're comfortable with scissors as their \"default\" move\n   - Or they might be starting another scissors streak\n\n4. Compare to their historical behavior:\n   - They tend to play moves in streaks of 3-4 rounds\n   - They occasionally break patterns with single different moves\n   - Scissors appears to be their most frequent choice overall\n\n5. Predict their next move (Round 21):\n   - If they're starting a new scissors streak: scissors is very likely\n   - If they continue the break pattern: rock or paper might come next\n   - Given their history, scissors seems most probable\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors: paper wins (+1)\n   - If they play rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If they play paper: rock wins (+3)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Since they just returned to scissors after a single rock break, and given their strong historical preference for scissors streaks, they'll likely continue with scissors. Paper beats scissors and also covers rock well, so I should stick with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's recent pattern shift:\n   - Round 16-18: scissors streak (3 rounds)\n   - Round 19: rock (break)\n   - Round 20: scissors (return)\n   - Round 21: paper (new move)\n   - They're becoming less predictable and switching moves more frequently\n\n3. Consider what this paper choice means:\n   - They broke from their scissors tendency\n   - Paper might be their attempt to counter my frequent paper usage\n   - Or they could be starting a new pattern/streak with paper\n\n4. Evaluate their evolving strategy:\n   - They seem to be learning that I often play paper\n   - Playing paper against my paper creates ties (neutralizing my advantage)\n   - They might continue with paper or switch to something else\n\n5. Predict their next move (Round 22):\n   - If they stick with paper (to keep neutralizing me): tie again\n   - If they want to beat my expected paper: they need scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch from paper: they might play rock to beat potential scissors\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I win (+3 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I lose (-1 point)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Since they just played paper (possibly to counter my paper tendency) and might continue this strategy, I should switch to rock to beat their potential paper for +3 points. This breaks my predictable paper pattern and could yield high rewards.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the concerning pattern:\n   - Opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to be cycling through all three moves now\n   - More importantly, they're matching my moves more frequently (2 ties in a row)\n\n3. Consider what's happening:\n   - They might be reading my patterns and adapting\n   - The ties suggest they're either mirroring me or we're both becoming predictable\n   - Their sequence looks like: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (could be cycling)\n\n4. Identify the potential cycle:\n   - If they're following rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock pattern\n   - Next would be scissors (to continue the cycle)\n   - This would mean: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n5. Evaluate the situation:\n   - I've been too predictable with paper usage\n   - Recent ties show I need to break my patterns\n   - They might be cycling or trying to counter-predict me\n\n6. Predict their next move (Round 23):\n   - If following the cycle: scissors would be next\n   - If they're trying to mirror me: they might expect me to play scissors\n   - If they want to beat my potential scissors: they'd play rock\n\n7. Strategic decision: If they're following the rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle, then scissors is next, and paper beats scissors for +1. But if they're trying to counter-predict, this gets complicated. Given the cycle pattern seems most likely, I'll play paper to beat their expected scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

Confirm the opponent's cycling pattern:\n   - Recent opponent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This appears to be a rock-paper-scissors cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Wait, let me recheck: rock (round 19) \u2192 scissors (round 20) \u2192 paper (round 21) \u2192 rock (round 22) \u2192 scissors (round 23)\n   - Yes, they're cycling through: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Predict their next move (Round 24):\n   - Following the established cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper (next)\n   - They should play paper in round 24\n\n4. Evaluate my response to paper:\n   - If I play rock vs their paper: I win +3 points (rock beats paper)\n   - If I play scissors vs their paper: I lose -1 point (paper beats scissors)\n   - If I play paper vs their paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Consider the reliability of this pattern:\n   - The cycle has held for 5 consecutive rounds now\n   - This is their most consistent pattern yet\n   - Rock gives me the maximum reward (+3) if they continue the cycle\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - High reward (+3) if the pattern holds\n   - If they break the pattern, rock could lose to scissors (-1)\n   - But the pattern strength suggests they'll likely continue\n\n7. Strategic decision: Given the strong 5-round cycling pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), I should play rock to beat their expected paper move and gain the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] rock"
