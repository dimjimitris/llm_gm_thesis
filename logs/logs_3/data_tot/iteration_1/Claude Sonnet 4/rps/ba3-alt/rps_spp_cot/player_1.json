    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - But rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns\n   - Fresh players often start with rock (most common first move)\n   - Or they might choose randomly\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper has the potential for the highest gain (+3) if opponent chooses rock\n   - The penalty for losing with paper is moderate (-1)\n   - Since fresh players often start with rock, paper seems like a good opening move\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played scissors, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - My total score remains -5 points\n   - This is now the 5th tie out of 10 rounds\n\n2. Review the complete game pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: paper vs rock (I lost -3)\n   - Round 4: scissors vs rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 6: rock vs scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 7: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 8: paper vs scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 9: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 10: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n\n3. Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've tied on: paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - We're mirroring each other's thinking process\n   - This suggests we're both using similar strategic reasoning\n\n4. Consider my critical situation:\n   - At -5 points with 5 ties, I'm not making progress\n   - I need to break this mirroring pattern\n   - The opponent seems to be thinking one step ahead or parallel to me\n\n5. Look for opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: scissors, scissors, rock, scissors\n   - They seem to favor scissors lately (3 out of 4)\n   - But they break patterns when they sense I'm catching on\n\n6. Strategic breakthrough needed:\n   - I need to stop overthinking and second-guessing\n   - The opponent might expect me to overthink again\n   - Sometimes the best strategy is to pick the move that gives the highest expected value\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) and gives +3 against rock\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and gives +3 against paper  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) but only +1 against rock\n   - Given opponent's recent scissors preference, rock seems optimal\n   - Rock gives me the best chance at both +1 and +3 point wins\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is only -1\n\n[move] rock"

Decision reasoning:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) which covers if they repeat paper\n   - Scissors loses only -1 to paper, not the devastating -3\n   - If they switch back to rock (from their previous pattern), scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - Scissors gives me good coverage: beats rock (+1), loses only -1 to paper\n   - This limits downside while maintaining upside potential\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I lost -1 point\n   - My total score is now -7 + (-1) = -8 points\n   - Back to my lowest point again\n\n2. Review recent performance:\n   - Round 18: scissors vs rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 20: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n   - I'm 1-1-1 in the last 3 rounds, but still losing ground\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - Their sequence: rock, paper, paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 19 and 20)\n   - They might be settling into a paper strategy\n   - Or they could switch after two successful papers\n\n4. Consider the situation critically:\n   - At -8 points with 20 rounds played, I'm in deep trouble\n   - The opponent has been consistently outplaying me\n   - I need to stop the bleeding and find a way to win consistently\n\n5. Evaluate what beats paper:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - But I just lost with scissors vs paper, which contradicts the rules\n   - Let me reconfirm: \"paper beats scissors\" - so paper wins, scissors loses\n   - This means I need to play something that beats paper\n\n6. Check what beats paper in the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points!)\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - So ROCK beats paper, not scissors\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent just played paper twice in a row\n   - If they continue with paper: I should play rock (+3 points!)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+3 points!)\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - Rock gives me the maximum reward (+3) if they stick with their recent paper pattern\n   - Even if wrong, rock only loses -1 to scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Review the devastating recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: scissors vs rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 20: scissors vs paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 21: rock vs scissors (I lost -1)\n   - I've only won 1 out of the last 4 rounds\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - Their sequence: rock, paper, paper, scissors\n   - They're cycling through all moves and switching after 1-2 uses\n   - They seem to be successfully counter-predicting my choices\n\n4. Face the reality of my situation:\n   - At -9 points, I'm in an extremely deep hole\n   - The opponent has been consistently outmaneuvering me\n   - My pattern-recognition approach isn't working\n   - I need a fundamental strategy change\n\n5. Consider a simpler approach:\n   - Maybe I should stop trying to predict and just focus on damage control\n   - The asymmetric payoffs mean rock vs paper swings are \u00b13 points\n   - I should avoid moves that could result in -3 losses\n   - Focus on the \u00b11 point moves to limit damage\n\n6. Evaluate safer move options:\n   - Scissors vs rock: +1 if win, -1 if lose\n   - Paper vs scissors: +1 if win, -1 if lose  \n   - Rock vs paper: +3 if win, -3 if lose (high risk)\n   - The opponent just played scissors, they might switch\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent just played scissors after two papers\n   - They're showing variety and unpredictability\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: tie (0)\n   - Scissors gives me the best chance for +1 wins while avoiding -3 losses\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played scissors, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - My total score remains -9 points\n   - This is the 7th tie out of 22 rounds\n   - We're mirroring each other's thinking again\n\n2. Review my critical situation:\n   - At -9 points, I'm in an extremely deep hole\n   - 7 ties means I'm not capitalizing on opportunities to gain points\n   - The opponent has been consistently ahead of my strategy\n   - I need wins, not ties, to recover\n\n3. Analyze the pattern of ties:\n   - We've tied on all three moves multiple times\n   - This suggests we're using similar strategic reasoning\n   - The opponent might be thinking through the same logic I am\n   - I need to break out of this predictable thinking\n\n4. Consider opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Their moves: paper, paper, scissors, scissors\n   - They played each move twice in a row recently\n   - After two scissors, they might switch or continue the pattern\n\n5. Evaluate my desperation situation:\n   - At -9 points, I need high-value wins to have any chance\n   - The +3 point moves (rock beating paper) are my only path to recovery\n   - I can't afford to keep playing it safe with +1 moves\n   - I need to take calculated risks\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent switches from scissors to paper: rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If opponent stays with scissors: paper loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Given they played scissors twice, a switch to paper seems reasonable\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm so far behind that I must pursue +3 opportunities\n   - Rock gives me +3 if they switch to paper (likely after two scissors)\n   - Even if wrong and they play scissors, I only lose -1\n   - The risk/reward favors aggressive play at this deficit\n   - I can't win with conservative +1 moves from -9 points\n\n[move] rock"
