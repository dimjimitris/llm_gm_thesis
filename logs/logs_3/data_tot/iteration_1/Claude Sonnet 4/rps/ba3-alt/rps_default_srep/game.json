The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet.

Let me analyze the recent pattern:\n\n- Rounds 1-5: Scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n- Round 6: Rock (beat my paper for +3)\n- Round 7: Paper (beat my scissors for +1)\n\nMy opponent seems to have shifted from a pure scissors strategy to cycling through different moves. They might be:\n1. Now trying each move in sequence\n2. Adapting more strategically to counter my moves\n3. Using the profitable rock experience to explore other options\n\nFor round 8, I need to consider what they might play:\n- If they continue cycling: they played rock, then paper, so scissors might be next\n- If they return to their old favorite: scissors\n- If they repeat what just worked: paper again\n\nGiven that they just successfully used paper to beat my scissors, they might try paper again since it worked. If they play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper for +3 points - the highest reward in the game).\n\nAlternatively, if they're cycling through moves, scissors would be next, and I'd want paper.\n\nI think the higher probability is they'll either play paper again (since it just worked) or return to scissors (their historical preference). I'll go with rock to potentially get the big +3 point reward if they play paper.\n\n[move] Rock",
