The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent played scissors again, and my paper beat it for +1 point.\n\nThis is very interesting - after our scissors tie, they chose to play scissors again rather than switching. This suggests:\n\n1. They might be returning to their early-game scissors preference\n2. They're comfortable with scissors as their \"default\" move\n3. They may not be adapting as quickly to ties\n\nLooking at the broader pattern:\n- Early game: Heavy scissors preference (5 rounds)\n- Middle game: More mixed strategy \n- Recent rounds: Returning to scissors more frequently\n\nTheir scissors frequency seems to be increasing again. In the last few rounds:\n- Round 11: Scissors\n- Round 13: Scissors (tie with me)\n- Round 14: Scissors (just lost to my paper)\n\nThree scissors in the last four rounds suggests they may be reverting to their original strategy or have decided scissors is their preferred approach.\n\nIf this trend continues, I should continue with paper to exploit their apparent return to scissors preference. However, they just lost with scissors, so they might finally switch.\n\nBut given their historical pattern and recent scissors frequency, I think there's still a good chance they'll stick with scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"
