Paper and Scissors have smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their intuition. Many people instinctively choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy that would give me the maximum 3 points.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that Rock has the highest stakes - if I'm wrong, I lose 3 points.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In round 23, they played rock (as predicted), and I correctly played scissors to beat it.\n\nIf the pattern holds, paper should be next. To beat paper, I need rock (rock beats paper, giving me +3 points - the maximum reward).\n\nThis could push me to +5 points total if I'm right!\n\n[move] (Pattern shows paper next - rock beats paper for maximum points) rock",
