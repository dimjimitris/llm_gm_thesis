    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people intuitively start with Rock (it feels strong) or Paper (it's the first option mentioned).\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and a new player might be drawn to Paper as a \"safe\" choice, I'll go with Rock to potentially capitalize on this with the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] Rock"

My opponent chose Scissors in the first round. This could mean:\n1. They're playing randomly\n2. They anticipated I might play Rock (which happened)\n3. They have some preference for Scissors\n\nSince this is only the second round, I don't have enough data to detect a clear pattern yet. However, I should consider that they might stick with Scissors again (some players repeat winning moves) or they might switch.\n\nGiven the payoff structure, I want to maximize my chances of getting points while minimizing risk. If they play Scissors again, I should play Rock to get +1. If they switch to Rock, I should play Paper to get +3. If they switch to Paper, I should play Scissors to get +1.\n\nSince Rock gives me the potential for +1 against Scissors, and Paper gives me the highest reward (+3) against Rock, I'll go with Paper this time. This protects against Rock (which some players switch to after using Scissors) and gives me the maximum possible reward if they do.\n\n[move] Paper"
