    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (scissors gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (paper gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (rock gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They might not know the asymmetric scoring system\n   - They might play randomly or go with a common first choice\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I lose badly (-3 points)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I win big (+3 points)\n   - If I play scissors, I can beat rock (+1) but lose to paper (-1)\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand the scoring asymmetry, and rock is a common first choice, playing paper could be risky due to the -3 penalty.\n\n6. Playing scissors seems like a reasonable choice because:\n   - If they play rock (common first move), I win +1\n   - If they play paper, I only lose -1 (not as bad as the -3 penalty)\n   - The risk/reward seems more balanced\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to potentially counter a rock play while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] scissors"

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose paper as their first move\n   - This could indicate they understand the game mechanics, or it was coincidental\n   - They might have been thinking strategically about countering common first moves\n\n3. Consider their potential next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked\n   - They might switch thinking I'll adjust to counter paper\n   - They might try rock to go for the high-value +3 points win\n   - They could play randomly\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they played paper last round, they might expect me to counter with scissors again\n   - Or they might expect me to switch to rock to counter their potential paper\n   - Playing rock is high risk (-3 if they play paper) but high reward (+3 if they play scissors)\n\n6. Decision: I'll play rock this round because:\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I might play paper), I get +3\n   - It's a calculated risk for a potentially high reward\n   - They might not expect the aggressive high-stakes move\n\n[move] rock"

Critical realization:\n   - My opponent has now achieved perfect balance: each move used exactly 3 times\n   - This suggests they're either very strategic about maintaining balance, or it's coincidental\n   - They seem to be playing a mixed strategy rather than being predictable\n\n4. My own pattern analysis:\n   - I've played: scissors (4), rock (4), paper (1)\n   - I'm heavily underusing paper and overusing scissors and rock\n   - My opponent might have noticed this imbalance\n\n5. Performance assessment:\n   - I'm at -3 points and consistently losing\n   - My prediction-based approach isn't working well\n   - This opponent seems skilled and unpredictable\n\n6. New strategy for round 10:\n   - Since my opponent maintains perfect balance, prediction is very difficult\n   - I should focus on my own balance and risk management\n   - Paper is my least-used move (only 1 time vs 4 each for scissors/rock)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) and loses to rock (-3)\n   - Given the opponent's balance, each move is equally likely\n   - I'll use paper to balance my own strategy and see if it helps\n\n[move] paper"

Correct rule analysis:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 points)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 points)\n   - So if they favor paper, I should play ROCK to win +3\n\n6. Decision for round 18:\n   - Their clear paper preference (7/17, significantly more than rock/scissors at 5 each)\n   - Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 reward\n   - This is a high-reward opportunity if their paper pattern continues\n   - Even if wrong, rock only loses -1 to scissors (not catastrophic)\n\n[move] rock"

Update my complete game history:\n   - Previous total after round 17: +1 points\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost -1\n   - Current total score: 0 points (back to even)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Rounds 1-18: Paper (7), Rock (5), Scissors (6)\n   - Paper still leads at 7, scissors now at 6, rock remains at 5\n   - They played scissors when I expected them to continue their paper preference\n\n3. Strategic insights:\n   - Just when I thought I identified their paper pattern, they switched to scissors\n   - They might be deliberately breaking patterns when they become too obvious\n   - Or they could be balancing back toward scissors after paper got ahead\n   - This opponent is very sophisticated - they adapt and avoid being predictable\n\n4. Pattern evolution analysis:\n   - Their distribution is now 7-6-5 (paper-scissors-rock)\n   - Rock is their least-used move, which might make it due for balancing\n   - But predicting based on balance hasn't been consistently successful\n\n5. My own performance review:\n   - I'm back to 0 points after being at +2\n   - I've been making prediction errors on the rules (paper beats scissors, not vice versa)\n   - I need to focus more on correct rule application than pattern prediction\n\n6. Decision for round 19:\n   - Given their sophistication and adaptability, pure prediction is risky\n   - I should focus on moves with good risk/reward ratios\n   - Scissors has moderate reward (+1 vs both paper and rock) and moderate risk (-1 vs paper)\n   - Paper has high risk (-3 vs rock) but decent reward (+1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock has high reward (+3 vs paper) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - I'll play scissors for its balanced risk/reward profile\n\n[move] scissors"

Current distribution analysis:\n   - Their pattern: Paper (7), Scissors (6), Rock (6)\n   - If they continue balancing, they might play scissors or rock to catch up to paper\n   - Or they might play paper again since it's been their most successful move\n\n5. My usage pattern:\n   - After 19 rounds: Scissors (8), Rock (7), Paper (4)\n   - I'm still significantly underusing paper and overusing scissors\n   - But scissors has been working well recently\n\n6.

Key strategic insights:\n   - My read on their paper preference was correct this time\n   - They do seem to have a genuine tendency toward paper (8/20 = 40% usage)\n   - Rock vs paper giving +3 has been my most profitable play when I get it right\n   - This is my second +3 win (rounds 12 and 20, both rock vs paper)\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis of my recent success:\n   - Both of my +3 wins came from correctly predicting their paper usage\n   - Paper is clearly their most-used move (8 vs 6 each for others)\n   - But they're sophisticated enough to break patterns when they become obvious\n\n5. Current momentum assessment:\n   - I'm at +4 points, my highest score yet\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds with good strategic reads\n   - The opponent might adjust after giving me another big +3 loss\n\n6. Decision for round 21:\n   - After losing -3 twice to my rock, they might avoid paper temporarily\n   - They could switch to scissors or rock to counter potential rock plays from me\n   - If they expect me to play rock again (chasing the +3), they might play scissors\n   - I should consider playing paper to counter potential scissors\n   - Or play scissors to beat potential rock\n   - Given they just lost big, they might play more defensively - scissors seems reasonable to counter rock\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategic insights after the big win:\n   - After my +3 win in round 20, they shifted away from paper to scissors\n   - This confirms they do adapt after big losses\n   - They might be becoming more cautious about their paper preference\n\n5. Current distribution trends:\n   - Paper (8), Scissors (7), Rock (6) - still showing paper preference but narrowing\n   - If they continue balancing, rock might be due (it's their least-used at 6)\n   - But they might also continue avoiding paper after the recent -3 loss\n\n6.
