    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but symmetric payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often default to Rock as it's psychologically appealing due to its strength association.\n\nHowever, I should consider that Rock's high reward makes it tempting, but also risky. If my opponent also chooses Rock thinking the same way, it's a tie with 0 points.\n\nFor my opening move against a fresh player, I'll go with Paper. This beats Rock (which new players often favor) and gives me a solid +3 points if I'm right about their likely choice.\n\n[move] Paper"

Recent sequence shows the cycling pattern:\n- Round 21: Scissors (tied)\n- Round 22: Paper (won +1)\n- Round 23: Rock (tied)\n\nThey went from a tie to a win to another tie. Since we just tied on Rock, and following their pattern of switching after ties, they'll likely move away from Rock.\n\nBetween Scissors and Paper:\n- Scissors: tied for most used (39.1%), their comfort zone\n- Paper: has been working well recently, won in round 22\n\nGiven that Paper just gave them a win in round 22 and they seem to be using it more strategically now, they might return to it. But Scissors is still tied as their most-used move.\n\nLooking at their post-tie behavior:\n- After round 10 tie (Paper), they went Scissors\n- After round 16 tie (Paper), they went Scissors  \n- After round 21 tie (Scissors), they went Paper\n- After round 23 tie (Rock), they'll likely go to ?\n\nThey tend to switch to a different move after ties. Since we just tied on Rock, and they've been cycling between all three moves more evenly, I think Scissors is most likely - it's their comfort zone and tied for most used.\n\nIf they go Scissors, my Paper wins +1.\nIf they go Paper, my Rock wins +3.\nIf they repeat Rock, we tie again.\n\nGoing with Paper to counter likely Scissors:\n\n[move] Paper"
