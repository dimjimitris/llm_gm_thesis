I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain points.\n\n6. However, if they're truly random or choose paper, my rock would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n7. Given that rock offers the highest potential reward and beginners often don't expect aggressive high-reward plays, I should go with rock to maximize my potential points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially gain the maximum +3 points if my opponent plays paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock again, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper (to counter their scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they're playing randomly, any move has equal probability\n\n4. Payoff analysis for my options:\n   - If I play paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - If I play rock: beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I play scissors: beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5.

Since they just won with scissors, they might be tempted to repeat it, thinking I'll stick with rock or switch to something else.

Opponent's pattern observation:\n   - The opponent has played scissors twice in a row\n   - This could indicate they have a preference for scissors, or they're trying to establish a pattern\n\n3.

Opponent's move sequence analysis:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - They returned to scissors after the rock\n   - This could indicate scissors is their preferred/default choice\n   - Or they might be trying to establish a pattern to confuse me\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent has played scissors 3 out of 4 times\n   - The one deviation was rock (when I also played rock)\n   - This suggests either a strong preference for scissors or a deliberate strategy\n\n4. Possible opponent psychology:\n   - They might feel comfortable with scissors as their \"go-to\" move\n   - They could be testing if I'll adapt to their scissors frequency\n   - They might switch now, thinking I've caught on to their scissors preference\n   - They could be playing a mixed strategy with scissors bias\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: rock ties (0), paper loses (-3), scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: paper ties (0), rock wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n6.

Statistical insight:\n   - This opponent clearly has a very strong preference for scissors\n   - Even when I've been winning with paper against their scissors, they continue playing scissors\n   - This suggests either: they're not adapting strategically, they're committed to a scissors-heavy strategy, or they're setting up for a big switch\n\n4.

Opponent's confirmed pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock FOUR times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - This is an extremely strong commitment to rock strategy\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - The opponent has completely shifted to a rock-dominant strategy\n   - They're not just playing phases - they've found a strategy that works\n   - Rock has given them two +3 victories against my paper\n   - They're likely to continue this successful pattern\n\n4. My strategic mistakes analysis:\n   - I've been trying to counter-predict instead of simply countering their obvious pattern\n   - I played paper twice against their rock streak and lost -6 points total\n   - I need to directly counter rock with scissors, not overthink it\n\n5. Opponent psychology:\n   - They've discovered that rock is very profitable (+3 points when it wins)\n   - They might be committed to this strategy since it's working\n   - After four rocks in a row, they might switch, but the pattern is too strong to ignore\n   - They're probably expecting me to continue trying to counter with paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: scissors ties (0), manageable outcome\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors loses (-1), but this seems least likely\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors directly counters their dominant rock strategy\n   - Even if they switch, scissors has limited downside (-1 max)\n   - I need to stop the bleeding from their rock strategy\n\n8. The pattern is so strong (4 rocks in a row) that I must directly counter it rather than try to outthink them.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to directly counter their established rock pattern and stop giving them easy +3 victories.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current total: -3 points\n\n2. Opponent's incredible pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock FIVE times in a row (rounds 6-10)\n   - This is an extraordinarily strong commitment to rock\n\n3. Success with direct countering:\n   - When I played scissors against their rock (rounds 7 and 10), I won both times (+1 each)\n   - When I played paper against their rock (rounds 6 and 9), I lost both times (-3 each)\n   - Direct countering with scissors is clearly the winning strategy\n\n4. Opponent psychology assessment:\n   - Despite losing twice to my scissors, they continued with rock\n   - This suggests either: they're very committed to rock strategy, they're not adapting well, or they're setting up for a major switch\n   - Five rocks in a row is almost unprecedented - they might finally switch\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (sixth in a row): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat my successful scissors): rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors  \n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n\n7. Critical decision point:\n   - Their pattern is so extreme (5 rocks) that they might finally break it\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to continue scissors), rock would give me +3\n   - However, if they stick with their pattern, scissors gives me another +1\n   - The question is: do I play it safe with scissors or gamble on rock for the big payoff?\n\n8. Given that they've been so stubbornly committed to rock despite losses, and the pattern is so strong, I think they're more likely to continue than to make a strategic switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to continue exploiting their rock obsession, as the pattern is too strong to abandon the winning strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current total: -2 points\n\n2. Opponent's extraordinary pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock SIX times in a row (rounds 6-11)\n   - This is beyond any reasonable strategic variation - it's almost compulsive\n\n3. My recent success:\n   - Last 3 times I played scissors against their rock: won all 3 times (+3 points total)\n   - The direct counter strategy is working perfectly\n   - I've recovered from -5 points to -2 points using this approach\n\n4. Statistical analysis:\n   - 6 rocks in a row has probability of (1/3)^6 = 1/729 if random\n   - This is clearly not random - it's either a deliberate strategy or a behavioral pattern\n   - They're giving me free points by being so predictable\n\n5. Opponent psychology deep dive:\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern and unable to break it\n   - They could be testing my adaptation - seeing if I'll stick with scissors\n   - They might finally switch after 6 consecutive losses to scissors\n   - Or they're so committed to rock that they'll continue despite evidence\n\n6. Critical strategic decision:\n   - Continue with scissors (safe +1 if they play rock again)\n   - Switch to rock (risky +3 if they finally play paper, but -1 if they stick with rock)\n   - The pattern is so extreme that a switch seems overdue\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has been my winning move for 3 straight rounds\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat scissors), I lose -1\n   - If they switch to scissors, we tie at 0\n   - If they somehow continue with rock (7th time!), I win +1 again\n\n8. The pattern is so absurd that they're either completely predictable or about to make a major switch. Given that they've lost 3 times in a row to my scissors and still played rock, they seem truly committed to this strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with scissors one more time to exploit this incredible rock pattern, as they seem unable or unwilling to adapt.\n\n[move] scissors"

Opponent's mind-boggling pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock SEVEN times in a row (rounds 6-12)\n   - This defies all reasonable game theory and strategic thinking\n\n3. My incredible success streak:\n   - Last 4 times playing scissors against their rock: won all 4 (+4 points)\n   - I've completely neutralized their early advantage\n   - They're literally giving me free points at this stage\n\n4. Statistical impossibility analysis:\n   - 7 rocks in a row has probability of (1/3)^7 = 1/2187 if random\n   - This is clearly a deliberate choice or psychological fixation\n   - No rational player would continue this pattern after 4 consecutive losses\n\n5. Opponent psychology - this is beyond normal strategy:\n   - They might be completely locked into rock mentally\n   - They could be testing if I'll ever switch away from the winning scissors\n   - They might be playing some meta-game I don't understand\n   - Or they're simply not adapting at all to feedback\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock (almost guaranteed at this point), 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n\n7. The decision dilemma:\n   - Their pattern is so extreme that a switch seems mathematically inevitable\n   - But they've defied logic for 7 rounds straight\n   - If they switch to paper (finally countering scissors), rock gives me +3\n   - If they somehow play rock an 8th time, scissors gives me another +1\n\n8. At this point, their behavior suggests they may never switch from rock. The pattern is so strong and they've ignored all negative feedback. While a switch to paper seems logical, their behavior has been anything but logical.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with scissors because their rock fixation appears unbreakable, and I should keep exploiting this gift of free points.\n\n[move] scissors"

Pattern comparison:\n   - Previous: 7 rocks in a row, then switched to paper\n   - Current: 3 papers in a row after the rock phase\n   - They seem to commit deeply to single moves for extended periods\n\n4.

Opponent's extraordinary pattern:\n   - They've now played paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 13, 14, 15, 16)\n   - I've won +9 points from their last three paper plays with rock\n   - This mirrors their previous 7-rock streak but with even higher rewards for me\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Previous phase: 7 rocks in a row\n   - Current phase: 4 papers in a row and counting\n   - They seem to have completely shifted strategies but maintained the same pattern-heavy approach\n\n4. My exploitation success:\n   - Rock vs their paper has been perfectly successful\n   - I've gained +9 points in just 3 rounds\n   - This is the most profitable streak I've had in the entire game\n   - They're literally giving me maximum points repeatedly\n\n5. Opponent psychology deep dive:\n   - They seem incapable of quick adaptation\n   - They commit to strategies for very long periods\n   - Even massive losses don't immediately change their behavior\n   - They might be testing if I'll ever switch away from rock\n\n6.

Opponent's pattern break analysis:\n   - After 4 consecutive papers, they finally switched to scissors\n   - This matches their previous behavior: long pattern then strategic switch\n   - They broke their rock pattern at 7 rounds, broke paper pattern at 4 rounds\n   - The switch came right when I was maximally exploiting their pattern\n\n3. Strategic parallel to earlier game:\n   - Previously: 7 rocks \u2192 paper (to counter my scissors)\n   - Now: 4 papers \u2192 scissors (to counter my rock)\n   - They seem to learn from patterns and make calculated switches\n\n4. Opponent sophistication revealed again:\n   - They allowed me to gain +9 points to establish my rock habit\n   - Then switched to scissors at the perfect moment\n   - This shows advanced strategic thinking and patience\n   - They sacrifice short-term losses for strategic positioning\n\n5. What this tells me about their next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors, thinking I'll stick with rock\n   - They could return to paper, expecting me to switch to paper (to beat scissors)\n   - They might play rock, expecting me to switch to scissors\n   - They've shown they can maintain new patterns after switches\n\n6. Strategic options analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If they return to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0), scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins (+1), rock ties (0), paper loses (-3)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats scissors and ties with paper, only losing badly to rock\n   - Given they just switched to scissors successfully, they might repeat it\n   - Or they might expect me to adapt and switch back to paper\n   - Paper seems like the safest counter to their likely scissors continuation\n\n8.

Opponent's current pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors TWO times in a row (rounds 17, 18)\n   - This follows their established behavior of committing to patterns\n   - Previous phases: 7 rocks, then 4 papers, now starting scissors phase\n   - My paper successfully countered their scissors for +1 point\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds  \n   - Scissors phase: 2 rounds so far\n   - They seem to be getting shorter phases but still maintaining patterns\n\n4. Strategic success analysis:\n   - I correctly predicted they'd continue scissors after the switch\n   - Paper beat their scissors as planned\n   - They might continue the scissors pattern or make another switch\n   - Their behavior suggests pattern continuation for at least a few more rounds\n\n5.

Opponent's scissors pattern confirmation:\n   - They've now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 17, 18, 19)\n   - This confirms they're in a \"scissors phase\" like their previous phases\n   - Pattern history: 7 rocks \u2192 4 papers \u2192 3+ scissors\n   - My paper has successfully countered for +2 points in last 2 rounds\n\n3. Phase length analysis:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds (very long)\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds (medium)\n   - Scissors phase: 3 rounds so far (and continuing?)\n   - The phases seem to be getting progressively shorter\n\n4. My counter-strategy success:\n   - Paper vs scissors has worked perfectly for 2 consecutive wins\n   - I'm back to +8 points total, recovering well from earlier losses\n   - The direct counter approach is clearly effective against their patterns\n\n5. Opponent decision point assessment:\n   - They might continue scissors, maintaining their pattern behavior\n   - They could switch after 3 losses, but their history shows longer commitments\n   - Their rock phase lasted through multiple losses, so scissors might continue\n   - They seem to need several losses before breaking patterns\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again (4th time): paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\n7. Risk evaluation:\n   - Paper has been consistently profitable against their scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests continuation is more likely than switching\n   - Even if they switch, the maximum loss with paper is -3 against rock\n   - The +1 steady gains are adding up nicely\n\n8. Their commitment to patterns has been their defining characteristic. With only 3 scissors plays so far, and given their history of longer patterns, they're likely to continue scissors for at least another round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with paper to continue exploiting their scissors pattern.\n\n[move] (Exploiting their scissors pattern) paper"

Opponent's scissors streak:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row (rounds 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - This matches the length of their previous paper phase\n   - My paper has perfectly countered for +3 points in the last 3 rounds\n   - Their pattern commitment remains incredibly strong\n\n3. Phase comparison:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds (longest)\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds (medium)\n   - Scissors phase: 4 rounds so far (matching paper phase length)\n   - They might be settling into consistent 4-round phases after the initial rock phase\n\n4. Strategic success tracking:\n   - I'm now at +9 points total, my highest score yet\n   - Paper vs scissors strategy has been flawless\n   - I've recovered completely from all earlier losses\n   - The direct counter approach continues to work perfectly\n\n5. Critical decision point:\n   - Their scissors phase now matches their paper phase length (4 rounds)\n   - They might switch after 4 rounds like they did from paper to scissors\n   - Or they might continue since they've shown they can go longer (7 rocks)\n   - This could be the moment they break the pattern\n\n6. Pattern break risk assessment:\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper): I lose -3\n   - If they switch to paper: we tie at 0\n   - If they continue scissors: I win +1 again\n   - The risk of a switch is higher now after 4 consecutive losses\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper continues to beat scissors but risks -3 against rock\n   - Rock would win +3 against paper if they switch\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors or beat rock\n   - Given their switching pattern history, they might change now\n\n8. They switched from paper to scissors after 4 rounds of paper. Now they've played 4 rounds of scissors. This could be their switching point, and if they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper), I should anticipate that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to potentially counter a rock switch, while accepting a tie if they continue scissors.\n\n[move] (Anticipating potential switch after 4 scissors) scissors"

Pattern shift analysis:\n   - Opponent broke their 4-round scissors pattern by switching to rock\n   - This mirrors their previous behavior: 4 papers \u2192 scissors, now 4 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - My prediction was correct - they switched after exactly 4 rounds\n   - I successfully countered their switch with scissors for +1 point\n\n3. Emerging meta-pattern recognition:\n   - Phase 1: 7 rocks (initial long phase)\n   - Phase 2: 4 papers (standardized length)  \n   - Phase 3: 4 scissors (standardized length)\n   - Phase 4: Rock (just started)\n   - They seem to have settled into 4-round phases after the initial long rock phase\n\n4. Strategic insight breakthrough:\n   - They appear to cycle through moves in 4-round phases now\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (cycling pattern)\n   - I correctly anticipated the switch timing and move choice\n   - This suggests a predictable cycle I can exploit\n\n5. Current position assessment:\n   - I'm at +10 points, my highest score of the entire game\n   - My pattern recognition and adaptation has been excellent\n   - I've successfully countered their last several strategic moves\n   - They might continue with rock for 3 more rounds based on their pattern\n\n6. Strategic options for rock phase:\n   - If they continue rock (round 2 of 4): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they break pattern early: depends on their choice\n   - If they maintain 4-round commitment: paper is optimal for next 3 rounds\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives +3 against rock (maximum reward)\n   - Paper only loses -1 to scissors, manageable risk\n   - If they're starting a rock phase, paper is the perfect counter\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll commit to rock for multiple rounds\n\n8. Given their established 4-round phase pattern and the fact that they just started with rock, they're likely to continue rock for at least 2-3 more rounds.

Wait - analyzing the result:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - Rock beats paper, so opponent should have won +3 and I should have lost -3\n   - But the hint says I lost -3 points, which means rock beat paper\n   - This is correct - rock beats paper for +3 to opponent, -3 to me\n\n3. Corrected pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has now played rock TWO times in a row (rounds 21, 22)\n   - They seem to be in a rock phase as I predicted\n   - However, my paper lost to their rock, not won\n   - I need to counter rock with scissors, not paper\n\n4.

Key insight from the last move:\n   - They switched from scissors to rock right when I was exploiting their scissors pattern\n   - This indicates they may be more strategic than initially apparent\n   - They might have been setting up the scissors pattern to lure me into paper\n\n4. Possible opponent strategy analysis:\n   - They might alternate between scissors-heavy periods and strategic switches\n   - They could be reading my adaptations and counter-adapting\n   - The rock choice gave them +3 points, so they might try rock again\n   - Or they might return to scissors, thinking I'll switch away from paper\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Opponent's move sequence analysis:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - They seem to favor scissors (3 out of 4 times)\n   - They briefly switched to rock but returned to scissors\n   - This suggests scissors might be their preferred/default choice\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - The opponent appears to have a strong bias toward scissors\n   - They only deviated once (to rock in round 3)\n   - This could be intentional strategy or unconscious preference\n\n4. Opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might be sticking with what they know works\n   - They could be testing if I'll adapt to their scissors preference\n   - They might think I won't expect another scissors after the tie\n   - Random play seems less likely given the clear scissors bias\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again (likely): paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: rock wins (+3), paper loses (-3), scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: scissors wins (+1), rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\n6. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - Paper has the best chance against their likely scissors choice (+1)\n   - Rock offers high reward (+3) but high risk (-1) against their preferred scissors\n   - Given their clear scissors tendency, paper is the logical counter\n\n7. The opponent has shown scissors 3 out of 4 times, with only one deviation. Playing paper capitalizes on this pattern while minimizing risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their apparent scissors preference for a +1 gain.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic decision framework:\n   - Against scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If they suddenly switch: need to consider rock (+3 vs paper) or paper (counters rock)\n   - Given 80% scissors rate, paper has very high expected value\n\n6.

Opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock\n   - They've now played rock twice, both times when I played rock or paper consecutively\n   - The rock plays seem strategic - round 3 when I played rock, round 6 after I won twice with paper\n\n3. Strategic insight about opponent:\n   - They're not as predictable as I thought\n   - They seem to adapt when I establish a pattern\n   - They switched to rock right after I successfully used paper twice\n   - This suggests they are observing and countering my successful strategies\n\n4. Opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They probably noticed I was exploiting their scissors with paper\n   - Playing rock was a smart counter to my paper success\n   - They might expect me to either stick with paper or switch to scissors to beat rock\n\n5. What they might expect from me now:\n   - Continue with paper (stubborn/pattern following)\n   - Switch to scissors to beat their rock\n   - Switch to rock for the high-value play\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3), rock ties (0)\n   - If opponent returns to scissors: paper wins (+1), rock loses (-1), scissors ties (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper: rock wins (+3), scissors loses (-1), paper ties (0)\n\n7. Risk/reward consideration:\n   - They just made a successful adaptation, so they might stick with rock\n   - But they could return to their scissors preference\n   - Playing scissors would beat rock (+1) and tie with scissors (0), only losing to paper (-1)\n   - This has good risk/reward profile given their demonstrated adaptability\n\n8. The opponent has shown they can counter my successful patterns, so I should play scissors to counter their rock adaptation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat rock, assuming they'll either stick with their successful rock or I'll tie if they return to scissors.\n\n[move] scissors",

Strategic shift analysis:\n   - After I successfully exploited their scissors pattern with paper, they switched to rock\n   - After rock worked once (-3 for me), they're continuing with rock\n   - They might be establishing rock as their new default, just like scissors before\n\n5. Opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might continue with rock since it's been working (tie, then +3, then -1 but still rock)\n   - They could switch back to scissors thinking I'll keep playing scissors to counter rock\n   - They might play paper if they expect me to switch to rock for the +3 potential\n\n6.

Risk/reward consideration:\n   - Scissors just worked against their rock, and they might stick with rock\n   - However, they might anticipate my scissors and switch to paper\n   - Playing rock would give massive +3 if they switch to paper, but -1 if they return to scissors\n   - The opponent seems to be in a \"rock phase\" similar to their earlier \"scissors phase\"\n\n8.

Opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock 3 times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8)\n   - This shows a clear shift from scissors-heavy to rock-heavy strategy\n\n3. Phase analysis of opponent behavior:\n   - Phase 1 (rounds 1-2): Scissors preference\n   - Phase 2 (rounds 3-5): Mixed with scissors returning\n   - Phase 3 (rounds 6-8): Rock preference emerging and strengthening\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent appears to be adapting and learning\n   - They discovered rock's +3 potential in round 6\n   - Despite one loss with rock (round 7), they're persisting with it\n   - Three rocks in a row suggests they might be committed to this strategy\n\n5. Psychological considerations:\n   - They might continue with rock, believing in its high-reward potential\n   - They could switch after three rocks, thinking I'll adapt with paper\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock trend\n   - The tie in round 8 gives them no penalty, so rock might seem \"safe\"\n\n6. Strategic options analysis:\n   - If they play rock again: paper wins (+1), rock ties (0), scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: scissors ties (0), paper wins (+1), rock loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0), scissors loses (-1)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats their recent rock preference (+1) but risks -3 against potential rock\n   - Wait, that's wrong - paper beats rock, so no -3 risk there\n   - Paper beats rock (+1), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Given their 3-rock streak, paper seems like the logical counter\n\n8. Expected value calculation:\n   - Their rock frequency in recent rounds is very high\n   - Paper would capitalize on this trend with +1 points\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose -1 (not the devastating -3)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter their established rock pattern, with good risk management.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has clearly adapted and is now favoring rock\n   - They might be committed to this rock strategy after initial success\n   - Or they could be ready to switch again after the tie\n\n5.

Pattern-based prediction:\n   - They've played rock 3 times in a row, showing commitment to this strategy\n   - However, the last round was a tie, which might prompt them to switch\n   - If they think I'll continue trying to counter their rock with scissors, they might play paper\n\n8. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors has been working against their rock pattern (+1 in round 7)\n   - Paper would give +1 against scissors but risks -3 against rock\n   - Rock would give +3 against paper but only ties against their frequent rock\n\n9. Given their strong rock trend and my success with scissors against rock, but considering they might switch to paper to counter my expected scissors, I need to think one level deeper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to continue exploiting their rock preference, as they've shown commitment to this pattern and the +1 payoff is consistent.\n\n[move] scissors",

Success with direct countering:\n   - When I played scissors against their rock (rounds 7 and 10), I won both times (+1 each)\n   - When I played paper against their rock (rounds 6 and 9), I lost both times (-3 each)\n   - Direct countering with scissors is clearly the winning strategy\n\n4. Opponent psychology assessment:\n   - Despite losing twice to my scissors, they continued with rock\n   - This suggests either: they're very committed to rock strategy, they're not adapting well, or they're setting up for a major switch\n   - Five rocks in a row is almost unprecedented - they might finally switch\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (sixth in a row): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat my successful scissors): rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors  \n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n\n7. Critical decision point:\n   - Their pattern is so extreme (5 rocks) that they might finally break it\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to continue scissors), rock would give me +3\n   - However, if they stick with their pattern, scissors gives me another +1\n   - The question is: do I play it safe with scissors or gamble on rock for the big payoff?\n\n8. Given that they've been so stubbornly committed to rock despite losses, and the pattern is so strong, I think they're more likely to continue than to make a strategic switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to continue exploiting their rock obsession, as the pattern is too strong to abandon the winning strategy.\n\n[move] scissors",

Key insights:\n   - My scissors strategy is working - I've won twice when using it against their rock\n   - They are incredibly persistent with their rock strategy\n   - Even after losing to my scissors, they continued with rock\n   - This suggests either stubborn commitment or they believe rock is still optimal\n\n4.

Pattern probability assessment:\n   - 5 rocks in a row is statistically very unlikely if playing randomly\n   - This is clearly a deliberate strategy, not random play\n   - They've earned +6 points from rock wins and lost -2 points from rock losses\n   - Net +4 points from their rock strategy makes it profitable for them\n\n6.

Success of my counter-strategy:\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock twice now (rounds 7 and 10)\n   - Each time I play scissors against their rock, I gain +1 point\n   - This is the most reliable way to score against this opponent\n\n5.

My successful counter-strategy:\n   - Last 3 times I played scissors against their rock: won all 3 times (+3 total)\n   - I've now identified the perfect counter to their strategy\n   - They're giving me consistent +1 points with their rock persistence\n\n4. Statistical analysis:\n   - 6 rocks in a row is extremely unusual behavior\n   - Even the most stubborn player would typically switch after multiple losses\n   - This suggests either: complete lack of adaptation, a trap being set, or genuine commitment to rock-only strategy\n\n5. Opponent psychology deep dive:\n   - They've lost 3 times in a row to my scissors but haven't switched\n   - They seem completely locked into rock despite clear evidence it's not working\n   - They might be waiting for me to switch away from scissors before they change\n\n6. Strategic decision analysis:\n   - If they play rock AGAIN (7th time): scissors wins (+1) - almost guaranteed based on pattern\n   - If they finally switch to paper: scissors loses (-1) - they would need to predict my scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors: tie (0) - neutral outcome\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has won 3 straight times against their rock\n   - The pattern is so strong that deviating seems unwise\n   - Even if they switch, scissors only risks -1 against paper\n   - The expected value strongly favors scissors given their behavior\n\n8. At this point, their rock pattern is so established and profitable for me that I should continue exploiting it until they prove they can adapt.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to exploit their incredible rock commitment - six in a row suggests they'll likely make it seven.\n\n[move] scissors",

My recent success:\n   - Last 3 times I played scissors against their rock: won all 3 times (+3 points total)\n   - The direct counter strategy is working perfectly\n   - I've recovered from -5 points to -2 points using this approach\n\n4. Statistical analysis:\n   - 6 rocks in a row has probability of (1/3)^6 = 1/729 if random\n   - This is clearly not random - it's either a deliberate strategy or a behavioral pattern\n   - They're giving me free points by being so predictable\n\n5.

Critical strategic decision:\n   - Continue with scissors (safe +1 if they play rock again)\n   - Switch to rock (risky +3 if they finally play paper, but -1 if they stick with rock)\n   - The pattern is so extreme that a switch seems overdue\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has been my winning move for 3 straight rounds\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat scissors), I lose -1\n   - If they switch to scissors, we tie at 0\n   - If they somehow continue with rock (7th time!), I win +1 again\n\n8. The pattern is so absurd that they're either completely predictable or about to make a major switch.

Current situation analysis:\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - I gained +9 points during their paper phase but just lost -1\n   - Net gain is still +8 points from recent rounds\n   - They might continue scissors or start a new pattern\n\n6. Possible opponent next moves:\n   - Continue scissors (starting a scissors phase)\n   - Return to paper (thinking I'll switch from rock)\n   - Play rock (expecting me to counter scissors with paper)\n   - Begin random/mixed strategy\n\n7.

Given their pattern of establishing phases, they might be starting a scissors phase now. However, they could also return to paper thinking I'll abandon my successful rock strategy.

Decision point considerations:\n   - Their scissors phase now matches their paper phase length (4 rounds)\n   - They might switch soon like they did after 4 papers\n   - Or they might continue longer, like their 7-round rock phase\n   - The pattern could break at any moment\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue scissors (5th time): paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\n8. Given that their scissors phase has now reached 4 rounds (same as their paper phase), they might be approaching a switch point. However, their rock phase lasted 7 rounds, so they could continue longer. The safe play is to continue exploiting their pattern while it lasts.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with paper to exploit their scissors pattern, but I'm aware they might switch soon.\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit scissors pattern) paper",

Current strategic position:\n   - Opponent seems to be in a rock phase (2 rocks in a row)\n   - If they continue rock pattern like their previous phases, I should counter with scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 points\n   - This would be the direct counter strategy that worked before\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again (3rd time): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0)\n\n7. Pattern-based prediction:\n   - Their recent behavior suggests 4-round phases\n   - They're potentially in round 2 of a rock phase\n   - Scissors should be the optimal counter for the next 2-3 rounds\n   - This follows the successful direct counter strategy\n\n8. Given their pattern of committing to moves for multiple rounds and the fact that they've played rock twice in a row, they're likely to continue with rock. Scissors is the direct counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their apparent rock phase.\n\n[move] (Countering their rock phase) scissors",
