Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain points.\n\n6. However, if they're truly random or choose paper, my rock would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n7. Given that rock offers the highest potential reward and beginners often don't expect aggressive high-reward plays, I should go with rock to maximize my potential points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially gain the maximum +3 points if my opponent plays paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock, so I lost and got -1 points\n   - This tells me the opponent either got lucky or might have anticipated my rock choice\n\n2.

Strategic considerations for this round:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock again, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to paper (to counter their scissors), they might play rock\n   - If they're playing randomly, any move has equal probability\n\n4. Payoff analysis for my options:\n   - If I play paper: beats scissors (+1), loses to rock (-3), ties with paper (0)\n   - If I play rock: beats paper (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I play scissors: beats rock (+1), loses to paper (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - Playing rock again risks another -1 if they repeat scissors\n   - Playing paper would beat scissors (+1) if they repeat their winning move\n   - Playing scissors would beat rock (+1) if they switch to counter my expected paper\n\n6.

Opponent's pattern observation:\n   - The opponent has played scissors twice in a row\n   - This could indicate they have a preference for scissors, or they're trying to establish a pattern\n\n3.

Opponent's move sequence analysis:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - They returned to scissors after the rock\n   - This could indicate scissors is their preferred/default choice\n   - Or they might be trying to establish a pattern to confuse me\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Opponent has played scissors 3 out of 4 times\n   - The one deviation was rock (when I also played rock)\n   - This suggests either a strong preference for scissors or a deliberate strategy\n\n4. Possible opponent psychology:\n   - They might feel comfortable with scissors as their \"go-to\" move\n   - They could be testing if I'll adapt to their scissors frequency\n   - They might switch now, thinking I've caught on to their scissors preference\n   - They could be playing a mixed strategy with scissors bias\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: rock ties (0), paper loses (-3), scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: paper ties (0), rock wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper beats their frequent scissors choice (+1) but risks big loss to rock (-3)\n   - Rock gives huge reward against paper (+3) but loses to their frequent scissors (-1)\n   - Given their 75% scissors rate, paper seems like the statistically better choice\n\n7. However, they might be due for a switch after showing such a strong scissors pattern. If they switch to rock (to beat expected paper), I'd want scissors.

Risk/reward evaluation:\n   - Paper beats their current rock trend (+1) with no major downside risk\n   - If they're in a \"rock phase\" like they were in a \"scissors phase\", paper is the optimal counter\n   - The worst case with paper is -3 against rock, but their pattern suggests rock continuation\n\n8. Given their clear phase-based playing style and current rock streak, they're likely to continue with rock at least one more time.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to exploit their apparent rock phase, similar to how I successfully exploited their scissors phase earlier.\n\n[move] paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Current total: -4 points\n\n2. Opponent's confirmed pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock FOUR times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8, 9)\n   - This is an extremely strong commitment to rock strategy\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - The opponent has completely shifted to a rock-dominant strategy\n   - They're not just playing phases - they've found a strategy that works\n   - Rock has given them two +3 victories against my paper\n   - They're likely to continue this successful pattern\n\n4. My strategic mistakes analysis:\n   - I've been trying to counter-predict instead of simply countering their obvious pattern\n   - I played paper twice against their rock streak and lost -6 points total\n   - I need to directly counter rock with scissors, not overthink it\n\n5. Opponent psychology:\n   - They've discovered that rock is very profitable (+3 points when it wins)\n   - They might be committed to this strategy since it's working\n   - After four rocks in a row, they might switch, but the pattern is too strong to ignore\n   - They're probably expecting me to continue trying to counter with paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: scissors ties (0), manageable outcome\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors loses (-1), but this seems least likely\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors directly counters their dominant rock strategy\n   - Even if they switch, scissors has limited downside (-1 max)\n   - I need to stop the bleeding from their rock strategy\n\n8. The pattern is so strong (4 rocks in a row) that I must directly counter it rather than try to outthink them.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to directly counter their established rock pattern and stop giving them easy +3 victories.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current total: -3 points\n\n2. Opponent's incredible pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock FIVE times in a row (rounds 6-10)\n   - This is an extraordinarily strong commitment to rock\n\n3. Success with direct countering:\n   - When I played scissors against their rock (rounds 7 and 10), I won both times (+1 each)\n   - When I played paper against their rock (rounds 6 and 9), I lost both times (-3 each)\n   - Direct countering with scissors is clearly the winning strategy\n\n4. Opponent psychology assessment:\n   - Despite losing twice to my scissors, they continued with rock\n   - This suggests either: they're very committed to rock strategy, they're not adapting well, or they're setting up for a major switch\n   - Five rocks in a row is almost unprecedented - they might finally switch\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock again (sixth in a row): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat my successful scissors): rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors  \n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n\n7. Critical decision point:\n   - Their pattern is so extreme (5 rocks) that they might finally break it\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to continue scissors), rock would give me +3\n   - However, if they stick with their pattern, scissors gives me another +1\n   - The question is: do I play it safe with scissors or gamble on rock for the big payoff?\n\n8. Given that they've been so stubbornly committed to rock despite losses, and the pattern is so strong, I think they're more likely to continue than to make a strategic switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors again to continue exploiting their rock obsession, as the pattern is too strong to abandon the winning strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current total: -2 points\n\n2. Opponent's extraordinary pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock SIX times in a row (rounds 6-11)\n   - This is beyond any reasonable strategic variation - it's almost compulsive\n\n3. My recent success:\n   - Last 3 times I played scissors against their rock: won all 3 times (+3 points total)\n   - The direct counter strategy is working perfectly\n   - I've recovered from -5 points to -2 points using this approach\n\n4. Statistical analysis:\n   - 6 rocks in a row has probability of (1/3)^6 = 1/729 if random\n   - This is clearly not random - it's either a deliberate strategy or a behavioral pattern\n   - They're giving me free points by being so predictable\n\n5. Opponent psychology deep dive:\n   - They might be stuck in a pattern and unable to break it\n   - They could be testing my adaptation - seeing if I'll stick with scissors\n   - They might finally switch after 6 consecutive losses to scissors\n   - Or they're so committed to rock that they'll continue despite evidence\n\n6. Critical strategic decision:\n   - Continue with scissors (safe +1 if they play rock again)\n   - Switch to rock (risky +3 if they finally play paper, but -1 if they stick with rock)\n   - The pattern is so extreme that a switch seems overdue\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has been my winning move for 3 straight rounds\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat scissors), I lose -1\n   - If they switch to scissors, we tie at 0\n   - If they somehow continue with rock (7th time!), I win +1 again\n\n8. The pattern is so absurd that they're either completely predictable or about to make a major switch. Given that they've lost 3 times in a row to my scissors and still played rock, they seem truly committed to this strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with scissors one more time to exploit this incredible rock pattern, as they seem unable or unwilling to adapt.\n\n[move] scissors"

Opponent's mind-boggling pattern:\n   - Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock\n   - They've now played rock SEVEN times in a row (rounds 6-12)\n   - This defies all reasonable game theory and strategic thinking\n\n3. My incredible success streak:\n   - Last 4 times playing scissors against their rock: won all 4 (+4 points)\n   - I've completely neutralized their early advantage\n   - They're literally giving me free points at this stage\n\n4. Statistical impossibility analysis:\n   - 7 rocks in a row has probability of (1/3)^7 = 1/2187 if random\n   - This is clearly a deliberate choice or psychological fixation\n   - No rational player would continue this pattern after 4 consecutive losses\n\n5. Opponent psychology - this is beyond normal strategy:\n   - They might be completely locked into rock mentally\n   - They could be testing if I'll ever switch away from the winning scissors\n   - They might be playing some meta-game I don't understand\n   - Or they're simply not adapting at all to feedback\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock (almost guaranteed at this point), 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n\n7. The decision dilemma:\n   - Their pattern is so extreme that a switch seems mathematically inevitable\n   - But they've defied logic for 7 rounds straight\n   - If they switch to paper (finally countering scissors), rock gives me +3\n   - If they somehow play rock an 8th time, scissors gives me another +1\n\n8. At this point, their behavior suggests they may never switch from rock. The pattern is so strong and they've ignored all negative feedback. While a switch to paper seems logical, their behavior has been anything but logical.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with scissors because their rock fixation appears unbreakable, and I should keep exploiting this gift of free points.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Current total: +4 points\n\n2. Opponent's incredible new pattern:\n   - They've now played paper THREE times in a row (rounds 13, 14, 15)\n   - This mirrors their previous rock obsession but with paper\n   - I've won +6 points from their last two paper plays with rock\n\n3. Pattern comparison:\n   - Previous: 7 rocks in a row, then switched to paper\n   - Current: 3 papers in a row after the rock phase\n   - They seem to commit deeply to single moves for extended periods\n\n4. Strategic revelation:\n   - They appear to be in a \"paper phase\" now\n   - Just like their rock phase, they might continue this for several more rounds\n   - My rock strategy is perfectly countering their paper obsession\n   - They're giving me the maximum +3 points repeatedly\n\n5. Opponent psychology assessment:\n   - They don't seem to adapt quickly to losing streaks\n   - They maintain patterns even when being exploited\n   - They might be testing my commitment to rock\n   - Or they're genuinely stuck in paper mode\n\n6. Strategic decision matrix:\n   - If they play paper again (4th time): rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: rock ties (0)\n\n7. Risk analysis:\n   - Rock has given me +6 points in the last 2 rounds\n   - The pattern suggests they might continue with paper\n   - Even if they switch, my maximum loss is -1 with rock\n   - The +3 reward for continuing to beat paper is enormous\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern-following behavior and the fact that they just played paper three times in a row while I consistently beat it with rock, they seem likely to continue.

Opponent's extraordinary pattern:\n   - They've now played paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 13, 14, 15, 16)\n   - I've won +9 points from their last three paper plays with rock\n   - This mirrors their previous 7-rock streak but with even higher rewards for me\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Previous phase: 7 rocks in a row\n   - Current phase: 4 papers in a row and counting\n   - They seem to have completely shifted strategies but maintained the same pattern-heavy approach\n\n4. My exploitation success:\n   - Rock vs their paper has been perfectly successful\n   - I've gained +9 points in just 3 rounds\n   - This is the most profitable streak I've had in the entire game\n   - They're literally giving me maximum points repeatedly\n\n5. Opponent psychology deep dive:\n   - They seem incapable of quick adaptation\n   - They commit to strategies for very long periods\n   - Even massive losses don't immediately change their behavior\n   - They might be testing if I'll ever switch away from rock\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play paper again (5th time): rock wins (+3)\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: rock loses (-1)  \n   - If they switch to rock: rock ties (0)\n\n7. Risk/reward is heavily in my favor:\n   - Rock gives maximum reward against their likely paper\n   - Even if they switch, my maximum loss is only -1\n   - The pattern is so strong that deviation seems unlikely\n   - I'm in an incredibly profitable position\n\n8. Their behavior suggests they're in a deep paper phase just like their previous rock phase. Given that they maintained rock for 7 rounds despite losses, and they're now on paper for 4 rounds while I'm consistently beating them, they seem likely to continue this pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with rock to maximize my advantage from their paper obsession.\n\n[move] (Continuing to exploit their paper obsession) rock"

Opponent's pattern break analysis:\n   - After 4 consecutive papers, they finally switched to scissors\n   - This matches their previous behavior: long pattern then strategic switch\n   - They broke their rock pattern at 7 rounds, broke paper pattern at 4 rounds\n   - The switch came right when I was maximally exploiting their pattern\n\n3. Strategic parallel to earlier game:\n   - Previously: 7 rocks \u2192 paper (to counter my scissors)\n   - Now: 4 papers \u2192 scissors (to counter my rock)\n   - They seem to learn from patterns and make calculated switches\n\n4. Opponent sophistication revealed again:\n   - They allowed me to gain +9 points to establish my rock habit\n   - Then switched to scissors at the perfect moment\n   - This shows advanced strategic thinking and patience\n   - They sacrifice short-term losses for strategic positioning\n\n5. What this tells me about their next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors, thinking I'll stick with rock\n   - They could return to paper, expecting me to switch to paper (to beat scissors)\n   - They might play rock, expecting me to switch to scissors\n   - They've shown they can maintain new patterns after switches\n\n6. Strategic options analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: paper wins (+1), scissors ties (0), rock loses (-1)\n   - If they return to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0), scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: scissors wins (+1), rock ties (0), paper loses (-3)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats scissors and ties with paper, only losing badly to rock\n   - Given they just switched to scissors successfully, they might repeat it\n   - Or they might expect me to adapt and switch back to paper\n   - Paper seems like the safest counter to their likely scissors continuation\n\n8.

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 13-16: Opponent played paper 4 times, I won +9 points with rock\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current total: +7 points\n\n2. Opponent's current pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors TWO times in a row (rounds 17, 18)\n   - This follows their established behavior of committing to patterns\n   - Previous phases: 7 rocks, then 4 papers, now starting scissors phase\n   - My paper successfully countered their scissors for +1 point\n\n3. Pattern recognition:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds  \n   - Scissors phase: 2 rounds so far\n   - They seem to be getting shorter phases but still maintaining patterns\n\n4. Strategic success analysis:\n   - I correctly predicted they'd continue scissors after the switch\n   - Paper beat their scissors as planned\n   - They might continue the scissors pattern or make another switch\n   - Their behavior suggests pattern continuation for at least a few more rounds\n\n5. Opponent psychology:\n   - They've established a clear pattern: commit to one move for multiple rounds\n   - Even when I counter them successfully, they often continue the pattern initially\n   - They eventually switch when the pattern becomes too costly\n   - They're likely to play scissors again based on their behavior\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again (3rd time): paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) with manageable risk\n   - The pattern suggests they'll likely continue scissors for at least one more round\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose -3, and other switches favor me\n   - Paper is the direct counter to their apparent scissors phase\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern-following behavior and the fact that they just played scissors twice in a row, they're likely to continue this pattern for at least another round before considering a switch.\n\nFinal decision: I'll continue with paper to exploit their emerging scissors pattern.\n\n[move] (Continuing to counter their scissors pattern) paper"

Opponent's scissors pattern confirmation:\n   - They've now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 17, 18, 19)\n   - This confirms they're in a \"scissors phase\" like their previous phases\n   - Pattern history: 7 rocks \u2192 4 papers \u2192 3+ scissors\n   - My paper has successfully countered for +2 points in last 2 rounds\n\n3. Phase length analysis:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds (very long)\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds (medium)\n   - Scissors phase: 3 rounds so far (and continuing?)\n   - The phases seem to be getting progressively shorter\n\n4. My counter-strategy success:\n   - Paper vs scissors has worked perfectly for 2 consecutive wins\n   - I'm back to +8 points total, recovering well from earlier losses\n   - The direct counter approach is clearly effective against their patterns\n\n5. Opponent decision point assessment:\n   - They might continue scissors, maintaining their pattern behavior\n   - They could switch after 3 losses, but their history shows longer commitments\n   - Their rock phase lasted through multiple losses, so scissors might continue\n   - They seem to need several losses before breaking patterns\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again (4th time): paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1), paper loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3), paper ties (0)\n\n7. Risk evaluation:\n   - Paper has been consistently profitable against their scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests continuation is more likely than switching\n   - Even if they switch, the maximum loss with paper is -3 against rock\n   - The +1 steady gains are adding up nicely\n\n8. Their commitment to patterns has been their defining characteristic. With only 3 scissors plays so far, and given their history of longer patterns, they're likely to continue scissors for at least another round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll stick with paper to continue exploiting their scissors pattern.\n\n[move] (Exploiting their scissors pattern) paper"

Opponent's scissors streak:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row (rounds 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - This matches the length of their previous paper phase\n   - My paper has perfectly countered for +3 points in the last 3 rounds\n   - Their pattern commitment remains incredibly strong\n\n3. Phase comparison:\n   - Rock phase: 7 rounds (longest)\n   - Paper phase: 4 rounds (medium)\n   - Scissors phase: 4 rounds so far (matching paper phase length)\n   - They might be settling into consistent 4-round phases after the initial rock phase\n\n4. Strategic success tracking:\n   - I'm now at +9 points total, my highest score yet\n   - Paper vs scissors strategy has been flawless\n   - I've recovered completely from all earlier losses\n   - The direct counter approach continues to work perfectly\n\n5. Critical decision point:\n   - Their scissors phase now matches their paper phase length (4 rounds)\n   - They might switch after 4 rounds like they did from paper to scissors\n   - Or they might continue since they've shown they can go longer (7 rocks)\n   - This could be the moment they break the pattern\n\n6. Pattern break risk assessment:\n   - If they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper): I lose -3\n   - If they switch to paper: we tie at 0\n   - If they continue scissors: I win +1 again\n   - The risk of a switch is higher now after 4 consecutive losses\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper continues to beat scissors but risks -3 against rock\n   - Rock would win +3 against paper if they switch\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors or beat rock\n   - Given their switching pattern history, they might change now\n\n8. They switched from paper to scissors after 4 rounds of paper. Now they've played 4 rounds of scissors. This could be their switching point, and if they switch to rock (to counter my successful paper), I should anticipate that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to scissors to potentially counter a rock switch, while accepting a tie if they continue scissors.\n\n[move] (Anticipating potential switch after 4 scissors) scissors"

Pattern shift analysis:\n   - Opponent broke their 4-round scissors pattern by switching to rock\n   - This mirrors their previous behavior: 4 papers \u2192 scissors, now 4 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - My prediction was correct - they switched after exactly 4 rounds\n   - I successfully countered their switch with scissors for +1 point\n\n3. Emerging meta-pattern recognition:\n   - Phase 1: 7 rocks (initial long phase)\n   - Phase 2: 4 papers (standardized length)  \n   - Phase 3: 4 scissors (standardized length)\n   - Phase 4: Rock (just started)\n   - They seem to have settled into 4-round phases after the initial long rock phase\n\n4. Strategic insight breakthrough:\n   - They appear to cycle through moves in 4-round phases now\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (cycling pattern)\n   - I correctly anticipated the switch timing and move choice\n   - This suggests a predictable cycle I can exploit\n\n5. Current position assessment:\n   - I'm at +10 points, my highest score of the entire game\n   - My pattern recognition and adaptation has been excellent\n   - I've successfully countered their last several strategic moves\n   - They might continue with rock for 3 more rounds based on their pattern\n\n6. Strategic options for rock phase:\n   - If they continue rock (round 2 of 4): paper wins (+3)\n   - If they break pattern early: depends on their choice\n   - If they maintain 4-round commitment: paper is optimal for next 3 rounds\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives +3 against rock (maximum reward)\n   - Paper only loses -1 to scissors, manageable risk\n   - If they're starting a rock phase, paper is the perfect counter\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll commit to rock for multiple rounds\n\n8. Given their established 4-round phase pattern and the fact that they just started with rock, they're likely to continue rock for at least 2-3 more rounds.

Wait - analyzing the result:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - Rock beats paper, so opponent should have won +3 and I should have lost -3\n   - But the hint says I lost -3 points, which means rock beat paper\n   - This is correct - rock beats paper for +3 to opponent, -3 to me\n\n3. Corrected pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has now played rock TWO times in a row (rounds 21, 22)\n   - They seem to be in a rock phase as I predicted\n   - However, my paper lost to their rock, not won\n   - I need to counter rock with scissors, not paper\n\n4. Strategic error recognition:\n   - I made a fundamental mistake in the payoff matrix\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 to rock player, -3 to paper player)\n   - To beat rock, I need scissors (+1 to scissors, -1 to rock)\n   - Paper loses to rock, not wins against it\n\n5. Corrected counter strategy:\n   - If they continue rock (likely in their phase): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to scissors: paper wins (+1)\n\n6.
