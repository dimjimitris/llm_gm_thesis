    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established patterns, I should consider what a new player might choose. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first option that comes to mind in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven this tendency and the high reward potential, I'll choose paper to counter a likely rock choice.\n\n[move] paper"

They've completely abandoned rock.\n\nFor round 14, given that paper just lost to my rock again, they might:\n- Stick with paper (their clear preference despite recent losses)\n- Switch to scissors (their other go-to move)\n- Finally return to rock after 8 rounds\n\nSince paper has been losing to my rock repeatedly, and scissors lost to my paper in round 12, they might finally try rock again.
