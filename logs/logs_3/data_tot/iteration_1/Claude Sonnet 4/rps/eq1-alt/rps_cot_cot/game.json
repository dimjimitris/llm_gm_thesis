I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they are new/inexperienced.\n\n3. For the first move against an inexperienced player, I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Since this is the opening move and I have no prior information about this specific opponent's patterns, I should play the move that beats the most likely choice (rock).\n\n5. Paper beats rock, so if my prediction is correct, I'll win +1 point.\n\n6.

Let me re-examine the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\n3.

In this version: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n\n5. For round 2, I need to think about my opponent's behavior:\n   - They played rock in round 1\n   - They're a \"fresh player\" but they won, so they might stick with rock again\n   - Or they might switch thinking I'll counter their rock\n\n6. If they play rock again, I need to play something that beats rock\n   - According to these rules, scissors beats rock\n   - So I should play scissors\n\n7.

Looking at it differently - maybe they're alternating between certain moves:\n   - Rounds 2 and 4: both paper\n   - Maybe they favor paper when they think I'll play scissors?\n\n6. Given the uncertainty, I should consider what beats their most frequent move. They've played paper twice, rock once, scissors once. Paper is most common.\n\n7.

Critical observation:\n   - Paper is heavily favored by this opponent (50% of all plays)\n   - They seem to be getting stuck in paper mode\n   - I keep losing because I'm not consistently playing rock (which beats paper)\n\n6. Looking at my wins/ties:\n   - Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 5: I played rock, they played rock \u2192 tie\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 8: I played paper, they played paper \u2192 tie\n\n7. I need to be more aggressive about playing rock since they clearly favor paper:\n   - Rock beats paper according to the rules\n   - They've played paper 5 out of 10 times\n   - Even if they switch, I have good odds\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, since they've shown a strong preference for paper and just played it three times consecutively.\n\n[move] rock"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They just broke their paper streak! After 3 papers in a row (8-10), they switched to scissors (11)\n   - This mirrors what happened before: 2 scissors in a row (6-7), then switched to paper (8)\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 1, 5)\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11)\n\n5. Looking at their switching behavior:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 6-7), they went to paper\n   - After paper-paper-paper (rounds 8-10), they went to scissors\n   - They seem to switch after consecutive runs\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after switching to scissors in round 11, what might they do?\n   - They could continue with scissors\n   - They could switch to rock (their least played move)\n   - They could go back to paper\n\n7. Looking at what beats each possibility:\n   - To beat scissors: paper\n   - To beat rock: scissors  \n   - To beat paper: rock\n\n8. Given that they just switched from a paper streak to scissors, and rock is still underrepresented, they might either continue scissors or go to rock. But based on their pattern of switching after streaks, they might not immediately repeat scissors.\n\n9. I'll play paper to beat scissors, in case they continue with their fresh switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, anticipating they might continue with their new choice after breaking the paper streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They just played scissors in rounds 11 AND 12 (back-to-back again)\n   - This is similar to their earlier pattern: scissors in rounds 6-7, then paper in rounds 8-10\n\n4.

If they follow their previous pattern:\n   - After 2 scissors, they previously went to paper for a long streak\n   - This time they might go to rock (to balance their moves) or back to paper\n\n7.

Excellent prediction! I correctly anticipated their switch from scissors to rock after their consecutive scissors in rounds 11-12.\n\n4.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They played scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12), then switched to rock (round 13)\n   - This confirms their tendency to switch after consecutive moves\n   - Now the frequency is more balanced: 3 rock, 5 paper, 5 scissors\n\n6. What might they do after playing rock in round 13?\n   - They could continue with rock (less likely based on their switching pattern)\n   - They could go to paper or scissors\n   - Looking at their past behavior after rock: round 1\u2192paper (round 2), round 5\u2192scissors (round 6), round 13\u2192?\n\n7. After rock, they've previously gone to both paper and scissors. Since they just balanced out their rock count, they might go back to paper or scissors.\n\n8. Given that paper is still their most frequent move overall, and they haven't played it recently (last was round 10), they might return to paper.\n\n9. To beat paper, I need rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they might return to their most-used move after balancing with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

However, they might also try to balance their moves since rock is underrepresented.\n\n9. To beat scissors: I need paper\n   To beat rock: I need scissors\n   To beat paper: I need rock\n\n10. Given that scissors appears most frequently after their paper plays, I'll predict scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, based on their historical tendency to play scissors after paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They just played paper twice in a row (rounds 16-17)\n   - This is now their second consecutive paper streak\n   - Earlier they had paper streaks: rounds 8-10 (3 papers), rounds 9-10 (overlapping), now rounds 16-17\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14)\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - Paper is now clearly their most frequent move (7 times)\n   - They're in a paper streak again (like rounds 8-10)\n   - Based on past behavior, they tend to switch after consecutive identical moves\n\n6. Looking at what happened after their previous paper streaks:\n   - After paper-paper-paper (rounds 8-10), they switched to scissors (round 11)\n   - Now after paper-paper (rounds 16-17), they might switch\n\n7. Since they tend to switch after streaks, and scissors is their second most frequent move, they might go to scissors or rock next.\n\n8. However, rock is still underrepresented (only 4 times vs 7 paper, 6 scissors).\n\n9. To beat potential moves:\n   - To beat scissors: paper\n   - To beat rock: scissors\n   - To beat paper (if they continue): rock\n\n10. Given their tendency to switch after consecutive moves and rock being underrepresented, I'll predict rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, anticipating they'll switch from their paper streak to their least-used move.\n\n[move] scissors"

They might switch to scissors or rock, but given the historical precedent of switching to scissors after a 3-paper streak, scissors seems most likely.\n\n8. To beat scissors, I need paper according to the rules.\n\n9.

Excellent! My prediction was correct. They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 21-22), just like they did before in rounds 11-12.\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They're now playing scissors consecutively again (rounds 21-22)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: scissors in rounds 11-12\n   - After the scissors pair in rounds 11-12, they switched to rock (round 13)\n\n6. Historical analysis of what happens after scissors pairs:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12) \u2192 rock (round 13)\n   - Now after scissors-scissors (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n7. If they follow the same pattern, they might switch to rock next.\n\n8. However, I should also consider:\n   - They might continue with scissors (making it 3 in a row)\n   - They might switch to paper (their most frequent move)\n   - Rock is still their least frequent move (only 4 times)\n\n9. Given their historical pattern of switching to rock after scissors pairs, and rock being underrepresented, rock seems likely.\n\n10. To beat rock, I need scissors according to the rules.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, following their historical pattern of switching to rock after playing scissors twice consecutively.\n\n[move] scissors"

Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15, 23)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Looking at what happens after they play rock:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 round 2 (paper)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 13 (rock) \u2192 round 14 (scissors)\n   - Round 15 (rock) \u2192 round 16 (paper)\n   - Round 23 (rock) \u2192 ?\n\n6. After rock, they've gone to:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 2, 16)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 6, 14)\n   - Tie between paper and scissors after rock\n\n7. However, looking at their overall strategy:\n   - Paper is still their most dominant move (10 out of 23 rounds = 43%)\n   - They might return to their paper preference\n   - They've been cycling through patterns but paper remains their baseline\n\n8. Also considering recent trends:\n   - They just completed a scissors-scissors-rock cycle\n   - They might start a new pattern or return to paper dominance\n\n9. To beat paper: I need rock\n   To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n10. Given paper's overall dominance and the fact that it appeared twice after rock historically, I'll predict paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll return to their most frequent move after completing the scissors-scissors-rock pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they are new/inexperienced.\n\n3. For the first move against an inexperienced player, I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Since this is the opening move and I have no prior information about this specific opponent's patterns, I should play the move that beats the most likely choice (rock).\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - Paper is now clearly their most frequent move (7 times)\n   - They're in a paper streak again (like rounds 8-10)\n   - Based on past behavior, they tend to switch after consecutive identical moves\n\n6.

Since they tend to switch after streaks, and scissors is their second most frequent move, they might go to scissors or rock next.\n\n8. However, rock is still underrepresented (only 4 times vs 7 paper, 6 scissors).\n\n9. To beat potential moves:\n   - To beat scissors: paper\n   - To beat rock: scissors\n   - To beat paper (if they continue): rock\n\n10.

Excellent! My prediction was correct. They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 21-22), just like they did before in rounds 11-12.\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They're now playing scissors consecutively again (rounds 21-22)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: scissors in rounds 11-12\n   - After the scissors pair in rounds 11-12, they switched to rock (round 13)\n\n6. Historical analysis of what happens after scissors pairs:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12) \u2192 rock (round 13)\n   - Now after scissors-scissors (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n7. If they follow the same pattern, they might switch to rock next.\n\n8. However, I should also consider:\n   - They might continue with scissors (making it 3 in a row)\n   - They might switch to paper (their most frequent move)\n   - Rock is still their least frequent move (only 4 times)\n\n9. Given their historical pattern of switching to rock after scissors pairs, and rock being underrepresented, rock seems likely.\n\n10. To beat rock, I need scissors according to the rules.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, following their historical pattern of switching to rock after playing scissors twice consecutively.\n\n[move] scissors",

Looking at what happens after they play rock:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 round 2 (paper)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 13 (rock) \u2192 round 14 (scissors)\n   - Round 15 (rock) \u2192 round 16 (paper)\n   - Round 23 (rock) \u2192 ?\n\n6.

However, looking at their overall strategy:\n   - Paper is still their most dominant move (10 out of 23 rounds = 43%)\n   - They might return to their paper preference\n   - They've been cycling through patterns but paper remains their baseline\n\n8. Also considering recent trends:\n   - They just completed a scissors-scissors-rock cycle\n   - They might start a new pattern or return to paper dominance\n\n9. To beat paper: I need rock\n   To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n10. Given paper's overall dominance and the fact that it appeared twice after rock historically, I'll predict paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll return to their most frequent move after completing the scissors-scissors-rock pattern.\n\n[move] rock",

Based on their historical behavior:\n   - When they cluster moves, they often play them 2-3 times\n   - They've now played rock twice, so they might play it once more to complete a cluster of 3\n   - Alternatively, they might switch after 2 (like they sometimes did with pairs)\n\n6. If they continue with rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock).\n\n7. If they switch, the options would be paper or scissors. Given their recent sequence, scissors might be next in some cycling pattern.\n\n8. I'll stick with the clustering hypothesis since it just worked - they seem to be in a \"rock phase\" right now.\n\n9. The risk-reward favors continuing to predict rock since the pattern has been consistent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, expecting my opponent to continue their rock cluster for at least one more round.\n\n[move] scissors",

Now for the second round analysis:\n   - The opponent chose rock in round 1\n   - They might stick with rock again (many players repeat winning moves)\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter their previous rock with paper again\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper\n\n5. Given that they won with rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock again. But there's also a chance they'll try to counter-predict my adjustment.\n\n6. I should play scissors - if they repeat rock, I win. If they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock to beat their previous rock), I lose. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\n7. Playing scissors gives me the best chance against a repeat rock play.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock if they repeat their winning move.\n\n[move] scissors",

Since they just won with rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll play rock again, especially as a fresh player who found success.\n\n5. To beat rock, I need to play scissors (since scissors beats rock according to the rules).\n\n6.

Current frequency count:\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 1, 5)\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 2, 4, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 3, 6, 7)\n\n6. They just played paper in round 8. Looking at what they did after previous paper plays:\n   - After round 2 (paper): they played scissors in round 3\n   - After round 4 (paper): they played rock in round 5\n   - After round 8 (paper): ?\n\n7. Based on their post-paper behavior:\n   - Paper \u2192 scissors (round 2 to 3)\n   - Paper \u2192 rock (round 4 to 5)\n   - Maybe paper \u2192 scissors again? Or rock?\n\n8. If they play scissors, I need paper to beat it\n   If they play rock, I need scissors to beat it\n\n9. Given their tendency to switch after playing the same move or after certain moves, and considering they switched from scissors-scissors to paper, they might go to rock or scissors next.\n\n10. I'll choose scissors to beat rock, since rock appeared after paper before (round 4\u21925 pattern).\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, following the pattern from rounds 4-5.\n\n[move] scissors",

Key pattern observation:\n   - After three consecutive papers (8-9-10), they switched to scissors (11)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: after two scissors (6-7), they went to paper (8)\n   - They seem to switch after consecutive runs\n\n4. Updated frequency:\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 1, 5)\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11)\n\n5. Looking at what they do after playing scissors:\n   - Round 3 (scissors) \u2192 Round 4 (paper)\n   - Round 6 (scissors) \u2192 Round 7 (scissors) \n   - Round 7 (scissors) \u2192 Round 8 (paper)\n   - Round 11 (scissors) \u2192 Round 12 (??)\n\n6. After scissors, they've gone to paper 2 out of 3 times, and scissors 1 time.\n\n7. Also notable: Rock is still their least played move (only 2 times in 11 rounds).\n\n8. Given their tendency to go to paper after scissors, and paper being their most frequent move overall, I should play rock to beat paper.\n\n9. Rock beats paper according to the rules, and this gives me the best chance based on their patterns.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat the likely paper, based on their historical pattern of following scissors with paper.\n\n[move] rock",

Pattern confirmation:\n   - My prediction was correct! After scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12), they switched to rock (round 13)\n   - This mirrors their earlier behavior: scissors-scissors (rounds 6-7) \u2192 paper streak (rounds 8-10)\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 1, 5, 13)\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12)\n\n5. Looking at their switching patterns:\n   - After scissors-scissors (6-7), they went to paper and played it 3 times (8-10)\n   - After scissors-scissors (11-12), they switched to rock (13)\n   - What might they do after rock?\n\n6. Examining what they do after playing rock:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 Round 2 (paper)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 Round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 13 (rock) \u2192 Round 14 (?)\n\n7. After rock, they've gone to both paper and scissors before. No clear pattern there.\n\n8. However, looking at overall balance:\n   - Paper: 5 times (most frequent)\n   - Scissors: 5 times (tied for most frequent)\n   - Rock: 3 times (least frequent)\n\n9. They might continue with rock to balance things out, or switch to paper/scissors.\n\n10. Given their tendency to not repeat the same move too often (except in deliberate streaks), and since rock is still underrepresented, they might play rock again or switch.\n\n11. If rock: I need scissors\n    If paper: I need rock\n    If scissors: I need paper\n\n12. Since they just played rock and haven't shown a pattern of rock streaks (unlike paper and scissors), they'll likely switch. Between paper and scissors, paper is slightly more frequent overall.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll switch from rock to their most-used move.\n\n[move] rock",

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They played scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12), then switched to rock (round 13)\n   - This confirms their tendency to switch after consecutive moves\n   - Now the frequency is more balanced: 3 rock, 5 paper, 5 scissors\n\n6. What might they do after playing rock in round 13?\n   - They could continue with rock (less likely based on their switching pattern)\n   - They could go to paper or scissors\n   - Looking at their past behavior after rock: round 1\u2192paper (round 2), round 5\u2192scissors (round 6), round 13\u2192?\n\n7. After rock, they've previously gone to both paper and scissors. Since they just balanced out their rock count, they might go back to paper or scissors.\n\n8. Given that paper is still their most frequent move overall, and they haven't played it recently (last was round 10), they might return to paper.\n\n9.

Current situation:\n   - They just switched to rock in round 13 after two scissors\n   - Following their pattern, they might continue with rock for 1-2 more rounds\n   - Or they might switch again quickly\n\n6. Looking at their rock usage:\n   - Round 1: rock (start)\n   - Round 5: rock (after paper in round 4)\n   - Round 13: rock (after scissors-scissors in 11-12)\n   - When they play rock, what do they do next?\n   - After round 1 rock \u2192 round 2 paper\n   - After round 5 rock \u2192 round 6 scissors\n\n7. If they continue with rock, I need scissors to beat it.\n   If they switch to paper or scissors, I need rock or paper respectively.\n\n8. Given that I just successfully predicted their switch to rock, and they tend to play moves 2-3 times in streaks, they might play rock again.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, expecting them to continue their new rock phase for at least one more round.\n\n[move] scissors",

Now they just played rock in round 13. Based on their pattern:\n   - They might continue with rock\n   - Or they might switch to paper or scissors\n   - They don't seem to do long streaks of rock (their previous rock plays were isolated)\n\n7.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They played rock (13) then immediately went back to scissors (14)\n   - They're not sticking with rock after playing it\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 1, 5, 13)\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14)\n\n5. Scissors is now their most frequent move (6 times), and they just played it in round 14.\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after playing scissors:\n   - After round 3 (scissors) \u2192 round 4 (paper)\n   - After rounds 6-7 (scissors-scissors) \u2192 round 8 (paper)\n   - After rounds 11-12 (scissors-scissors) \u2192 round 13 (rock)\n   - After round 14 (scissors) \u2192 ?\n\n7. They seem to switch away from scissors when they play it, especially after consecutive scissors. Since they just played a single scissors in round 14, they might:\n   - Switch to paper or rock\n   - Continue with scissors (less likely based on pattern)\n\n8. Given that paper was their go-to after scissors in earlier rounds, and they haven't played paper since round 10, they might return to paper.\n\n9. To beat paper, I need rock.\n\n10. However, I should also consider that I've been successful when I played paper against their scissors. If they continue scissors, paper would win.\n\n11. Since they tend to switch after scissors, I'll predict they go to paper next.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll switch from scissors to paper as they've done before.\n\n[move] rock",

To beat scissors, I need paper according to the rules.\n\n8. This makes strategic sense because:\n   - They've shown this exact pattern before\n   - Paper is my most successful move against their tendencies\n   - I've won 3 times playing paper against their scissors\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, following the historical pattern where they switch to scissors after three consecutive papers.\n\n[move] paper",

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They've now played paper THREE times in a row (rounds 16-18)\n   - This is getting very similar to their earlier paper streak (rounds 8-10 also had 3 papers)\n   - They seem to really favor paper streaks\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 8 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14)\n\n5. Critical observations:\n   - Paper is now HEAVILY favored (8 out of 18 rounds = 44%)\n   - They're in another 3-paper streak\n   - After their last 3-paper streak (rounds 8-10), they switched to scissors (round 11)\n\n6. Pattern recognition:\n   - They seem to love paper - it's their go-to move\n   - When they do paper streaks, they eventually switch but often return to paper\n   - Rock is still significantly underrepresented (only 4 times)\n\n7. My biggest mistake has been not consistently playing rock to beat their paper obsession:\n   - I've lost to paper many times when I could have won with rock\n   - Rock beats paper according to the rules\n\n8. Given that they just played 3 papers in a row (like before), they might switch, but paper is clearly their favorite.\n\n9. I need to be more aggressive about playing rock since they clearly prefer paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, since they have shown a clear preference for paper (8 out of 18 rounds) and just completed another 3-paper streak.\n\n[move] rock",

They might switch to scissors or rock, but given the historical precedent of switching to scissors after a 3-paper streak, scissors seems most likely.\n\n8.

Given their extreme paper preference (9 out of 19 plays), the odds strongly favor them playing paper again.\n\n9.

Looking at their behavior after losing:\n   - When I beat them before (rounds 3, 7, 12, 13), their next moves were: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - So they don't always repeat the losing move\n\n8. However, this current paper streak is so extreme (5 in a row) that it suggests a fundamental bias rather than just random play.\n\n9. Given their overwhelming paper tendency (50% of all plays), and the fact that they just played paper 5 times in a row, there's a strong chance they'll play paper again.\n\n10.

Looking at their behavior after switching to scissors:\n   - After round 11 (scissors), they played scissors again in round 12\n   - This suggests they might play scissors again in round 22\n\n7.

Excellent prediction! They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 21-22), just like their earlier pattern:\n   - After 3-paper streak (8-10) \u2192 scissors-scissors (11-12)\n   - After 5-paper streak (16-20) \u2192 scissors-scissors (21-22)\n\n4.

Pattern recognition:\n   - They consistently play scissors twice after breaking long paper streaks\n   - Historical precedent: scissors-scissors (11-12), then switched to rock (13)\n   - Current: scissors-scissors (21-22), so they might switch to rock next\n\n6. Looking at what they did after the previous scissors-scissors pattern:\n   - After scissors-scissors (11-12), they went to rock (13)\n   - This would make sense as rock is still their least frequent move (4 times vs 10 paper, 8 scissors)\n\n7. If they play rock next (following the historical pattern), I need scissors to beat it.\n\n8. My successful wins have come from recognizing their patterns:\n   - Playing paper when they play scissors (rounds 3, 7, 12, 22)\n   - Playing rock when they were in paper streaks (round 20)\n   - Playing scissors when they played rock (round 13)\n\n9. Given the strong historical precedent of rock following scissors-scissors, I'll predict rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, following their established pattern of switching to rock after playing scissors twice in a row.\n\n[move] scissors",

What happens after rock in their pattern?\n   - After rock in round 13 \u2192 scissors (round 14)\n   - After rock in round 23 \u2192 ?\n   - If the pattern continues, they might play scissors next\n\n7.

After rock, they've gone to:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 2, 16)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 6, 14)\n   - So they're evenly split between paper and scissors after rock\n\n8. However, looking at recent patterns and frequencies:\n   - Paper is still their most frequent move (10 times)\n   - They haven't played paper since round 20 (3 rounds ago)\n   - They might return to their preferred paper\n\n9. To beat paper, I need rock according to the rules.\n\n10. Given that paper is their most frequent move overall and they haven't played it recently, paper seems like a reasonable prediction.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll return to their most frequently used move after the rock.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyzing all rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 tie (0)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie (0)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie (0)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie (0)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 tie (0)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - My total score: -4 points\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: paper\n   - Round 3: scissors\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: rock\n   - Round 6: scissors\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: scissors\n   - Round 13: rock\n   - Round 14: scissors\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: paper\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: scissors\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: rock\n\n3. Perfect prediction again! The pattern is becoming very clear:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12) \u2192 rock (round 13)\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 21-22) \u2192 rock (round 23)\n   - They're following a very consistent pattern\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15, 23)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Pattern analysis for what happens after rock:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 Round 2 (paper)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 Round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 13 (rock) \u2192 Round 14 (scissors)\n   - Round 15 (rock) \u2192 Round 16 (paper)\n   - Round 23 (rock) \u2192 ?\n\n6. After rock, they've gone to:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 2, 16)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 6, 14)\n   - It's evenly split between paper and scissors after rock\n\n7. However, looking at more recent patterns:\n   - In rounds 13 and 15 (more recent rocks), they went to scissors and paper respectively\n   - The most recent rock (round 15) was followed by paper\n\n8. Considering overall frequency:\n   - Paper is still their most frequent move (10 times)\n   - They might return to their paper bias\n   - Or they might alternate to scissors\n\n9. To beat paper: I need rock\n   To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n10. Given that paper is their most frequent overall move and they've shown a strong paper bias throughout the game, I'll predict paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll return to their most frequently used move after playing rock.\n\n[move] rock",
