    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they are new/inexperienced.\n\n3. For the first move against an inexperienced player, I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Since this is the opening move and I have no prior information about this specific opponent's patterns, I should play the move that beats the most likely choice (rock).\n\n5. Paper beats rock, so if my prediction is correct, I'll win +1 point.\n\n6.

For round 2, I need to think about my opponent's behavior:\n   - They played rock in round 1\n   - They're a \"fresh player\" but they won, so they might stick with rock again\n   - Or they might switch thinking I'll counter their rock\n\n6. If they play rock again, I need to play something that beats rock\n   - According to these rules, scissors beats rock\n   - So I should play scissors\n\n7.

Looking at it differently - maybe they're alternating between certain moves:\n   - Rounds 2 and 4: both paper\n   - Maybe they favor paper when they think I'll play scissors?\n\n6. Given the uncertainty, I should consider what beats their most frequent move. They've played paper twice, rock once, scissors once. Paper is most common.\n\n7.

Key observations:\n   - Paper is now their most frequent move (4 times)\n   - They've played paper back-to-back in rounds 8-9\n   - This is similar to when they played scissors back-to-back in rounds 6-7\n   - After scissors-scissors (6-7), they switched to paper (8)\n\n6. Following this pattern logic:\n   - After paper-paper (8-9), they might switch to rock or scissors\n   - Rock is their least played move, so they might balance it out\n   - Or they might go to scissors since that's what happened in the earlier pattern\n\n7. To beat their possible moves:\n   - If rock: I need scissors\n   - If scissors: I need paper\n   - If paper (continuing): I need rock\n\n8. Given that rock is underrepresented and they tend to switch after back-to-back moves, I'll predict rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat the predicted rock, following the pattern that they switch after consecutive identical moves.\n\n[move] scissors"

Critical observation:\n   - Paper is heavily favored by this opponent (50% of all plays)\n   - They seem to be getting stuck in paper mode\n   - I keep losing because I'm not consistently playing rock (which beats paper)\n\n6. Looking at my wins/ties:\n   - Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 5: I played rock, they played rock \u2192 tie\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 8: I played paper, they played paper \u2192 tie\n\n7. I need to be more aggressive about playing rock since they clearly favor paper:\n   - Rock beats paper according to the rules\n   - They've played paper 5 out of 10 times\n   - Even if they switch, I have good odds\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, since they've shown a strong preference for paper and just played it three times consecutively.\n\n[move] rock"

Pattern analysis:\n   - They just broke their paper streak! After 3 papers in a row (8-10), they switched to scissors (11)\n   - This mirrors what happened before: 2 scissors in a row (6-7), then switched to paper (8)\n\n4.

Looking at their switching behavior:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 6-7), they went to paper\n   - After paper-paper-paper (rounds 8-10), they went to scissors\n   - They seem to switch after consecutive runs\n\n6. If this pattern continues, after switching to scissors in round 11, what might they do?\n   - They could continue with scissors\n   - They could switch to rock (their least played move)\n   - They could go back to paper\n\n7. Looking at what beats each possibility:\n   - To beat scissors: paper\n   - To beat rock: scissors  \n   - To beat paper: rock\n\n8. Given that they just switched from a paper streak to scissors, and rock is still underrepresented, they might either continue scissors or go to rock. But based on their pattern of switching after streaks, they might not immediately repeat scissors.\n\n9. I'll play paper to beat scissors, in case they continue with their fresh switch to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, anticipating they might continue with their new choice after breaking the paper streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Excellent prediction! I correctly anticipated their switch from scissors to rock after their consecutive scissors in rounds 11-12.\n\n4.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They played scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12), then switched to rock (round 13)\n   - This confirms their tendency to switch after consecutive moves\n   - Now the frequency is more balanced: 3 rock, 5 paper, 5 scissors\n\n6. What might they do after playing rock in round 13?\n   - They could continue with rock (less likely based on their switching pattern)\n   - They could go to paper or scissors\n   - Looking at their past behavior after rock: round 1\u2192paper (round 2), round 5\u2192scissors (round 6), round 13\u2192?\n\n7. After rock, they've previously gone to both paper and scissors. Since they just balanced out their rock count, they might go back to paper or scissors.\n\n8.

Key observations:\n   - Paper and scissors are now tied at 6 times each\n   - Rock is least frequent at 4 times\n   - They just played paper, breaking their recent rock-scissors pattern\n\n6.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - They just played paper twice in a row (rounds 16-17)\n   - This is now their second consecutive paper streak\n   - Earlier they had paper streaks: rounds 8-10 (3 papers), rounds 9-10 (overlapping), now rounds 16-17\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14)\n\n5. Key observations:\n   - Paper is now clearly their most frequent move (7 times)\n   - They're in a paper streak again (like rounds 8-10)\n   - Based on past behavior, they tend to switch after consecutive identical moves\n\n6. Looking at what happened after their previous paper streaks:\n   - After paper-paper-paper (rounds 8-10), they switched to scissors (round 11)\n   - Now after paper-paper (rounds 16-17), they might switch\n\n7. Since they tend to switch after streaks, and scissors is their second most frequent move, they might go to scissors or rock next.\n\n8. However, rock is still underrepresented (only 4 times vs 7 paper, 6 scissors).\n\n9. To beat potential moves:\n   - To beat scissors: paper\n   - To beat rock: scissors\n   - To beat paper (if they continue): rock\n\n10.

Critical observation:\n   - Paper is now heavily dominant (8 out of 18 rounds = 44%)\n   - They're repeating the exact same pattern: 3 papers in a row\n   - History suggests they switch after 3 consecutive papers\n\n6.

They might switch to scissors or rock, but given the historical precedent of switching to scissors after a 3-paper streak, scissors seems most likely.\n\n8.

Shocking development:\n   - They just played paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 16-19)\n   - This is even longer than their previous 3-paper streak (rounds 8-10)\n   - They're completely stuck in paper mode now\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 9 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14)\n\n5. Critical observation:\n   - Paper is now massively dominant (9 out of 19 rounds = 47%)\n   - They've played paper 4 times in a row, which is unprecedented\n   - This suggests they're either stuck in a pattern or heavily biased toward paper\n\n6. Looking at their switching behavior:\n   - They switched after 3 papers before (rounds 8-10 \u2192 scissors in round 11)\n   - But now they've gone beyond 3 papers and are still playing paper\n   - This might indicate a new phase where they're even more committed to paper\n\n7.

Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21)\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They consistently switch to scissors after long paper streaks\n   - They might continue with scissors for a few rounds (like they did after round 11: scissors in 11-12)\n   - Or they might switch again\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after switching to scissors:\n   - After round 11 (scissors), they played scissors again in round 12\n   - This suggests they might play scissors again in round 22\n\n7. To beat scissors, I need paper according to the rules.\n\n8. Given their pattern of playing scissors after breaking paper streaks, and their tendency to sometimes repeat scissors, paper seems like a strong choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors, following their historical pattern of switching to scissors after long paper streaks.\n\n[move] paper"

Excellent! My prediction was correct. They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 21-22), just like they did before in rounds 11-12.\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They're now playing scissors consecutively again (rounds 21-22)\n   - This mirrors their earlier pattern: scissors in rounds 11-12\n   - After the scissors pair in rounds 11-12, they switched to rock (round 13)\n\n6. Historical analysis of what happens after scissors pairs:\n   - After scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12) \u2192 rock (round 13)\n   - Now after scissors-scissors (rounds 21-22) \u2192 ?\n\n7. If they follow the same pattern, they might switch to rock next.\n\n8. However, I should also consider:\n   - They might continue with scissors (making it 3 in a row)\n   - They might switch to paper (their most frequent move)\n   - Rock is still their least frequent move (only 4 times)\n\n9. Given their historical pattern of switching to rock after scissors pairs, and rock being underrepresented, rock seems likely.\n\n10. To beat rock, I need scissors according to the rules.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock, following their historical pattern of switching to rock after playing scissors twice consecutively.\n\n[move] scissors"

Perfect prediction again! They followed the exact same pattern:\n   - scissors-scissors (rounds 11-12) \u2192 rock (round 13)\n   - scissors-scissors (rounds 21-22) \u2192 rock (round 23)\n   - I'm successfully identifying their patterns!\n\n4. Updated frequency count:\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 5, 13, 15, 23)\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 21, 22)\n\n5. Looking at what happens after they play rock:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 round 2 (paper)\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 13 (rock) \u2192 round 14 (scissors)\n   - Round 15 (rock) \u2192 round 16 (paper)\n   - Round 23 (rock) \u2192 ?\n\n6. After rock, they've gone to:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 2, 16)\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 6, 14)\n   - Tie between paper and scissors after rock\n\n7. However, looking at their overall strategy:\n   - Paper is still their most dominant move (10 out of 23 rounds = 43%)\n   - They might return to their paper preference\n   - They've been cycling through patterns but paper remains their baseline\n\n8. Also considering recent trends:\n   - They just completed a scissors-scissors-rock cycle\n   - They might start a new pattern or return to paper dominance\n\n9. To beat paper: I need rock\n   To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n10. Given paper's overall dominance and the fact that it appeared twice after rock historically, I'll predict paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat paper, anticipating they'll return to their most frequent move after completing the scissors-scissors-rock pattern.\n\n[move] rock"
