    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their playing patterns or tendencies.\n4. Fresh/new players often have predictable tendencies - they commonly choose Rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\" to beginners.\n5. If they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to beat it and win +1 points.\n6. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper has an equal 1/3 chance against any random choice, so there's no mathematical disadvantage.\n7.

Let me re-read the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So Paper does beat Scissors in this game!\n4. This means I correctly won the first round by choosing Paper against their Scissors.\n5. Now I have one data point: my opponent chose Scissors in round 1.\n6. For round 2, I need to consider what they might do next. They lost with Scissors, so they might:\n   - Switch to Rock (which would beat my Scissors if I chose it)\n   - Switch to Paper (which would beat Rock if I chose it)\n   - Stick with Scissors again\n7. Many players after losing will try the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move. Since I played Paper, they might choose Rock to beat Paper.\n8. If they choose Rock, I should choose Paper again to beat Rock.\n9. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch, so this becomes a mind game.\n10.

Clear pattern confirmation: They have returned to Scissors again in round 10, strengthening their preference (now 6 out of 10 rounds = 60%).\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after playing Rock: \n   - Round 2 (Rock) \u2192 Round 3 (Scissors)\n   - Round 7 (Rock) \u2192 Round 8 (Scissors) \n   - Round 9 (Rock) \u2192 Round 10 (Scissors)\n\n7. There's a strong pattern: Every time they play Rock, they follow it with Scissors in the next round.\n\n8. This suggests they use Rock as a brief deviation but always return to their comfort zone of Scissors.\n\n9. Given they just played Scissors in round 10, and their overall strong preference for Scissors (60% of games), they will most likely play Scissors again in round 11.\n\n10. If they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to beat it.\n\n11. This strategy has been successful for me multiple times when I correctly predicted their Scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose Rock to beat their highly probable Scissors choice, given their 60% preference and consistent pattern of favoring Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

This suggests they might be:\n   - Copying my moves when I play Rock\n   - Or predicting that I'll play Rock and matching it to force ties\n\n8. Their Rock usage has increased from 3 to 4 times, all in response to my Rock plays.\n\n9. For round 12, if I play Rock again, they'll likely play Rock again (based on perfect correlation).\n\n10. If I play something other than Rock, they'll likely revert to their preferred Scissors.\n\n11. I should avoid Rock to break this tie pattern. If I play Paper or Scissors, they'll probably play Scissors (their default), giving me different outcomes.\n\n12.

The pattern is now crystal clear:\n   - When I play Rock, they play Rock (resulting in ties)\n   - When I play anything else, they play Scissors (their default preference)\n\n7. Scissors preference has increased to 7 out of 12 rounds (58.3%), and they've played Scissors in every round where I didn't play Rock recently.\n\n8. This gives me a clear winning strategy: Avoid Rock (which leads to ties) and play Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\n9. For round 13, if I play Paper again, they should play Scissors again based on this established pattern.\n\n10. If they play Scissors and I play Paper, I win another point.\n\n11.

Previous Rock pattern was mostly reactive to my Rock plays, but now they're playing Rock independently and consecutively.\n\n7. This suggests they may have shifted strategy to favor Rock more, possibly because:\n   - Rock beat my Paper in round 13\n   - They're trying to counter my historical patterns\n   - They're becoming more aggressive with Rock\n\n8.

For round 15, they might:\n   - Continue with Rock (if they think it's working)\n   - Return to Scissors (their historical favorite)\n   - Try Paper (their least used move)\n\n10.

They're cycling through all three moves more frequently now.\n\n7. Their Paper usage has increased from being very rare (only 2 times in first 16 rounds) to appearing twice in the last 4 rounds.\n\n8.

If they think I'll play Rock to beat their potential Scissors, they might play Paper.\n\n14. This is getting into higher-level mind games. I should consider what they think I think they'll do.\n\n15. Since they just successfully used Rock and might expect me to change, I'll assume they return to their statistical favorite: Scissors. I'll choose Paper to beat Scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose Paper to beat their likely return to Scissors, their statistically most frequent move despite the recent Rock success.\n\n[move] (They likely return to their most frequent choice after the successful rock diversion) paper"

Updated frequency: Scissors (10 times), Rock (9 times), Paper (3 times).\n\n5. They chose Rock again! Now they've played Rock twice consecutively (rounds 21-22).\n\n6. Rock usage has increased to 9/22 (41%), getting very close to Scissors at 10/22 (45%).\n\n7. Clear pattern emerging: They've adapted their strategy. When I started successfully beating their Scissors with Paper, they switched to Rock to counter my Paper.\n\n8. Recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They've moved from a Scissors streak to a Rock streak.\n\n9. This opponent is clearly learning and adapting. They're no longer predictably favoring Scissors.\n\n10. They seem to have recognized my Paper strategy and are countering it with Rock.\n\n11. For round 23, they might:\n    - Continue with Rock (since it's working against my Paper)\n    - Return to Scissors (still slightly their most frequent move)\n    - Try Paper (still their least used)\n\n12. Given that Rock has beaten my Paper twice in a row, they might expect me to switch away from Paper.\n\n13. If I switch to Scissors (to beat their potential Rock), they might anticipate this and play Rock again.\n\n14. If I switch to Rock (to tie or because I think they'll switch), they might play Paper.\n\n15. The mind game is intensifying. I think they'll continue with Rock since it's been successful. I should choose Scissors to beat Rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose Scissors to beat their likely continued Rock usage, since Rock has been successful against my recent Paper plays.\n\n[move] (Rock has been working for them so they might continue with it) scissors"

Recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They've shifted from a Scissors streak to a Rock streak.\n\n7. My adaptation worked perfectly - I correctly predicted their Rock continuation and chose Scissors to beat it.\n\n8. The opponent has clearly changed their strategy from Scissors-heavy to Rock-heavy, likely in response to my Paper success against their Scissors.\n\n9. Current distribution: Scissors (43%), Rock (43%), Paper (13%). They've completely balanced Scissors and Rock.\n\n10. For round 24, they might:\n    - Continue the Rock streak (they've shown willingness to play the same move 3+ times in a row)\n    - Switch back to Scissors (now tied with Rock in frequency)\n    - Try Paper (still significantly underused)\n\n11. Given that I just beat their Rock with Scissors, they might expect me to play Scissors again if they continue with Rock.\n\n12. They might switch to Paper to beat my potential Scissors.\n\n13. Or they might return to Scissors, thinking I won't expect it after the Rock streak.\n\n14. This is a complex decision point. They've been adaptable and strategic.\n\n15. I think they'll either continue Rock (since they've committed to a streak) or switch to Paper to counter my successful Scissors. I'll choose Rock to beat their potential Paper or tie with their potential Rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose Rock to beat their potential Paper counter-move or tie if they continue their Rock streak.\n\n[move] (They might switch to paper to counter my successful scissors) rock"
