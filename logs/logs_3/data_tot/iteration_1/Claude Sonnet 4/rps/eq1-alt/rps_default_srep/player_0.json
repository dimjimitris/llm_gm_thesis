You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Rock just won them a point, so they might be inclined to stick with it again, especially given their historical success and comfort with rock.\n\nLooking at their overall pattern, rock remains their most frequent move, and they tend to have some success with it. After winning with rock, they might try it again.\n\nHowever, they've also shown a tendency to switch moves more frequently in recent rounds rather than clustering as much as they did earlier. They could go to paper or scissors next.\n\nGiven that rock just won for them and considering their overall preference for rock throughout the game, I think there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n[move] (Expecting rock repeat after their recent win with it) paper"
