My opponent just played: rock, paper, scissors in their last three moves - one of each! After all their clustering and patterns, they seem to be cycling through all three moves now. \n\nTheir recent sequence shows: scissors, rock, paper, scissors. If they continue this more balanced approach, they might play rock next to complete another cycle, or they could go to paper.\n\nWe've had two ties in a row now (paper, then scissors), which suggests either we're thinking similarly or they're following some pattern I'm unconsciously mirroring.\n\nGiven that they just cycled through rock-paper-scissors, and considering their historical preference for rock, I think rock is most likely next.\n\n[move] (Expecting rock based on their cycling pattern and historical preference) paper",

Their last four moves were: rock, paper, scissors, rock. This looks like they're doing a more systematic cycling approach now.\n\nIf they continue this rock-paper-scissors cycling pattern, paper would be next. Or they might stick with rock since it just won them a point. Looking at their overall game, rock has been their most successful and frequent move.\n\nGiven that rock just won for them and considering their historical attachment to rock, they might play it again.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
