    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Think about optimal strategy for first move:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no mathematically superior first move\n   - However, psychological studies suggest that inexperienced players often choose rock as their first move (it's intuitive and feels \"strong\")\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Given that my opponent is \"fresh\" and rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Playing paper gives me the best chance to win if they choose rock\n   - If they choose scissors or paper instead, I'll either lose or tie, but the potential upside outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper - reasoning that a fresh player might instinctively choose rock as their first move"

Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch from Rock, they'll likely go to Paper or Scissors\n   - Given they just lost with Rock, they might avoid it temporarily\n   - Between Paper and Scissors, they might choose randomly\n   - I need to pick the move that beats the most likely alternative\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Since Rock just lost, they might avoid it\n   - Between Paper and Scissors, I'll guess Paper (it worked for them in round 7)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - This also covers me if they stick with Rock (rock vs rock = tie, not terrible)\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock - anticipating opponent might switch to paper after rock just lost, or they might stick with rock since it's their preferred move"

Notice recent trends:\n   - Last 3 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper (rounds 7-8-9)\n   - They're alternating between Paper and Rock recently\n   - They seem to have moved away from Scissors lately\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 6, 8)\n   - Paper: 3 times (rounds 3, 7, 9) - increasing frequency\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 4) - hasn't appeared since round 4\n\n5. Look for emerging patterns:\n   - Recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - If this alternating continues, next would be Rock\n   - Paper is becoming more frequent (3 out of last 4 moves were Paper or Rock)\n   - Scissors seems to be abandoned\n\n6. Analyze their strategy shift:\n   - Early game: more varied (Rock, Scissors, Paper mix)\n   - Recent game: mostly Rock and Paper alternation\n   - They might be settling into a Rock-Paper binary choice\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If following the Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper pattern, next should be Rock\n   - They just lost with Paper, so might switch to Rock\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared in 5 rounds, so unlikely\n   - Rock vs Paper seems to be their current focus\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Strong indication they'll play Rock next (following the alternating pattern)\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - This also gives me a win if they surprise me and stick with Paper (but less likely)\n   - Low risk since Scissors hasn't been their choice recently\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors - expecting opponent to continue the recent Paper-Rock alternating pattern by playing rock next"

Notice the latest development:\n   - They played Paper in consecutive rounds (9 and 10)\n   - This breaks the alternating Paper-Rock pattern I thought I saw\n   - Paper just beat my Scissors twice (rounds 7 and 10)\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 6, 8)\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 3, 7, 9, 10) - now tied with Rock\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 4) - still lowest, last seen in round 4\n\n5. Look at recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They seem to be favoring Paper lately (3 out of last 4 moves)\n   - Paper has been successful against my moves recently\n\n6. Analyze their apparent strategy:\n   - They might have noticed I've been playing Scissors frequently\n   - Paper beats Scissors, so they could be exploiting this\n   - They might continue with Paper if they think I'll play Scissors again\n\n7. Consider what they might do next:\n   - Continue with Paper (it's been working)\n   - Switch to Rock (to balance their frequency)\n   - Unlikely to choose Scissors (hasn't appeared in 6 rounds)\n\n8.

Analyze the current situation:\n   - All three moves are now more balanced in frequency\n   - They just played Scissors after two Papers\n   - Hard to predict their next move based on patterns alone\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might continue balancing by playing Rock (least recent)\n   - They might switch to Paper (was working well recently)\n   - Less likely to repeat Scissors immediately after breaking a long absence\n\n8. Think about my strategy:\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n9.

Review my current situation:\n   - Current total score: -5 points (still losing badly)\n   - Round 16: Tie with Scissors vs Scissors (at least not another loss)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated move sequence:\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n   - Round 14: Paper\n   - Round 15: Rock\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Notice what just happened:\n   - They went back to Scissors after playing Rock\n   - No clear alternating pattern anymore\n   - They seem to be mixing all three moves more randomly now\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times (just increased)\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - The frequencies are becoming more balanced\n\n5. Step back and think about the bigger picture:\n   - I've been losing consistently by trying to predict their moves\n   - Every strategy I've tried has failed\n   - Maybe I'm overthinking this entirely\n   - Perhaps I should focus on randomizing my own play\n\n6. Consider a meta-strategy:\n   - Instead of trying to predict them, maybe I should just try to be unpredictable myself\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, if both players play randomly, the expected outcome is a tie\n   - Given that I'm down -5 points, even ties would be better than continued losses\n\n7. Look at my own recent moves:\n   - I've been switching between all three moves trying to counter-predict\n   - Maybe I should just pick based on what I haven't played recently\n   - Or pick the move that would give me the best outcome against their most common choice\n\n8. Simple decision approach:\n   - Their most frequent move overall is still Paper (6 times)\n   - If I assume they're slightly more likely to play Paper, I should play Rock\n   - Rock beats Paper, ties with Rock, loses to Scissors\n   - This gives me the best chance against their most frequent choice\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock - playing against their most frequent overall move (paper) while trying to stop overthinking and just make a solid choice"

Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 6 times (now tied for most frequent)\n   - Paper: 6 times \n   - Rock: 5 times\n\n4. Brutal honest assessment:\n   - I have lost or tied in every single round for a very long time\n   - Every prediction strategy I've tried has failed\n   - I'm clearly being outplayed consistently\n   - They seem to counter whatever I do\n\n5. Consider what might actually be happening:\n   - They might be reading my thought process somehow\n   - They could be using a strategy I'm not recognizing\n   - Or they might just be getting lucky with timing\n   - But the consistency suggests skill, not luck\n\n6. Try a completely different approach:\n   - Stop trying to predict their moves entirely\n   - Stop looking for patterns in their play\n   - Focus on what I haven't done recently myself\n   - Make a choice based purely on my own pattern, not theirs\n\n7.

Moment of clarity:\n   - I need to stop overthinking completely\n   - All my analysis and pattern-seeking has failed consistently\n   - I'm -6 points behind, which means I've been making poor decisions\n   - Time for a radically different approach\n\n5. New strategy - complete simplification:\n   - Forget about predicting their moves\n   - Forget about analyzing patterns\n   - Just focus on making a basic, sound choice\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, each move has equal theoretical value\n\n6.

Analyze what's happening:\n   - They played Paper in both rounds 19 and 20\n   - My Rock beat their Paper both times\n   - The simple approach of \"play Rock to beat their most frequent move\" is succeeding\n\n3.

Key insight from recent success:\n   - When I stopped trying to predict their adaptations and just played the statistical favorite, I started winning\n   - They've now played Paper in back-to-back rounds even after losing to Rock\n   - This suggests they either haven't adapted or Paper is truly their preferred/default move\n\n6.

Analyze the pattern:\n   - They have played Paper in rounds 19, 20, and 21 consecutively\n   - My Rock has beaten their Paper three times in a row\n   - They seem committed to Paper despite losing repeatedly\n\n3.

What the evidence shows:\n   - They've played Paper three times in a row even while losing\n   - Paper remains by far their most frequent choice overall\n   - My simple strategy has been perfectly successful\n   - There's no evidence they're adapting despite repeated losses\n\n7. Psychological consideration:\n   - It's tempting to think \"they MUST switch now\"\n   - But that's prediction-based thinking, which failed me for many rounds\n   - The data-driven approach (play against most frequent move) is working\n   - Trust the method, not the speculation\n\n8.
