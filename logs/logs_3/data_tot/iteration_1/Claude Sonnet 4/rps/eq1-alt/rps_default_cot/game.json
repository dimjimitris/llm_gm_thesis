After playing scissors in round 12, following the alternating pattern, they should play rock next.\n\nTheir overall count:\n- Paper: 1 time (only round 1) \n- Scissors: 7 times\n- Rock: 5 times\n\nThey've stuck to scissors/rock alternation and completely avoided paper for 11 consecutive rounds. \n\nBased on the strong alternating pattern, I predict rock next.\n\n[move] scissors",

Look for recent patterns:\n   - Last 3 moves: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They broke out of the Rock streak with Paper\n   - They successfully countered my Scissors with Paper\n\n6. Consider their potential next move:\n   - They might continue with Paper since it just worked\n   - They might switch back to Rock (their most frequent choice)\n   - They might go to Scissors to complete a cycle\n   - They could be trying to counter-predict my next move\n\n7. Think about my strategy:\n   - If they play Paper again, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - They just had success with Paper after a Rock streak\n   - They might stick with Paper since it worked\n   - Or they might return to Rock since that's been their most common choice\n   - I'll guess Rock since they tend to favor it overall, and play Scissors to counter it\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors - betting they'll return to rock, which has been their most frequently played move throughout the game"

Notice recent behavior:\n   - They went Paper \u2192 Rock (rounds 7-8)\n   - Rock continues to be their go-to move\n   - They seem to return to Rock frequently\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 6, 8) - clearly dominant\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 4)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 3, 7)\n   - Rock is now exactly half of their moves (4 out of 8)\n\n5. Look for patterns in their Rock usage:\n   - Rock appeared in: rounds 1, 5, 6, 8\n   - They had back-to-back Rocks in rounds 5-6\n   - After switching to Paper in round 7, they returned to Rock in round 8\n   - Rock seems to be their \"default\" or comfort choice\n\n6. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just played Rock and it lost to my Scissors\n   - They might switch away from Rock since it just failed\n   - Or they might stick with Rock since it's their most frequent choice\n   - Paper and Scissors are tied at 2 appearances each\n\n7. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they switch from Rock, they'll likely go to Paper or Scissors\n   - Given they just lost with Rock, they might avoid it temporarily\n   - Between Paper and Scissors, they might choose randomly\n   - I need to pick the move that beats the most likely alternative\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Since Rock just lost, they might avoid it\n   - Between Paper and Scissors, I'll guess Paper (it worked for them in round 7)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - This also covers me if they stick with Rock (rock vs rock = tie, not terrible)\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock - anticipating opponent might switch to paper after rock just lost, or they might stick with rock since it's their preferred move"

Analyze their strategy shift:\n   - Early game: more varied (Rock, Scissors, Paper mix)\n   - Recent game: mostly Rock and Paper alternation\n   - They might be settling into a Rock-Paper binary choice\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If following the Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper pattern, next should be Rock\n   - They just lost with Paper, so might switch to Rock\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared in 5 rounds, so unlikely\n   - Rock vs Paper seems to be their current focus\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Strong indication they'll play Rock next (following the alternating pattern)\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - This also gives me a win if they surprise me and stick with Paper (but less likely)\n   - Low risk since Scissors hasn't been their choice recently\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors\n\n[move] Scissors - expecting opponent to continue the recent Paper-Rock alternating pattern by playing rock next"

Analyze their apparent strategy:\n   - They might have noticed I've been playing Scissors frequently\n   - Paper beats Scissors, so they could be exploiting this\n   - They might continue with Paper if they think I'll play Scissors again\n\n7. Consider what they might do next:\n   - Continue with Paper (it's been working)\n   - Switch to Rock (to balance their frequency)\n   - Unlikely to choose Scissors (hasn't appeared in 6 rounds)\n\n8.

Major realization - they're becoming more unpredictable:\n   - Just when I thought they favored Paper, they played Scissors\n   - This is the first Scissors since round 4 (7 rounds ago)\n   - They successfully countered my Rock with Scissors\n\n4.

Look at their recent strategy:\n   - They seem to be cycling through all three moves more evenly now\n   - They might be deliberately trying to balance their choices\n   - Or they could be adapting to counter my predictions\n\n6. Analyze the current situation:\n   - All three moves are now more balanced in frequency\n   - They just played Scissors after two Papers\n   - Hard to predict their next move based on patterns alone\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might continue balancing by playing Rock (least recent)\n   - They might switch to Paper (was working well recently)\n   - Less likely to repeat Scissors immediately after breaking a long absence\n\n8. Think about my strategy:\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n9.

Strong pattern recognition:\n   - They ARE alternating Paper and Scissors consistently\n   - Paper in rounds: 10, 12, 14 (even-numbered recent rounds)\n   - Scissors in rounds: 11, 13 (odd-numbered recent rounds)\n   - This is a clear, predictable pattern now\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - Following the strict alternating pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Round 15 should be Scissors (following the odd/even pattern)\n   - They've been very consistent with this alternation\n\n5. Consider why they're doing this:\n   - Maybe they think I won't notice the pattern\n   - Or they're testing if I can adapt to predictable behavior\n   - The tie in round 14 might not change their pattern\n\n6. Plan my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play Scissors (highly likely), I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - This would give me my first win in several rounds\n   - Even if they break the pattern, Paper has good odds against their other likely choices\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - High confidence they'll play Scissors based on the alternating pattern\n   - Playing Paper gives me the win if I'm right\n   - If wrong and they play Rock, I lose - but Rock hasn't appeared recently\n   - If wrong and they play Paper again, it's another tie\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - The alternating pattern is too clear to ignore\n   - Scissors is due based on their Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper sequence\n   - I need to capitalize on this predictability\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper - expecting opponent to continue their clear alternating pattern by playing scissors next, which paper beats"

Think about optimal strategy for first move:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no mathematically superior first move\n   - However, psychological studies suggest that inexperienced players often choose rock as their first move (it's intuitive and feels \"strong\")\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Given that my opponent is \"fresh\" and rock is a common first choice for new players\n   - Playing paper gives me the best chance to win if they choose rock\n   - If they choose scissors or paper instead, I'll either lose or tie, but the potential upside outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper - reasoning that a fresh player might instinctively choose rock as their first move",

Notice the latest development:\n   - They played Paper in consecutive rounds (9 and 10)\n   - This breaks the alternating Paper-Rock pattern I thought I saw\n   - Paper just beat my Scissors twice (rounds 7 and 10)\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 6, 8)\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 3, 7, 9, 10) - now tied with Rock\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 4) - still lowest, last seen in round 4\n\n5. Look at recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They seem to be favoring Paper lately (3 out of last 4 moves)\n   - Paper has been successful against my moves recently\n\n6. Analyze their apparent strategy:\n   - They might have noticed I've been playing Scissors frequently\n   - Paper beats Scissors, so they could be exploiting this\n   - They might continue with Paper if they think I'll play Scissors again\n\n7. Consider what they might do next:\n   - Continue with Paper (it's been working)\n   - Switch to Rock (to balance their frequency)\n   - Unlikely to choose Scissors (hasn't appeared in 6 rounds)\n\n8. Think about my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play Paper again, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they switch to Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - Given Paper's recent success for them, Rock seems like my best bet\n\n9. Make my decision:\n   - Paper has been their most recent preference and successful strategy\n   - I should counter with Rock to beat their likely Paper choice\n   - This also hedges against them balancing with Rock (tie vs loss)\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock - anticipating opponent will continue with paper since it's been their recent successful strategy against my scissors plays",

Look at their recent strategy:\n   - They seem to be cycling through all three moves more evenly now\n   - They might be deliberately trying to balance their choices\n   - Or they could be adapting to counter my predictions\n\n6. Analyze the current situation:\n   - All three moves are now more balanced in frequency\n   - They just played Scissors after two Papers\n   - Hard to predict their next move based on patterns alone\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might continue balancing by playing Rock (least recent)\n   - They might switch to Paper (was working well recently)\n   - Less likely to repeat Scissors immediately after breaking a long absence\n\n8. Think about my strategy:\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n9.

Decision framework:\n   - Keep it simple like round 19\n   - Paper is still their most frequent move by far (8/19 = 42%)\n   - Rock still gives me the best odds against their most likely choice\n   - Don't overcomplicate what just worked\n\n8. Make the decision:\n   - Continue with the simple strategy that just succeeded\n   - Play Rock again to beat Paper\n   - If they stick with Paper, I win again\n   - If they switch, at least I'm using a proven approach\n\nFinal decision: Play rock\n\n[move] Rock - sticking with the simple strategy that just worked by continuing to play against their most frequent move (paper)",

Analyze what's happening:\n   - They played Paper in both rounds 19 and 20\n   - My Rock beat their Paper both times\n   - The simple approach of \"play Rock to beat their most frequent move\" is succeeding\n\n3. Updated frequency analysis after round 20:\n   - Paper: 9 times (even more dominant now)\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper is now 45% of their total moves (9 out of 20)\n\n4.

Key insight from recent success:\n   - When I stopped trying to predict their adaptations and just played the statistical favorite, I started winning\n   - They've now played Paper in back-to-back rounds even after losing to Rock\n   - This suggests they either haven't adapted or Paper is truly their preferred/default move\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Paper again (9 out of 20 rounds suggests high probability): Rock wins\n   - If they finally switch to Scissors: Rock loses\n   - If they switch to Rock: Tie\n   - The math still favors playing Rock\n\n7.

Analyze the pattern:\n   - They have played Paper in rounds 19, 20, and 21 consecutively\n   - My Rock has beaten their Paper three times in a row\n   - They seem committed to Paper despite losing repeatedly\n\n3. Updated frequency analysis after round 21:\n   - Paper: 10 times (now almost half their moves!)\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper is now 10 out of 21 rounds = 47.6% of their total moves\n\n4. The strategy validation:\n   - The simple \"play Rock to beat Paper\" approach has given me three consecutive wins\n   - This is the longest winning streak I've had in the entire game\n   - The statistical approach is proving more effective than any pattern analysis I tried\n\n5. Decision point - the big question:\n   - Do I stick with Rock for a fourth time?\n   - Surely they must adapt after losing three straight rounds to the same move?\n   - But then again, this is exactly the overthinking that got me into trouble before\n\n6. What the evidence shows:\n   - They've played Paper three times in a row even while losing\n   - Paper remains by far their most frequent choice overall\n   - My simple strategy has been perfectly successful\n   - There's no evidence they're adapting despite repeated losses\n\n7. Psychological consideration:\n   - It's tempting to think \"they MUST switch now\"\n   - But that's prediction-based thinking, which failed me for many rounds\n   - The data-driven approach (play against most frequent move) is working\n   - Trust the method, not the speculation\n\n8.

After playing rock in round 17, if they continue the alternation, scissors would be next.\n\nTheir current count:\n- Paper: 3 times \n- Scissors: 8 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n\nThe scissors/rock alternation seems to be reasserting itself after the brief paper detour. Following this pattern, scissors should be next after rock.\n\n[move] paper",
