    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where I want to maximize points (+1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for tie).\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have any established patterns or strategy yet.\n\n3. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. For the first move against an unknown player, I should consider:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first choice people think of)\n   - Paper beats rock, so if they choose rock, I win\n   - If they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of losing, 1/3 of tying\n\n5. There's no clear optimal strategy for a single round against an unknown opponent, but starting with paper gives me an advantage if they follow the common beginner tendency to play rock first.\n\n6. I'll go with paper as my opening move to potentially capitalize on a common beginner pattern.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper\n\n[move] Paper"

Wait - that's incorrect according to the rules. Paper beats rock, so I should have won, not lost.\n\n2. Let me re-read the rules: \"paper beats scissors\", \"rock beats paper\", \"scissors beats rock\". So rock beats paper, not the other way around like in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n3. This means the payoff structure is:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n4. My opponent played rock in round 1. Now I need to predict their round 2 move.\n\n5. Since they won with rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock (if they think it's a \"winning\" move)\n   - Switch to try something different\n   - Have no particular pattern as a fresh player\n\n6. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n\n7. If they switch, it's a 50/50 between paper and scissors. Against paper I'd want rock, against scissors I'd want paper.\n\n8. Given that they just won with rock, there's a reasonable chance they might repeat it, especially as a fresh player who found success.\n\n9.

Historical behavior after I break their streaks:\n   - After I beat their paper in round 6, they went: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They didn't immediately abandon scissors, but mixed it with other moves\n\n5. Prediction for round 12:\n   - They might abandon scissors since it just lost (similar to how they eventually moved away from paper after it lost)\n   - They could return to paper or rock\n   - Given their tendency to cycle between moves, they might go back to paper or rock\n\n6. Since scissors just failed them and they've historically switched after losses, I expect them to move away from scissors. They might return to paper (their other frequently used move) or rock.\n\n7. If they go to paper: I need rock\n   If they go to rock: I need scissors\n   \n8.

Critical observation:\n   - They did NOT switch after losing with scissors in round 17\n   - Instead, they stuck with scissors in round 18 and it won\n   - This breaks their earlier pattern of switching after losses\n\n4. Updated frequency after 18 rounds:\n   - Scissors: 9 times (heavily dominant now)\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n\n5. New pattern recognition:\n   - They seem to have shifted to favoring scissors heavily\n   - Even after it lost in round 17, they immediately went back to it in round 18\n   - Scissors is now 50% of their total moves (9 out of 18)\n\n6. Strategic insight:\n   - They appear to have found their \"preferred\" move in scissors\n   - Rather than switching after losses, they're sticking with their dominant strategy\n   - Scissors just won again in round 18, reinforcing this choice\n\n7. Prediction for round 19:\n   - Given their heavy bias toward scissors and that it just won again, they'll likely stick with scissors\n   - They've now played scissors in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - To beat scissors: I need paper\n\n8. I should counter their apparent scissors preference with paper.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat scissors\n\n[move] Paper"

Prediction approach:\n   - Rather than overthinking their pattern, I'll make a less predictable choice\n   - I've been alternating between paper and rock recently\n   - I'll try scissors to break my own pattern\n\n8.

Historical pattern with successful moves:\n   - Earlier in the game, they would repeat winning moves multiple times\n   - Paper just had success (win then tie), so they might continue with it\n\n7.
