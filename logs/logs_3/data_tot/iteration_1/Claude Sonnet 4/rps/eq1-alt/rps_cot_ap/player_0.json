    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they haven't played before or don't have experience.\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n4. Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns:\n   - Many beginners start with \"rock\" as it feels like the strongest/most aggressive choice\n   - Some might choose \"scissors\" thinking it's unexpected\n   - \"Paper\" is often considered less intuitive as a first choice\n5. Given that rock is a common first choice for beginners, I should choose paper to beat rock.\n6. This gives me the best chance of winning 1 point in this opening round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

I predicted the opponent would choose rock, and they did choose rock, but I lost because I chose paper.\n2. Wait - that's incorrect according to the rules. Paper beats rock, so I should have won, not lost.\n3. Let me re-read the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n4. Ah, I misunderstood the rules! In this version: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock.\n5. This is the reverse of traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n6. So the opponent chose rock, I chose paper, and rock beat paper - that's why I lost.\n7. Now for round 2: The opponent showed they're willing to choose rock. They might stick with what worked, or they might switch.\n8. If they stick with rock again, I need to choose scissors to beat rock.\n9. If they think I'll expect rock and switch to paper, then I should choose rock to beat paper.\n10. If they switch to scissors, then I should choose paper to beat scissors.\n11.

Pattern update:\n   - Rock (4 rounds) \u2192 Paper (3 rounds) \u2192 Scissors (4 rounds) \u2192 Rock (2 rounds) \u2192 Paper (3 rounds) \u2192 Scissors (2 rounds) \u2192 Rock (4 rounds) \u2192 Paper (1 round so far)\n2. Current total score: +10 + 1 = +11 points\n3. The opponent has perfectly followed the cycling pattern and switched to paper after completing their 4-round rock sequence.\n4. Updated pattern analysis:\n   - First cycle: Rock (4), Paper (3), Scissors (4)\n   - Second cycle: Rock (2), Paper (3), Scissors (2), Rock (4), Paper (1 so far)\n5. In both previous paper sequences, they played paper for exactly 3 rounds.\n6. This suggests they'll likely continue paper for 2 more rounds to complete a 3-round paper sequence.\n7. If they continue paper (very likely based on their established 3-round paper pattern), I should play rock to win.\n8. If they unexpectedly switch early to scissors, I should play paper.\n9. If they somehow go back to rock, I should play scissors.\n10. The evidence strongly supports continuing paper for multiple rounds, as they've consistently played paper for 3 rounds in previous sequences.\n11. Their multi-round approach and the established 3-round paper pattern make rock the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat paper, expecting them to continue their paper sequence for at least one more round based on their consistent 3-round paper pattern.\n\n[move] rock"
