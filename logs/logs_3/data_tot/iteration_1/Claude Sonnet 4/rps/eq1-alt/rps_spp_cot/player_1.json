    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a zero-sum game where I win +1 point when I beat my opponent, lose -1 point when they beat me, and get 0 points for ties\n   - The moves follow standard rock-paper-scissors rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they are new/inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or tendencies\n\n3. Think about common first-move patterns:\n   - New players frequently choose rock as their first move (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - Rock is also commonly chosen because it feels \"strong\" or \"aggressive\"\n   - Some beginners might choose scissors, but rock is statistically the most common first choice\n\n4. Determine my optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat rock\n   - This gives me the best probability of winning +1 point on the first move\n   - Even if I'm wrong, I only risk losing 1 point, but the upside is worth it\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper to counter the most likely rock choice from a fresh player\n\n[move] paper"

Update my understanding of the opponent:\n   - The opponent chose paper, not rock as I predicted\n   - This could mean they're either more strategic than I thought, or they have different tendencies than typical beginners\n   - They might have been thinking similarly to me (expecting me to expect rock)\n\n3. Consider possible opponent patterns:\n   - They might stick with paper again (some players repeat successful/neutral moves)\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might go to scissors (completing a cycle or trying to counter my potential paper repeat)\n\n4. Think about meta-game considerations:\n   - Since we tied, they know I chose paper too\n   - They might expect me to change my move\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with what \"worked\" (didn't lose)\n\n5.

Consider opponent's perspective:\n   - They've seen me win with rock twice now against their paper\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it's been successful)\n   - If they expect rock, they might counter with paper again\n   - Or they might finally switch to scissors to beat my expected rock\n\n5. Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - If opponent plays paper again (their most common move), I need scissors\n   - If opponent plays scissors (to counter expected rock), I need rock\n   - If opponent plays rock, I need scissors\n   - Scissors wins against both paper and rock\n\n6. Consider meta-game dynamics:\n   - My rock has been successful lately, but overusing it makes me predictable\n   - Opponent seems to have a paper bias/preference\n   - Breaking from rock while opponent might still expect it could be effective\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - Scissors beats paper (their most frequent choice) and rock\n   - Only loses to paper, but opponent seems committed to paper\n   - Wait - that's wrong. Scissors loses to paper, not rock\n   - Let me reconsider: scissors beats rock, loses to paper\n   - Since opponent favors paper, scissors might not be optimal\n   - If they play paper again, I need scissors. But paper beats scissors.\n   - I need rock to beat paper.\n\nLet me correct: If opponent plays paper (likely), rock beats paper. I should stick with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

Recognize the opponent's adaptation:\n   - They caught on to my rock strategy\n   - They switched from paper to scissors specifically to beat rock\n   - This shows they're actively counter-strategizing\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - If they continue the paper-scissors alternation, next would be paper\n   - If they think I'll switch away from rock (since it just lost), they might stick with scissors\n   - If they expect me to counter their scissors with rock, they might go to paper\n\n6. Consider my optimal response:\n   - If opponent plays paper, I need scissors to win\n   - If opponent plays scissors again, I need rock to win\n   - If opponent plays rock, I need scissors to win\n   - Given their recent paper-scissors pattern, paper seems likely next\n\n7.

Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 5 moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to be cycling: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - Two scissors in a row now (rounds 10 and 11)\n\n3. Notice the tie pattern:\n   - We've tied twice, both times with scissors (rounds 8 and 11)\n   - This suggests we're sometimes thinking similarly about the game state\n\n4. Consider opponent's current strategy:\n   - They just played scissors twice in a row\n   - They might continue with scissors (going for three in a row)\n   - Or they might switch, thinking I'll expect scissors and counter with rock\n   - Or they might go back to paper (their most frequent choice overall)\n\n5. Analyze what opponent knows about me:\n   - I just switched from rock to scissors (breaking my rock pattern)\n   - We tied with scissors, so they know I'm willing to play scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch away from scissors since the tie didn't help my score\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again, I need rock to win\n   - If opponent switches to paper, I need scissors to win\n   - If opponent switches to rock, I need scissors to win\n   - Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and rock\n\nWait, let me double-check: scissors beats rock, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper.\n\nSo:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again, I need rock to win (rock beats scissors? No - scissors beats rock)\n   - Actually: if opponent plays scissors, scissors beats rock, so I need paper to win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I need scissors to win  \n   - If opponent plays rock, I need scissors to win\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since opponent just played scissors twice, they might stick with it\n   - To beat scissors, I need paper\n   - Paper also loses to scissors, so this is risky, but scissors twice in a row suggests continuation\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied 3 times out of 12 rounds (25% tie rate)\n   - All ties: paper-paper, scissors-scissors, scissors-scissors, paper-paper\n   - This suggests we're thinking similarly or there's some convergent strategy\n\n3.

Identify the current dynamic:\n   - Both players seem to be avoiding rock lately\n   - Recent moves focus on paper and scissors\n   - We're both adapting and counter-adapting to each other\n\n5.

Update my game record:\n   - Current score after 18 rounds: +2 points (was +1, won +1)\n   - Last round: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - My winning streak continues perfectly\n\n2. Confirm the pattern reliability:\n   - Opponent's last 8 moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Absolutely perfect alternating pattern for 8 consecutive rounds\n   - They just played scissors, so paper should be next\n\n3. Review my dominant performance:\n   - Round 15: Won with rock vs paper (+1)\n   - Round 16: Won with paper vs scissors (+1)\n   - Round 17: Won with rock vs paper (+1)\n   - Round 18: Won with paper vs scissors (+1)\n   - Perfect 4-0 streak by reading their pattern\n\n4. Assess the situation:\n   - The opponent is completely locked into this alternating cycle\n   - They seem unaware of how predictable they've become\n   - This is an extremely exploitable pattern\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Following the strict alternating pattern: after scissors comes paper\n   - Maximum confidence this will be paper\n   - They've shown no deviation from this pattern\n\n6. Determine optimal counter:\n   - If opponent plays paper (virtually certain), I need rock to win (rock beats paper)\n   - This follows the same successful strategy I've been using\n\n7. Consider potential risks:\n   - After losing 4 in a row, opponent might finally recognize the pattern\n   - But breaking deeply ingrained patterns is psychologically difficult\n   - I should continue exploiting until I see actual evidence of change\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - Choose rock to beat paper\n   - Extend my winning streak to 5 by continuing to exploit their predictable alternating pattern\n   - This strategy has been 100% successful\n\n[move] rock"

Update my game record:\n   - Current score after 19 rounds: +2 points (was +2, tied 0)\n   - Last round: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - My winning streak ended, but they broke their pattern\n\n2. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Expected: opponent plays paper (following alternating pattern)\n   - Actually: opponent played rock (completely new move in recent rounds)\n   - This is the first time they've played rock in many rounds\n   - They've finally adapted/broken out of their alternating cycle\n\n3. Review what this means:\n   - Opponent may have realized they were being too predictable\n   - They might be trying to throw me off by introducing rock\n   - The reliable paper-scissors alternating pattern is now broken\n   - I need to adapt my strategy immediately\n\n4. Consider opponent's new strategy:\n   - They just played rock for the first time in a while\n   - They might continue with rock, thinking I'll expect a return to the pattern\n   - They might go back to paper or scissors\n   - They might try to establish a new pattern or be truly random\n\n5. Analyze what they know about me:\n   - They've seen me win 4 in a row by perfectly countering their moves\n   - They may have realized I was reading their pattern\n   - They know I just played rock (same as them)\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock or change\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Could be rock again (doubling down on the pattern break)\n   - Could return to paper (going back to familiar territory)\n   - Could be scissors (completing the cycle they've avoided)\n   - Much less predictable now\n\n7. Determine strategy:\n   - Since they broke the pattern, I need to think more dynamically\n   - Rock appeared for the first time - they might stick with it\n   - If they play rock again, I need scissors to win\n   - If they return to paper, I need rock to win\n   - If they play scissors, I need rock to win\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty, I'll choose scissors to beat rock (in case they repeat)\n   - This covers the new element they introduced\n\n[move] scissors"

Update my game record:\n   - Current score after 20 rounds: +2 points (was +2, tied 0)\n   - Last round: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Two ties in a row: rock-rock, then scissors-scissors\n\n2. Analyze the new dynamic:\n   - Opponent's last 3 moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They've completely abandoned the paper-scissors alternating pattern\n   - Now showing rock and maintaining scissors usage\n   - The predictable pattern era is over\n\n3. Review recent developments:\n   - Round 18: I won, opponent played scissors (last of old pattern)\n   - Round 19: Tie with rock (opponent's pattern break)\n   - Round 20: Tie with scissors (we're thinking similarly again)\n   - Opponent is now much less predictable\n\n4. Consider the psychological shift:\n   - Two consecutive ties suggest we're both adjusting strategies\n   - They may be trying to read my moves now\n   - The dynamic has shifted from me exploiting them to mutual adaptation\n   - They're no longer locked into a simple pattern\n\n5. Analyze what they might expect:\n   - We just both played scissors\n   - They might think I'll switch away from scissors (to avoid another tie)\n   - They might expect me to go to rock (which was successful before)\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with scissors\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock (expecting me to change), I need scissors to win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I need rock to win\n   - If opponent plays scissors again, we tie\n   - The game has become much more strategic and less predictable\n\n7. Think about mixed strategy:\n   - Since patterns are less reliable now, I should focus on what gives me the best expected value\n   - Rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock\n   - Without clear patterns, each move has equal probability in theory\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - I'll choose rock to break away from the scissors tie\n   - Rock covers paper (if they try to counter my potential scissors repeat)\n   - This avoids the tie scenario and gives me a chance to win\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - Last 4 moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They're now using all three moves without a clear pattern\n   - Just returned to paper after trying rock and scissors\n   - No longer predictably alternating\n\n3. Review the strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: opponent had paper-scissors alternating pattern\n   - I exploited it for 4 straight wins\n   - They broke the pattern with rock, leading to ties\n   - Now they're back to paper, and I successfully countered with rock\n\n4. Consider opponent's current mindset:\n   - They just lost after breaking their pattern successfully (causing ties)\n   - They might think their paper choice was wrong\n   - They could return to rock (which caused the tie before)\n   - Or try scissors to complete a cycle\n   - Or stick with paper thinking I won't expect it again\n\n5. Analyze what they know about me:\n   - I just played rock and beat their paper\n   - They know I can adapt when they change strategies\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just won)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to avoid being predictable\n\n6. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - If they expect me to repeat rock, they might play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they try to be unpredictable, could be any move\n   - Rock caused them success (ties) before, so they might return to it\n   - Paper just failed, so less likely to repeat immediately\n\n7. Determine optimal counter:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (to counter expected rock), I need rock to win\n   - Wait - scissors beats rock, so if they play scissors, I need paper to win\n   - If opponent plays rock, I need scissors to win\n   - If opponent plays paper, I need rock to win\n\n8.

Review opponent's recent moves:\n   - Last 5 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They're cycling through all moves, showing tactical thinking\n   - Just played scissors (trying to counter my rock)\n   - No longer following simple patterns\n\n4.
