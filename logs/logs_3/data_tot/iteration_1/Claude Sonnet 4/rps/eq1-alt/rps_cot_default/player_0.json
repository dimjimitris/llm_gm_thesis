    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the pattern more clearly:\n   - Looking at the full sequence: Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock\n   - It seems like they're trying to cycle Rock-Scissors-Paper but with some irregularities\n   - Recent pattern shows: Paper, Rock - so if continuing the cycle, next might be Scissors\n\n4. Consider alternative patterns:\n   - They've played Rock 4 times (rounds 1, 4, 6, 8)\n   - They've played Scissors 2 times (rounds 2, 5) \n   - They've played Paper 2 times (rounds 3, 7)\n   - Rock is their most frequent choice\n\n5. Predict next move:\n   - If following Rock-Scissors-Paper cycle from current Rock, next should be Scissors\n   - If they continue favoring Rock, they might play Rock again\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Rock (rock beats scissors - wait, let me double-check)\n   - From round 5: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 Scissors won, so scissors beats rock\n   - If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Expecting Scissors based on the cycle pattern, I'll play Paper\n\n[move] (Following the cycling pattern, opponent should play scissors next after rock) paper"

Examine the pattern shift:\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more adaptive\n   - My Scissors strategy worked great initially but is now being countered\n\n5. Consider their psychology:\n   - They successfully countered my Scissors with Paper\n   - They might continue with Paper if they think I'll stick with Scissors\n   - Or they might return to Rock, thinking I'll switch strategies\n   - Or they might try Scissors to create more unpredictability\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with Paper (expecting me to repeat Scissors), I should play Rock\n   - If they return to Rock (thinking I'll abandon Scissors), I should play Scissors\n   - If they try Scissors (for variety), I should play Rock\n   - Rock seems like the strongest choice as it beats both Paper and Scissors\n   - This also breaks my predictable Scissors pattern\n\n[move] (Opponent has adapted by using paper to counter my successful scissors strategy, switching to rock to counter their likely continued paper play) rock"
