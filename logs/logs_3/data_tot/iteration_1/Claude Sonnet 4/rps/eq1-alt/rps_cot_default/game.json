Notice the Rock dominance:\n   - Last 3 rounds: Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - They seem to be gravitating toward Rock as their preferred move\n   - Rock appeared in 5 out of 9 rounds total\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - If they continue favoring Rock, I should play Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Rock (confirmed from rounds 6 and 8 where I won with scissors vs their rock)\n   - Even if they don't play Rock, Scissors is a good hedge since it also beats Rock if they repeat\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - Play Scissors to counter the likely Rock move\n\n[move] (Opponent has been favoring rock lately, especially in the last two rounds) scissors"

Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with Paper (expecting me to repeat Scissors), I should play Rock\n   - If they return to Rock (thinking I'll abandon Scissors), I should play Scissors\n   - If they try Scissors (for variety), I should play Rock\n   - Rock seems like the strongest choice as it beats both Paper and Scissors\n   - This also breaks my predictable Scissors pattern\n\n[move] (Opponent has adapted by using paper to counter my successful scissors strategy, switching to rock to counter their likely continued paper play) rock"

Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and opponent -1 point\n   - This maximizes my score while minimizing opponent's score\n\n5.

Review the current game state:\n   - Current total after 22 rounds: +1 points\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n\n2. Analyze opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15 (7 times)\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 5, 10, 14, 18, 20 (6 times)\n   - Paper: rounds 3, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22 (9 times)\n\n3.

Examine their Paper persistence:\n   - They've now played Paper 5 times in the last 7 rounds\n   - Despite losing to my Rock multiple times, they keep returning to Paper\n   - This shows remarkable commitment to their Paper strategy\n\n5. Recognize my misread:\n   - I expected them to switch after repeated Paper losses\n   - Instead, they doubled down on Paper\n   - This opponent is more stubborn/committed than I anticipated\n\n6. Analyze the effectiveness patterns:\n   - My Rock beats their Paper consistently\n   - When I deviate from Rock (like just now with Scissors), they win with Paper\n   - They seem committed to Paper regardless of results\n\n7. Consider their psychology:\n   - They might be testing whether I'll stick with the Rock counter-strategy\n   - Or they genuinely believe Paper is their best long-term strategy\n   - Their persistence suggests they won't easily abandon Paper\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Given their strong Paper commitment (9/22 rounds, 5/7 recent rounds)\n   - And my proven success with Rock against their Paper\n   - I should return to the Rock strategy that has worked so well\n   - Rock beats Paper, and they're likely to continue with Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent shows remarkable commitment to paper strategy despite losses, returning to rock which has consistently beaten their paper) rock",

Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just lost with Rock, but Rock is still their preferred move\n   - They might stick with Rock (their comfort zone)\n   - Or they might try to switch since Rock just failed\n   - Given their overall pattern, Rock remains most likely\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with Scissors since it beats Rock\n   - This has been working well for me (won rounds 6, 8, 11 with scissors vs rock)\n   - Even if they switch, I'm playing the odds based on their clear preference\n\n[move] (Opponent strongly favors rock and just played it again, continuing with my successful counter) scissors",
