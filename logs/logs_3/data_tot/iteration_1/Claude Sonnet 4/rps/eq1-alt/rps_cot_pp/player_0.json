    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns - they might default to rock (most common first choice), or choose randomly without much strategy.\n5. Since rock is statistically the most common opening move for new players, I should choose paper to counter it.\n6. This gives me the best chance of winning the first round with +1 points.\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - which is fair odds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my opening move to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests either: (a) they're not as predictable as I thought, (b) they might be trying to counter what they think I'll do, or (c) it was a random choice.\n6. Since I only have one data point, I shouldn't read too much into their choice yet.\n7. For this round, I should consider that they might try to counter my previous move (paper) by choosing scissors again, or they might switch strategies entirely.\n8.

If they continue this pattern, the next logical move in rock-paper-scissors rotation could be paper.\n4. However, I shouldn't assume they're following a strict rotation - they might be trying to be unpredictable.\n5. Since they've now used scissors and rock, they haven't used paper yet. They might complete the set with paper, or they might repeat one of their previous moves.\n6. If they choose paper (completing the set), I should choose scissors to beat it.\n7. If they repeat rock (their last move), I should choose paper to beat it.\n8. If they repeat scissors (their first move), I should choose rock to beat it.\n9. Given that many players tend to avoid immediate repetition after a tie, paper seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move.\n10.

To beat paper, I need rock (since rock beats paper according to the rules).\n\n6. If my opponent plays paper as predicted, my rock will beat their paper and I'll win +1 points.\n\n7. This opponent has demonstrated complete algorithmic behavior across 23 rounds with zero deviation from their three-move cycle.\n\n8. I'll continue exploiting this deterministic pattern for my nineteenth consecutive win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their predicted paper move in the cycle.\n\n[move] rock"
