Let me update:\n\nRound 1: They played rock (tie with my rock)\nRound 2: They played scissors (I won with paper)\nRound 3: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 4: They played rock (tie with my rock)\nRound 5: They played scissors (I won with paper)\nRound 6: They played rock (they won with rock vs my paper)\nRound 7: They played rock (tie with my rock)\nRound 8: They played rock (they won with rock vs my paper)\nRound 9: They played rock (tie with my rock)\nRound 10: They played rock (they won with rock vs my paper)\nRound 11: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 12: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 13: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 14: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 15: They played rock (I won with scissors)\nRound 16: They played paper (they won with paper vs my scissors)\nRound 17: They played paper (I won with rock)\nRound 18: They played paper (I won with rock)\nRound 19: They played paper (I won with rock)\nRound 20: They played scissors (they won with scissors vs my rock)\nRound 21: They played scissors (I won with paper)\nRound 22: They played scissors (I won with paper)\nRound 23: They played scissors (I won with paper)\n\nTheir sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\nThe streak pattern remains very strong:\n- Rock: 13 times, Scissors: 6 times, Paper: 4 times\n- 10-round rock streak (rounds 6-15)\n- 4-round paper streak (rounds 16-19)\n- Now 4-round scissors streak (rounds 20-23)\n\nInterestingly, their scissors streak has now matched their paper streak length (4 rounds). If they follow the same pattern as the paper streak, they might switch to a new move soon. However, their rock streak was much longer (10 rounds), so they could continue with scissors for several more rounds.\n\nGiven their strong tendency to play in streaks and they're currently committed to scissors, I'll continue with paper.\n\n[move] paper"
