    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - I have no prior history with this player to predict patterns\n\n3. Think about optimal strategy for a first move:\n   - Against inexperienced players, rock is statistically the most common first move\n   - Many beginners default to rock as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - If my opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose (-1 point)\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If I'm right and they choose rock, I win (+1 point)\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - The statistical tendency for beginners to choose rock makes paper a reasonable first move\n   - Even if wrong, the worst case is -1 point, and I can adjust strategy in future rounds\n\n[move] Paper - Playing the odds that a fresh player will start with rock, which is the most common opening move for beginners."

Review the previous round:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie (0 points for both)\n   - My assumption that a \"fresh player\" would choose rock was incorrect\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine\n   - They may have expected me to choose rock and countered with paper\n   - Or they could have been thinking that I would expect them to choose rock, so they chose paper\n   - This indicates more strategic thinking than a typical beginner\n\n3. Consider the psychological element:\n   - Now that we both played paper, what might they think I'll do next?\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies after the tie\n   - Common patterns after ties include: staying with the same move, or switching to counter what they think I'll switch to\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I stay with paper and they stay with paper: another tie\n   - If I switch to rock and they expect me to switch to rock: they might play paper again to beat me\n   - If I switch to scissors: this beats paper if they stick with their previous choice\n\n5.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they continue with rock (their most frequent move), paper beats rock\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting me to play rock again), scissors beats paper  \n   - If they switch to scissors (completing a cycle), rock beats scissors\n   - Given that rock is their most-used move and we just tied with it, they might either repeat it or expect me to counter with paper\n   - Paper seems like the safest choice - it beats their favored rock and only loses to scissors\n\n[move] Paper - Playing to counter rock, which has become their most frequent move, and expecting they might stick with their preferred choice despite the recent tie."

Analyze my opponent's adaptation:\n   - They switched from rock to paper, exactly as I predicted\n   - Their pattern: Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper\n   - Move frequency: Paper (6x), Rock (9x), Scissors (2x)\n   - They finally adapted to counter my scissors wins by switching to paper\n   - This shows they are capable of strategic thinking and adaptation\n\n3. Consider what they might think now:\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock\n   - They tried to counter my scissors and it backfired\n   - They might go back to rock (their comfort zone)\n   - Or they might think I'll expect rock and try something else\n   - They might finally try scissors, which they've barely used (2/17 = 12%)\n\n4. Look at recent patterns:\n   - Their last 5 moves: Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper\n   - After switching to paper and losing, they might revert to rock\n   - Or they might continue trying to counter my strategies\n   - Scissors remains their most underused move\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they go back to rock (likely, given their preference), scissors beats rock\n   - If they stick with paper (trying to counter potential scissors), rock beats paper\n   - If they finally try scissors (overdue statistically), rock beats scissors\n   - Rock seems like the safest play - it beats both paper and scissors\n   - But if they revert to their rock obsession, scissors would win\n   - Given they just adapted with paper and lost, they might go back to their rock comfort zone\n   - I should exploit their likely return to rock with scissors\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting the opponent to revert to their dominant rock strategy after their paper adaptation failed, since rock has been their comfort zone throughout the game."

Analyze my opponent's adaptation:\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - My opponent's pattern: Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - Updated frequency: Paper (7x), Rock (9x), Scissors (2x)\n   - They've now shifted toward paper more consistently\n\n3. Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - My opponent is adapting more than I initially thought\n   - They're countering my scissors strategy with paper\n   - They might have realized scissors was working against their rock preference\n   - Two papers in a row suggests they might be shifting their primary strategy\n\n4. Consider their next likely move:\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch from scissors to counter paper\n   - To beat paper, I need scissors... but they just beat my scissors with paper\n   - They might expect me to play rock (which beats paper) and counter with scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper since it just worked\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they stick with paper (continuing recent success), scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to rock (reverting to old pattern), scissors beats rock  \n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock to beat paper), rock beats scissors\n   - Wait - I need to double-check: scissors beats paper, not the other way around\n   - Actually, let me verify: paper beats scissors (correct, that's why I lost)\n   - So if they stick with paper, I need rock to beat paper\n   - If they go back to rock, paper beats rock\n   - Rock seems safer since it beats their recent paper preference\n\n[move] Rock - Countering their recent shift toward paper, which has been successful for them in the last two rounds, since rock beats paper."

Look at the tie pattern:\n   - We've now had 9 ties out of 19 rounds (47% tie rate)\n   - This high tie rate suggests we're both using similar logical patterns\n   - They seem to be getting better at predicting or matching my moves\n\n4. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Heavy rock preference\n   - Mid game: Stuck with rock even when losing to scissors\n   - Recent: Adapting with paper to counter scissors, now mixing rock and paper\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue alternating between rock and paper, scissors is underrepresented\n   - They've only used scissors 2 out of 19 times (10.5%)\n   - Scissors beats rock, loses to paper\n   - Given their recent rock-paper mixing, I need to pick what covers both scenarios best\n   - If they play rock (likely given their preference), scissors wins\n   - If they play paper (continuing recent adaptation), I lose with scissors\n   - But statistically, rock is still more likely (10/19 vs 7/19)\n   - However, they might expect me to counter rock with scissors and play paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so if I expect paper, I should play scissors... no wait, that's backwards\n   - If I expect paper, I should play scissors to beat paper... no, scissors loses to paper\n   - If I expect paper, I should play scissors to beat it... let me double-check the rules again\n   - Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n   - So if I expect paper, I need rock to beat it\n\n[move] Paper - Expecting them to stick with rock since it's still their most frequent move (10/19), and paper beats rock while also being ready for a strategic shift in their play pattern."
