You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me double-check:\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper  \n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo paper DOES beat scissors! I had this backwards. Let me recalculate my understanding:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis means when I played scissors against their paper, I should lose, which matches the result.\n\nUpdated opponent sequence: rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper\n\nThey just played paper. Given their recent mixing pattern and the fact that paper just beat my scissors, they might stick with paper since it worked, or they might switch.\n\nIf they play paper again, I need rock to beat it (since rock beats paper).\n\n[move] rock"
