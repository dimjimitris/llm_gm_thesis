Let me analyze what just happened:\n\nMy opponent's recent moves: rock, scissors, scissors, scissors\n\nThey played scissors again, which beat my rock. They've now played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds, with scissors winning 3 of those times (2 ties with me, 1 win against my rock).\n\nThis opponent seems to have identified that scissors is working well for them lately. They might be:\n1. Recognizing that I keep switching strategies and scissors gives them good coverage\n2. Settled into a scissors-heavy approach\n3. Expecting me to keep changing moves\n\nMy current score is quite negative from all these losses. I need to start winning more consistently.\n\nIf they continue with their recent scissors preference, I need paper to beat scissors. Given that they've played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds and just won with it, they might stick with this successful strategy.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me update the pattern:\n\nMy opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n\nThey played scissors in 5 consecutive rounds before I just beat it with paper. This confirms they had settled into a scissors-heavy strategy, likely because:\n1. It was working well against my frequent strategy changes\n2. Scissors tied with me twice and beat my rock\n\nNow that I just beat their scissors with paper, this adaptive opponent will likely adjust. They might:\n1. Switch to rock to beat my paper (most likely given their reactive nature)\n2. Continue with scissors hoping I won't stick with paper\n3. Switch to paper themselves\n\nGiven how quickly they've adapted throughout this game, I expect them to counter my successful paper with rock. To beat rock, I need scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"
