    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Considering the payoffs:\n- Paper has highest potential gain (3 points vs rock)\n- Paper also has moderate risk (-1 vs scissors)\n- Rock has high risk (-3 vs paper) but low risk (-1 vs scissors)\n- Scissors has only moderate outcomes (\u00b11 points)\n\n4. For a first move with no prior information:\n- Paper offers the highest potential reward\n- The risk of losing 1 point to scissors is acceptable given the potential 3-point gain\n\n5.

Considering possible responses:\n- If I play paper again: 0 points if they stick to paper, -1 if they switch to scissors, +3 if they switch to rock\n- If I play scissors: +1 if they stick to paper, 0 if they switch to scissors, -1 if they switch to rock\n- If I play rock: -3 if they stick to paper, +1 if they switch to scissors, 0 if they switch to rock\n\n4.

Risk/Reward analysis for my options:\n- Rock: Safest against scissors (+1) but worst against paper (-3)\n- Paper: Best gain against rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: We already tied with this twice, might be predictable\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock\n- It beats scissors if they continue the pattern (+1)\n- If they try to outthink me and choose paper, the loss is significant (-3)\n- But given the observed pattern and psychology, rock seems most logical\n- Breaking the mirroring pattern might be advantageous\n\n[move] rock\n"

Risk assessment:\n- Playing paper again would be extremely risky\n- They've lost twice to paper, unlikely to let it happen again\n- They either must switch away from scissors or they're completely tilted\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock\n- If they stick with scissors (showing tilt), I win (+1)\n- If they switch to paper (logical counter to rock), I lose (-3)\n- If they switch to rock (playing safe), we tie\n- Given their recent losses, they're unlikely to make an aggressive paper play\n- Most likely they either stick with scissors or switch to rock\n- Rock gives me the best coverage against their most likely moves\n- This continues my unpredictable pattern by not repeating paper\n\n[move] rock\n"
