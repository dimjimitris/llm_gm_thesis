Instead of trying to out-think the pattern, I'll choose scissors - it's the least obvious choice after mutual rock plays:\n\n[move] scissors Breaking pattern with scissors - when both players are this synchronized, sometimes the best strategy is to make the least expected move.\n"

Starting with mirroring to study patterns\n2. Breaking away with superior predictions\n3. Using rock effectively for maximum points\n4. Avoiding predictable patterns themselves\n\n[move] scissors\nI'm choosing scissors because:\n1. After two consecutive wins (with scissors then rock), they might get confident and play paper\n2.
