Complete game history pattern:\n   * Recent focus on last three rounds:\n   * Round 9: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   * Round 10: rock vs scissors (lost, -1)\n   * Round 11: scissors vs rock (won, 1)\n   * Current net score: 1 point\n   * Game showing high volatility\n\n2. Opponent's behavioral analysis:\n   * Their last three: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   * They've shown willingness to switch strategies\n   * They seem to be trying to counter my moves\n   * Just switched back to rock after multiple scissors plays\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They just lost after switching to rock\n   * Might be frustrated and looking for a big win\n   * Could expect me to stay with winning scissors move\n   * Might try to get maximum points with rock again\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * If they stick with rock expecting scissors, paper wins big (3 points)\n   * If they try to counter expected scissors with rock, paper still wins\n   * If they predict paper and use scissors, we lose only 1 point\n   * Maximum loss scenario is manageable\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * I will play paper\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Strong counter to their recent rock play\n     - High reward potential (3 points) if they repeat rock\n     - Limited downside (-1) if they switch to scissors\n     - Takes advantage of their possible frustration\n     - They seem to favor rock in crucial moments\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Round 20: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   * Round 21: scissors vs rock (won, 1)\n   * Round 22: rock vs scissors (lost, -1)\n   * Round 23: paper vs paper (tie)\n   * Current net score: 6 points\n   * Pattern shows frequent ties recently\n\n2. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   * Their last three: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   * They've used all three moves in sequence\n   * Successfully matched my paper\n   * Showing strong adaptive ability\n\n3. Post-paper-tie psychology:\n   * After paper ties:\n     - Most players switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n     - Some switch to rock anticipating opponent's scissors\n   * Both players likely to switch from paper\n   * Complex mind games in play\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * If they follow common strategy, they'll play scissors\n   * If they think I'll expect scissors, they might play rock\n   * If they try to be clever, they might stick with paper\n   * Need to account for their good adaptive skills\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * I will play rock\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Counters the most likely move (scissors) after a paper tie\n     - If they play scissors (most common after paper tie), we win\n     - If they play paper again, we lose but only -3\n     - If they play rock, we tie\n     - Breaking the common pattern of switching to scissors after paper tie\n     - They've shown good prediction skills, so avoiding obvious scissors play\n     - With a solid point lead, can afford to make a strong defensive play\n     - Rock has been underutilized in recent rounds\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategy consideration:\n   - Without prior knowledge, I should avoid the highest risk move (Paper)\n   - Rock offers potential for high reward if opponent plays Paper\n   - If opponent plays Scissors against Rock, I only lose 1 point\n\n5.

For a first move against an unknown player:\n   - Avoiding the riskiest option (paper) seems prudent\n   - Between rock and scissors, both have same risk/reward\n   - Rock is often a common first choice by players in RPS games\n\n5.

Key pattern identification:\n   - First time opponent has repeated a move consecutively (Scissors)\n   - My current total score is quite negative (-4 points)\n   - They might be shifting to a more aggressive strategy\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent has found success with Scissors (2 rounds in a row)\n   - They might be growing confident in their Scissors strategy\n   - However, three Scissors in a row would be extremely risky\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   After double Scissors play:\n   - They might triple down on Scissors (unlikely but possible)\n   - They might expect me to play Rock and counter with Paper\n   - They might expect me to overthink and play Paper\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock (my last play) failed against Scissors\n   - Paper is too risky against potential Scissors triple\n   - Scissors would neutralize their Scissors strategy\n   - Scissors also beats Paper if they try to counter expected Rock\n   - Breaking their momentum is priority\n\n[move] Scissors (Playing Scissors to counter potential third Scissors play while also covering Paper, their most logical counter to expected Rock)\n",

Critical pattern observation:\n   - They just played Scissors TWICE in a row\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of never repeating\n   - This is significant as it's their first repetition since early game\n\n3.

        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Complete history analysis:\n   Round 1-22: (Previous history noted)\n   Round 23: Opponent - Paper (tie)\n   Recent sequence: Won with \"wrong\" move \u2192 tied with \"right\" move\n\n2. Tie pattern analysis:\n   Previous tie sequences:\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Rock (R9/10)\n   - Paper tie \u2192 Rock (R12/13)\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Paper (R14/15)\n   - Paper tie \u2192 Rock (R18/19)\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Rock (R20/21)\n   - Now Paper tie...\n   Note: Rock has been their most common post-tie move\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They might notice I've recognized their post-tie Rock tendency\n   - They've shown ability to break their own patterns when detected\n   - The game is deep enough that multiple levels of mind games are in play\n   - Success has come from unconventional choices\n\n4. Current momentum:\n   - My \"incorrect\" plays have been most successful\n   - They seem to struggle most when I defy conventional strategy\n   - They might expect me to either:\n     a) Counter their expected Rock\n     b) Make another unconventional play\n     c) Try to counter their counter-strategy\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper would be risky against their post-tie Rock pattern\n   - Rock would be safe but predictable\n   - Scissors is the least expected move after a Paper tie\n   - Scissors also counters potential Paper if they break their pattern\n   - Time to maintain the strategy of unconventional plays\n\n[move] Scissors (Playing Scissors as an unexpected move that continues the successful strategy of unconventional plays while offering good coverage against potential moves)\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Complete history analysis:\n   Round 1-22: (Previous history noted)\n   Round 23: Opponent - Paper (tie)\n   Notable pattern: We're both mixing conventional and unconventional plays\n\n2. Tie situation analysis:\n   Recent tie sequences:\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Paper (R14/15)\n   - Paper tie \u2192 Rock (R18/19)\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Rock (R20/21)\n   - Now Paper tie...\n   Their post-tie moves have evolved from predictable to varied\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - We're deep in the game where meta-strategy dominates\n   - Both players have shown ability to think multiple levels ahead\n   - The tie interrupts my unconventional success pattern\n   - They might expect me to try another unconventional play\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   After Paper tie:\n   - They might expect Scissors (logical counter)\n   - They might play Rock to counter expected Scissors\n   - They might maintain Paper expecting mind games\n   - Historical patterns are becoming less reliable\n   - Need to consider that they're also analyzing all these levels\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Scissors would be the obvious counter to Paper\n   - Rock would protect against expected Scissors\n   - Paper would be highly unexpected after a Paper tie\n   - In this deep psychological game, the unexpected has worked\n   - But they might expect me to play unexpected\n   - Sometimes the most unexpected move is the expected one\n\n[move] Scissors (Playing Scissors as it's so obvious that it becomes unexpected, using the complexity of multi-level thinking to simplify the choice)\n"
