    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Analyst - For evaluating potential gains and losses\n3. Pattern Observer - For tracking and analyzing opponent behavior \n\nLet's collaborate:\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the payoff matrix, rock is the most rewarding move if it wins (+3), but also the most punishing if it loses (-3). Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1). Since we're playing against a fresh opponent with no history, we should consider a balanced opening strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the payoff analysis. Rock is high-risk/high-reward. Since this is the first move and we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, we should avoid the high-risk option. Between paper and scissors, which both have the same risk/reward ratio, paper has an advantage as it beats rock (the high-value move).\n\nPattern Observer: Since this is the first move, we can't rely on past patterns. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening. This makes paper a strategically sound choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all these factors - the balanced risk/reward ratio and the psychological advantage against potential rock-throwers - I agree that paper would be our best opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you all for the analysis. I agree that paper provides a good balance of risk and potential reward, while also countering the common opening move of rock.\n\n[move] paper Opening with a balanced strategy that protects against the common first-move rock while maintaining moderate risk.\n"

They might be an unconventional player. After losing, they might expect us to switch to rock to counter their scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: The previous round resulted in a moderate loss for them (-1). Players who experience losses sometimes become more risk-averse. However, they might also try to maximize potential gains to make up for their loss. We need to consider both possibilities.\n\nPattern Observer: Their choice of scissors in the first round could indicate:\n1. A strategic player who avoids common opening moves\n2. A player who prefers scissors as their go-to move\n3. A completely random player\nIn any case, they've shown they're willing to use scissors right from the start.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this information, rock would be a strong counter to their previous scissors move. If they stick with scissors, we win with a +1. If they anticipate our rock and switch to paper, we lose -3. If they try to predict us going scissors and play rock themselves, we lose -1.\n\nRisk Analyst: The risk/reward ratio favors rock here. Even in the worst-case scenario (opponent plays paper), we can only lose one round's worth of points. The potential gain from them repeating scissors outweighs the risk.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the analysis. Rock provides a good balance of countering their previous move while maintaining reasonable risk/reward ratio.\n\n[move] rock Countering their previous scissors move while maintaining reasonable risk exposure.\n"

Given the tie, they're likely to switch again\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've shown a pattern of changing moves and haven't used paper yet, they might consider paper as their next move. Additionally, many players tend to avoid repeating the same move after a tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict they'll use paper, scissors would be our optimal move:\n- If we're right (they play paper), we win +1\n- If they play rock again, we lose -1\n- If they play scissors, it's a tie (0)\nThis presents a balanced risk profile with positive potential.\n\nPattern Observer: The opponent seems strategic rather than random, and their pattern suggests they're likely to switch after the tie.

After two paper ties, a switch is highly likely.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and the psychological pressure after two paper ties, I believe they're most likely to switch to scissors to counter expected paper. Therefore, rock provides our best option.\n\n[move] rock Anticipating their switch to scissors after consecutive paper ties, while accepting the calculated risk of them maintaining paper.\n"
