    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (me): Coordinates the discussion and makes the final decision\n\nLet's begin the collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is the asymmetric payoffs: rock vs paper has higher stakes (\u00b13 points) compared to other combinations (\u00b11 points). This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nStrategic Advisor: For the first move against a fresh player, we should consider that they might go with the most common or intuitive choice. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, 'rock' is often a popular first move choice due to its perceived \"strength.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, let's analyze the risks:\n- If we play paper: Win 1 vs scissors, Lose 3 vs rock\n- If we play rock: Win 3 vs paper, Lose 1 vs scissors\n- If we play scissors: Win 1 vs rock, Lose 1 vs paper\n\nGame Theorist: With no prior history, playing 'paper' is relatively risky due to the potential -3 penalty. 'Scissors' has the most balanced risk profile with only \u00b11 point outcomes.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree. For an opening move, scissors provides the best risk-adjusted outcome. It limits our potential loss while maintaining the opportunity for a win.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on this analysis, I'll choose scissors for the first move. It offers a balanced risk profile while protecting against the potential high loss from playing paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This could indicate several things:\n1. They might have anticipated our scissors play\n2. They might have a preference for paper\n3. Or it could be a random choice\n\nStrategic Advisor: Players often stick to winning moves, so there's a chance they might play paper again. However, sophisticated players might anticipate that we'll adjust to their previous move and change their strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n- If they play paper again: we should play rock (win 3)\n- If they expect us to play rock and switch to scissors: we lose 1\n- If they switch to rock thinking we'll play paper: we lose 3\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they won with paper, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\na) Stick with the winning move\nb) Anticipate their opponent's adjustment and counter it\n\nStrategic Advisor: In this case, playing rock offers the highest potential payoff (3 points) if they stick with paper, and only risks a small loss (-1) if they switch to scissors. It's a calculated aggressive move.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the rock play. The potential upside (3 points) outweighs the potential downside (-1 if they switch to scissors), and it directly counters their previous winning move.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense.

The sequence so far has been:\nRound 1: They played paper (won)\nRound 2: They played rock (tie)\nThis suggests they're not following a simple pattern and are thinking strategically.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The tie with rock shows they might be anticipating our moves. After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by predicting their opponent's next move. Since we both played rock, they might expect us to switch to paper to beat rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n1. If we play paper and they anticipate it with scissors: we lose 1\n2. If we play scissors and they stay with rock: we lose 1\n3. If we play rock again and they switch to paper: we lose 3\n4.

This could lead them to play scissors to counter.\n\nStrategic Advisor: However, more basic strategy suggests that after a tie, players often stick with their previous move, hoping their opponent will try to counter it, allowing them to counter the counter.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the high stakes of paper vs rock (\u00b13), and the fact that they've shown strategic thinking, playing scissors might be our safest bet. It limits our potential loss while still giving us a winning opportunity.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with playing scissors. It protects us from the obvious paper play while only risking a -1 if they stick with rock.

The fact that they followed the sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors might not be coincidental.

This could lead them to play scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the complex mind game at this point, we should consider a play that protects us from the worst-case scenario while maintaining winning potential.

This could be a pattern: they seem to favor rock as an aggressive move, especially after scissors plays.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our opponent has played rock three times now, more than any other move. This suggests a potential preference for rock, possibly because of its higher scoring potential (+3 when it wins).\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might be frustrated after losing their first round. Players often respond to losses in one of two ways:\n1. Make an aggressive play to recover points\n2.

The opponent seems to be playing more conservatively lately, perhaps protecting their lead.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the overall game:\n- We're still at -3 points total\n- We've had 6 ties, suggesting both players are often thinking similarly\n- Most of our losses have come when we've tried to be too clever\n- Our one win came with scissors\n\nGame Theorist: After consecutive paper plays, there might be a natural tendency to switch to scissors. However, this opponent has consistently shown they can anticipate and counter our logical moves.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our most successful moves have been when we've played straightforwardly rather than trying to outthink the opponent. Scissors has been our most successful move - it got us our only win and has resulted in several safe ties.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the immediate options after a paper-paper tie:\n1. Scissors - The obvious counter, but might be expected\n2. Rock - Risky with a potential -3 loss\n3. Paper - Third time might be predictable\n\nGame Theorist: Given that overthinking has hurt us, and scissors has been our most reliable move, perhaps we should simply go with scissors - not because it's the counter to paper, but because it's been our most effective play.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree. Let's play scissors. While it might seem obvious as a counter to paper, it's also been our most successful move in this game. Sometimes the straightforward play is the right one, and we've seen that trying to be too clever has often backfired.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We've won with scissors against rock twice now, both in Round 6 and Round 10. The opponent seems to return to rock at key moments, perhaps expecting us to make more complex plays.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our total score is now -2 points. Our simpler approach is working better - our last two scissors plays have both won, suggesting that playing straightforwardly is more effective than trying to outsmart the opponent.\n\nGame Theorist: There's a clear pattern emerging: when we've played scissors without overthinking, we've had success. When we've tried to be too strategic or clever, we've often lost.\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent might now:\n1. Avoid rock after just losing to scissors twice\n2. Expect us to ride our success with scissors and counter with paper\n3. Play scissors themselves to force a tie\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our recent success with scissors, there's a strong temptation to play it again. However:\n1. Paper is the safest against their likely counters to scissors\n2. Rock could win big but risks a big loss\n3. Scissors would be our third aggressive scissors play\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has consistently shown they can adapt to patterns. Playing scissors a third time might be pushing our luck, especially after two successful scissors plays.\n\nAI Assistant: Let's maintain our simpler approach but acknowledge that even the opponent might expect a third scissors play. Paper seems like the balanced choice here:\n1. It protects against the likely rock counter to our scissors streak\n2. If they play scissors expecting us to play paper as a safe move, we only lose 1 point\n3. It continues our strategy of straightforward, non-overthinking plays\n4. It has the potential for a big win if they do play rock\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, this opponent has shown they can punish predictable pattern breaks.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our options after another paper tie:\n1.

When we've played scissors based on simple, straightforward reasoning, we've had our best results.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree. Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. It's been our most successful move throughout the game\n2. When we've played it without overthinking, it's worked well\n3. After multiple paper ties, a change is reasonable\n4.

Rock: Could win big against paper but risks big loss\n2. Paper: Could lead to another tie sequence\n3.

However, the opponent has consistently punished our aggressive moves when we've been too predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, paper might be our best play. Here's why:\n1. It's safe against rock (would win 3)\n2. Only risks losing 1 to scissors\n3. Could result in a tie, which has been common\n4. The opponent might expect us to avoid paper after so many recent paper plays\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with playing paper. This decision is based on:\n1. We need to avoid another big loss\n2.

They tried to break their losing streak with a paper play\n2. It resulted in their biggest possible loss\n3. They might be questioning every strategic decision\n4. Their confidence is likely severely impacted\n\nGame Theorist: After losing to rock when playing paper:\n1. Players typically avoid repeating the losing move (paper)\n2. There's often a tendency to play scissors to counter potential rock repeat\n3. Some might play rock as a \"reset\" move\n4. The psychological impact of a -3 loss often leads to more conservative play\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our options:\n1. Rock - Just won big but highly unlikely to work again\n2. Paper - Could win against rock but risky\n3. Scissors - Safest play against likely responses\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our consistent success has come from:\n1. Reading opponent's psychological state\n2. Making logical but non-obvious moves\n3. Staying ahead of their adjustments\n4. Managing risk while maintaining aggressive potential\n\nAI Assistant: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. After losing big with paper, the opponent is likely to:\n   - Avoid paper (recency bias)\n   - Expect us to play rock again after its success\n   - Play scissors to counter our potential rock repeat\n   - Or play rock as a \"safe\" reset move\n2. Scissors gives us:\n   - Win against paper if they try to be clever\n   - Win against rock if they play conservatively\n   - At worst a tie with scissors\n3. With a +7 lead, we can focus on safe plays that maintain winning potential\n4. It continues our strategy of logical, forward-thinking moves while protecting our substantial lead\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Traditional logic suggests rock as the counter\n2. However, this opponent has shown they can match our thinking\n3. They've started to break free from their losing spiral\n4. The psychological dynamic might be shifting\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie with scissors:\n1. Both players know rock is the \"obvious\" counter\n2. This creates a mind game where:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors ties scissors\n3. The opponent has shown they can match our level of thinking\n\nRisk Analyst: Analyzing our options:\n1. Rock - Traditional counter but might be too obvious\n2. Paper - Beats rock if they make the obvious play\n3. Scissors - Third scissors would be unusual but safe\n\nStrategic Advisor: Our success has come from:\n1. Making non-obvious but logical moves\n2. Reading the opponent's psychological state\n3. Staying one step ahead in the thinking chain\n4. Taking calculated risks when appropriate\n\nAI Assistant: Let's play paper. Here's why:\n1. After a scissors tie, most players consider these thoughts:\n   - \"I should play rock to beat scissors\"\n   - \"They expect me to play rock, so they'll play paper\"\n   - \"They think I'll play paper to beat their rock, so they'll play scissors\"\n2. The opponent has shown they can match our thinking level (with the scissors tie)\n3. They're likely to play rock because:\n   - It's the basic counter to scissors\n   - They need to make up points and might go for the straightforward play\n   - They might think we'll overthink and play scissors again\n4. Paper gives us:\n   - Win against the most likely rock play\n   - Only risks -1 against scissors\n   - Continues our strategy of logical but non-obvious moves\n5.

They've adapted to our level of strategic thinking\n2. They might have found a pattern in our decisions\n3. They're playing more confidently now\n4. They're making stronger reads of our moves\n\nGame Theorist: After losing big to rock:\n1. There's pressure not to repeat paper\n2. The opponent might expect us to play scissors to counter their rock\n3. They might stick with rock after its success\n4. Or they might expect us to overthink and play something unexpected\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our options:\n1. Scissors - Direct counter to their successful rock\n2. Paper - Would be unusual after a big loss\n3. Rock - Safe against scissors, but vulnerable to paper\n\nStrategic Advisor: We need to:\n1. Stop the opponent's momentum\n2. Protect our remaining lead\n3. Avoid being too predictable\n4. Make a play that maintains winning potential\n\nAI Assistant: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. After a successful rock play, the opponent is likely to either:\n   - Stick with rock (players often repeat successful moves)\n   - Play paper expecting us to play rock defensively\n   - Not expect us to play the direct counter to their previous move\n2. Scissors gives us:\n   - Direct counter if they repeat rock\n   - Safe tie if they predict this and play scissors\n   - Only risks -1 if they outthink us with paper\n3. We need to play more directly and avoid overthinking\n4. With a +4 lead, we can afford a small loss but should avoid another big one\n5.
