Opponent assessment:\n   - After losing with rock, they might:\n     a) Switch to paper expecting repeated scissors\n     b) Stay with rock hoping I'll get aggressive\n     c) Try scissors as safe middle ground\n   - They've often countered my complex plays successfully\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - Keep strategy simple after success\n   - Avoid temptation to get aggressive for bigger points\n   - Paper is too risky (-3 losses)\n   - Scissors worked but obvious to repeat\n   - Rock offers balanced risk/reward\n   - Rock beats scissors if they try that safe play\n\n[move] rock Maintaining simple strategy while covering likely scissors response\n",
