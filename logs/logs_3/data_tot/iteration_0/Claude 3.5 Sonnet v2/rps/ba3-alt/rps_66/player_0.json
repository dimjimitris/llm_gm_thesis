    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the point values:\n- Rock vs Paper: +3/-3 points\n- Paper vs Scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Scissors vs Rock: +1/-1 points\nThe highest potential gain is +3 with rock beating paper, but it also has the highest potential loss.\n\nRisk Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any pattern to analyze yet. We should consider that rock is high-risk/high-reward, while scissors and paper have lower risk/reward ratios.\n\nPattern Analyzer: With no prior moves to analyze, we should start with a relatively balanced approach. Paper might be a good first move since it can win big (+3) but loses small (-1).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Paper as the opening move. It balances potential gains and losses well - if we win with paper against rock, we get +3, and if we lose to scissors, we only lose -1.\n\nRisk Analyst: Concurring with paper as the first move. It's a good risk-management choice for an opening move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh opponent, paper provides a balanced risk-reward profile with potential for high gain (+3) while limiting potential losses (-1).\n"

Paper might be their default opening move\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, we need to consider what a rational opponent might do next. They might:\n1. Switch to scissors to beat our paper if they think we'll stick with it\n2. Stay with paper expecting us to change\n3. Switch to rock trying to get the higher reward\n\nRisk Analyst: If we assume they're likely to switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play, we should consider switching to rock. This would:\n- Beat their scissors (+1 points)\n- Only lose to their paper (-3 points)\n- Tie if they also choose rock (0 points)\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the rock suggestion. It's a good counter to the most likely opponent move (scissors), and even though it risks a bigger loss to paper, the opponent might be less likely to stick with paper after a tie.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological aspect suggests that after a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move. Rock would be a strong counter to this expected behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the previous tie with paper, our opponent may switch to scissors expecting us to stay with paper.

They're using very similar strategic reasoning\n3. It's coincidental but highly noteworthy\n\nGame Strategist: The fact that they've matched us twice creates an interesting dynamic. If they are indeed following our moves, they would need to be predicting them. Our previous progression has been paper \u2192 rock, which might lead them to expect scissors as the next logical move in the cycle.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at our options:\n1.

Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: If they're trying to predict our next move, they might expect scissors to complete the paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors cycle. In that case, we should break the pattern. Paper would be a bold move here, as it would:\n- Win big if they choose rock again (+3)\n- Only lose small if they choose scissors (-1)\n- Tie if they also break pattern with paper (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with breaking the expected pattern. The opponent has shown they either think like us or are following us. Let's use this to our advantage by avoiding the obvious scissors choice.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper does offer the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.

Let's analyze what happened:\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nRound 3: We played paper, they played rock (we lost -3)\nThey broke their pattern of mirroring us and caught us with a high-impact move.\n\nGame Strategist: This suggests our opponent is more sophisticated than initially thought. They may have been building up the mirroring pattern to lull us into a false sense of predictability, then capitalized with a high-scoring move.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -3 points, which means we need to be more aggressive in trying to recover points. However, we need to be careful not to fall into another trap. After their successful rock play, they might:\n1. Stay with rock after its success\n2. Switch to paper anticipating our scissors\n3. Switch to scissors to counter paper\n\nGame Strategist: Given they just scored a big win with rock, psychology suggests they might stick with it. Players often repeat successful moves, especially high-scoring ones.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Their previous behavior shows strategic thinking - first mirroring, then breaking pattern for maximum points. This suggests they're not playing randomly but rather setting up and executing planned strategies.\n\nRisk Analyst: In this case, scissors would be our best move:\n- If they stick with rock (likely), we win +1\n- If they switch to paper, we win +1\n- We only lose -1 if they predict this and play rock\nThe risk-reward ratio is favorable, and we need to start recovering points.\n\nGame Strategist: Scissors also serves another purpose - it shows we're not easily rattled by their successful play and can adapt our strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Their last move (rock) scored them a big win, and players often stick with successful moves.

Stick with rock - hoping we overthink and change our winning move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their play style suggests they're good at reading and manipulating expectations. The fact that they kept rock even after we broke their mirroring pattern shows confidence in their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we just won with scissors, they're likely to expect us to either:\n1.

Three rocks in a row after showing strategic sophistication earlier seems suspicious.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Remember how they used mirroring early on to set up a trap? This could be a similar setup - letting us win small (+1) twice to tempt us into continuing with scissors, before switching to paper for a big win (-3).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. This feels like a trap. Their earlier play showed they're capable of sophisticated strategy. No sophisticated player would continue losing with rock unless it's part of a larger plan.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider our options:\n1. Stick with scissors: Very risky as they're likely to switch to paper\n2. Switch to rock: Safe against paper, but loses big to potential paper\n3.

Matching/mirroring mode (when we make certain moves)\n2. Stubborn mode (when we played scissors)\nWe need to use this insight to our advantage.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The fact that they matched our rock instead of switching to paper (as we predicted) suggests they might be using our moves as triggers for their strategy.

Our opponent is employing what's known as a \"commitment strategy\" - they've committed to rock regardless of outcomes. This strategy:\n1. Exploits opponent psychology (tempting paper plays)\n2. Accepts small losses to scissors\n3. Waits for big wins when opponents deviate from scissors\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the last few rounds:\n- We've won 4 times with scissors (+4 points)\n- We've lost 2 times with paper (-6 points)\n- We've tied 3 times (0 points)\nIf we had stuck with scissors after our first win, we'd be ahead instead of at -2.\n\nPattern Analyzer: There's no complex pattern to analyze anymore. They've demonstrated an unwavering commitment to rock. The only time they didn't play rock was in round 1, which may have been to create an initial impression of variability.\n\nGame Strategist: We should maintain our pure scissors strategy. It's the rational response to their pure rock strategy. Any deviation would be falling into their trap again.\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors remains our only logical choice:\n1. Almost guaranteed +1 based on their history\n2. No downside risk\n3. Steady path to recovering our negative points\n\nPattern Analyzer: Even if they finally switch strategies, scissors still can't lose us points - it either wins or ties against both rock and paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Continuing our counter-strategy of scissors against their demonstrated rock commitment.

They've demonstrated incredible patience, playing rock 8 times, then finally switching to paper when we became fully committed to scissors. This shows extremely sophisticated long-term strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their possible thinking:\n1. They used rock to condition us to expect rock\n2. They accepted small losses until we were convinced\n3. They switched when we showed complete commitment to scissors\n4. They might now try to create uncertainty about their next move\n\nPattern Analyzer: This could be another multi-round setup. Options for their next move:\n1. Return to rock (trying to make us doubt scissors again)\n2. Stay with paper (expecting us to stick with scissors)\n3. Switch to scissors (expecting us to switch to rock)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated strategic sophistication, they likely know we're analyzing this heavily. They might expect us to:\n1. Keep scissors (thinking they'll return to rock)\n2. Switch to rock (to beat their paper)\n3. Switch to paper (to beat potential scissors)\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock seems our best move here because:\n1. Beats scissors if they try to punish a paper play\n2. Only loses small (-1) to rock if they return to it\n3. Loses big to paper, but they rarely repeat moves (-3)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

Paper against their rock-heavy strategy gives us the best chance for a significant gain (+3).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at the real pattern (not our misinterpretations), they've played rock in probably 80% or more of rounds. We should play to this overwhelming tendency.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper We need to stop misinterpreting their moves and play against their clear rock preference.

Round 1: Mirrored paper (tie)\n2. Round 17: Mirrored paper (tie)\n3. Round 19: Mirrored paper (tie)\nThey consistently mirror our paper plays.\n\nRisk Analyst: However, their \"mirror paper\" response creates an opportunity. If they're consistent in mirroring paper, scissors would win against their paper (+1).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at post-paper-mirror situations:\n- After Round 1: They stayed in mirror mode (rock)\n- After Round 17: They went back to rock\n- Now: Historical pattern suggests they either continue mirroring or return to rock\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial decision point. While scissors would beat their paper if they mirror, it loses to their rock if they return to their base strategy. Given their strong preference for rock overall, we should consider paper again.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Scissors: Wins vs paper (+1), loses vs rock (-1)\n2. Paper: Wins vs rock (+3), loses vs scissors (-1)\n3. Rock: Wins vs scissors (+1), loses vs paper (-3)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their tendency to mirror paper has been consistent lately, but their long-term preference for rock has been their most successful strategy. They know we might try scissors to beat their paper mirror.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest sticking with paper:\n1. If they mirror again: Tie (0)\n2. If they return to rock: Big win (+3)\n3. If they try scissors: Small loss (-1)\nThe risk-reward ratio favors paper, especially given our -5 position.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper While they've been mirroring our paper plays, switching to scissors is risky given their strong historical preference for rock.

Their rock strategy has been dormant during this paper-mirroring phase\n3. The obvious counter to paper-mirroring would be scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at similar patterns:\n- Early game: They mixed between mirroring and rock\n- Mid game: Heavy rock commitment\n- Late game: Strong paper-mirroring commitment\nThey seem to be shifting strategies over time.\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly recommend scissors now:\n1.

It's our only move that hasn't been punished recently\n2. It maintains pressure on them to either keep mirroring or make a move\n3.
