    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Analyst - For understanding opponent psychology\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. The asymmetric points are interesting:\n- Rock vs Paper: 3/-3 points (high stakes)\n- Paper vs Scissors: 1/-1 points (low stakes)\n- Scissors vs Rock: 1/-1 points (low stakes)\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Since this is a fresh opponent and the first move, they might either go with:\na) Rock (most common first move psychologically)\nb) Random choice due to lack of pattern\n\nRisk Manager: Given the payoff structure, we should consider that:\n1. Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (\u00b13 points)\n2. Other combinations have lower stakes (\u00b11 point)\n3. For a first move, we should balance potential gain vs loss\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest playing Paper because:\n1. If opponent plays Rock (common first move), we get +3\n2. If opponent plays Paper, we tie (0)\n3. If opponent plays Scissors, we only lose 1 point\nThis maximizes our upside while limiting our downside.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree. Paper is psychologically sound as a first move, especially against a fresh opponent who might default to Rock.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for Paper looks optimal. Maximum potential gain of 3, maximum potential loss of 1.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they think we'll repeat paper, they might switch to scissors\n2. If they're strategic, they might expect us to switch to rock (to counter their expected scissors)\n3. There's also the possibility they'll stick with paper, thinking we might switch\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at possible outcomes:\n- If we play scissors and they stick with paper: +1\n- If we play scissors and they switch to rock: -1\n- If we play scissors and they switch to scissors: 0\nThe risk-reward ratio for scissors is balanced.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors because:\n1. It beats paper if they repeat\n2. If they switch to rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. Even if they predict this and play scissors, we only tie\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree with scissors. Psychology suggests opponents often stick with their previous move after a tie, especially if they were using a thoughtful strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: The maximum downside is only -1, which is acceptable given the potential upside of catching them with paper again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Second round: both scissors\nThis suggests either:\n- They're following our moves somehow\n- They're using very similar strategic thinking\n- Or it could be a coincidence, but two matches in a row is noteworthy\n\nGame Strategist: This pattern is crucial. If they're following our moves:\n1. They might be one step ahead in thinking\n2. We need to break this mirroring pattern\n3. They've demonstrated strategic sophistication\n\nRisk Manager: Let's assess our options:\n1. Rock would:\n   - Beat their scissors if they repeat (+1)\n   - Lose to paper if they predict us (-3)\n   - Tie if they also choose rock (0)\n2. Paper would:\n   - Beat rock (+3)\n   - Lose to scissors (-1)\n3. Scissors would:\n   - Continue the pattern we want to break\n\nGame Strategist: Given the mirroring pattern, I suggest rock because:\n1. It's a natural progression in the typical rock-paper-scissors cycle\n2. It beats scissors if they're stuck in repetition\n3. If they predict rock and play paper, yes we lose 3, but we need to break this pattern\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I disagree. The opponent has shown they think similarly to us. They might also conclude rock is the natural next move. I suggest paper to counter their likely rock play.\n\nRisk Manager: I side with the Behavioral Analyst. Paper offers better risk-reward:\n- Maximum loss of 1 point vs scissors\n- Maximum gain of 3 points vs rock\n- Safer than rock which risks losing 3 points\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

They lost this round, which might influence their next decision\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze what this tells us:\n1. They may have been trying to predict based on our last move\n2. Their strategy seems to be more reactive than strategic\n3. After losing, players often switch strategies\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation assessment:\n1. We're ahead by 1 point\n2.

Might try to \"reset\" with a basic move like rock\n\nGame Strategist: If they're using \"beat the previous move\" strategy:\n- We played paper, so they might play scissors\n- To counter that, we should play rock\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with playing rock because:\n1. It beats scissors if they continue their pattern\n2. If they play paper, we lose 3 but we're still ahead by playing conservatively so far\n3. Rock is also good if they \"reset\" to classic first-move rock\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I concur.

We need to:\n1. Be aware they might continue their scissors preference\n2. Consider that they might finally switch after showing such scissors bias\n3. Balance our risk given the current tie situation\n\nGame Strategist: Given their heavy scissors play, they likely will:\n1. Either continue with scissors believing it's working\n2. Or make a major strategy shift expecting us to counter scissors\n\nBehavioral Analyst: Psychology suggests that after multiple successful scissors plays:\n1. They might have developed a comfort with scissors\n2. But they must know we're now very aware of their scissors tendency\n3. This might be the perfect time for them to switch\n\nRisk Manager: I recommend rock because:\n1. If they stick with scissors (shown preference), we win\n2. If they switch to paper (trying to be clever), we lose but it's an acceptable risk\n3.

The maximum loss of 1 point is acceptable given our need to catch up, and it could give us the lead back if they play paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The tie might make them think we're back to mirroring\n\nRisk Manager: Critical situation:\n1. We need at least 1 point to tie, 2 to win\n2. Can't afford to play too safe\n3. But a -3 loss would be devastating\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie, especially with scissors, players often:\n1. Switch to rock thinking opponent will repeat scissors\n2. Or play paper to counter the expected rock\n3. Less likely to repeat scissors a third time\n\nBehavioral Analyst: This feels like a pivotal moment:\n1. They might expect us to play rock to counter potential scissors\n2. Which could lead them to play paper\n3. Their early scissors preference might influence their thinking\n\nRisk Manager: Given we need to score, I recommend paper because:\n1. If they play rock (countering our previous scissors), we win big (+3)\n2. If they repeat scissors, we lose small (-1)\n3. If they play paper, we tie\n4. We need the higher scoring potential to overcome our deficit\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Paper gives us the best chance to win the game outright while keeping our potential loss manageable.

They might stick with Rock as it's psychologically \"safe\"\n2. They've shown ability to make unexpected moves\n3.
