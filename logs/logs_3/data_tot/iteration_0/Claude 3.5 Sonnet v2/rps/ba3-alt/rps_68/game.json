Recent pattern analysis:\n- Round 10: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 11: My paper vs their scissors (won +1)\n- Round 12: My rock vs their scissors (lost -1)\n- Round 13: My rock vs their scissors (lost -1)\n- They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row\n\n2. Critical insights:\n- I've lost two rounds in a row playing rock against scissors\n- This defies normal game logic (rock should beat scissors)\n- Either there's a scoring rule I misunderstood, or\n- The game results were reported inversely from what I expected\n\n3. Game rule verification:\n- Looking back at original rules:\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n- I now realize scissors BEATS rock, not the other way around\n- This explains my recent losses\n- This is crucial information I misinterpreted earlier\n\n4. Strategic adjustment:\n- Need to completely revise my strategy based on correct rule understanding\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper\n- Paper beats scissors, which they've shown strong preference for\n- Given their four consecutive scissors plays, they seem committed to this strategy\n- Even with my losses, they haven't changed tactics\n- Paper is the correct counter to scissors according to the actual rules\n- My previous misunderstanding of rules led to poor choices\n- This play follows the correct game logic rather than my previous flawed assumptions\n\n[move] paper\n"

Understanding the correct rules (crucial):\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n- I'm now confident in these rule relationships\n\n3. Opponent behavior analysis:\n- They played scissors consistently until I played paper\n- They then mirrored my paper play\n- This suggests they're either:\n  a) Actively reading and responding to my moves\n  b) Also realizing they needed to switch from scissors\n  c) Trying to establish a new pattern\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n- They might expect me to stick with paper after a tie\n- Or they might return to their preferred scissors strategy\n- If they're truly adapting, they might play rock to beat paper\n- The highest risk is staying with paper and facing rock (-3)\n\n5. Decision: I will choose scissors\n- If they stick with paper (repeat last move), I win (+1)\n- If they go back to scissors (their comfort move), we tie\n- If they play rock (aggressive counter), I lose small (-1)\n- This play protects against their most likely moves\n- The potential loss is limited (-1) compared to staying with paper (-3)\n- Maintains unpredictability while having good winning potential\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Pattern insights:\n- Opponent shows strong preference for scissors throughout game\n- Brief deviations from scissors (to paper) were temporary\n- They return to scissors even after losing with it\n- Their behavior suggests scissors is their \"comfort move\"\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n- Opponent seems to have a default scissors strategy\n- When they deviate, they tend to return to scissors\n- They might be playing somewhat automatically/habitually\n- Their consistent return to scissors suggests limited strategic adaptation\n\n4. Strategy consideration:\n- Given their strong scissors preference, paper is theoretically correct\n- However, they might expect this obvious counter\n- But their history suggests they don't adapt even when losing\n- Complex mind games might be less effective than straightforward counters\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper again\n- While it might seem predictable, there's strong justification:\n  * Their scissors preference is extremely consistent\n  * They just lost with scissors but have history of returning to it\n  * They've shown limited strategic adaptation\n  * The straightforward counter might be best\n- Even if they expect paper and switch to rock:\n  * The -3 loss is acceptable given their strong historical pattern\n  * They haven't shown tendency for this level of adaptation\n- Sometimes the obvious play is correct when opponent shows strong behavioral patterns\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock vs Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3, Loser (Rock) gets -3\n   - Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1, Loser (Paper) gets -1\n   - Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1, Loser (Scissors) gets -1\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3 points) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and Scissors both have lower risk/reward (-1/+1)\n   - Without knowing opponent's tendencies, might be better to start conservative\n\n4. Since this is the first move:\n   - I want to balance potential gain with risk\n   - Rock offers balanced risk/reward\n   - If opponent plays Paper, I lose 3\n   - If opponent plays Scissors, I win 1\n   - If opponent plays Rock, it's a tie (0)\n\n[move] rock (Starting with a balanced option that has moderate risk and potential reward)\n",

Strategy considerations:\n   * Rock is relatively safe: worst case lose 3 points (vs paper), can win 1 point (vs scissors)\n   * Paper can win big (3 points vs rock) but is vulnerable to scissors (-1 point)\n   * Scissors has balanced outcomes: can win 1 point (vs paper), lose 1 point (vs rock)\n\n4. For a first move without knowing opponent tendencies:\n   * Paper has highest potential gain (3 points)\n   * The loss from paper (-1 vs scissors) is less severe than rock's worst case (-3)\n   * Paper provides good risk/reward ratio\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as it offers the best potential upside while having manageable downside risk.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Statistical analysis:\n- Out of 5 rounds, opponent played:\n  * Scissors: 4 times (80%)\n  * Paper: 1 time (20%)\n  * Rock: 0 times (never)\n- This is far from random distribution\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n- Opponent shows extremely strong scissors bias\n- Even ties and losses haven't deterred them from scissors\n- This could be:\n  a) A very committed strategy to wear down opponent\n  b) Setting up for a sudden change to rock\n  c) A simple fixed strategy\n\n4. Game theory application:\n- If they're truly fixed on scissors, rock is best play (+1)\n- If they're setting up for rock, paper is best play (+3)\n- If they continue scissors, any change from scissors risks losing\n\n5. Decision: I will choose rock\n- After four consecutive scissors plays, the probability of another scissors is high\n- The reward (+1) for beating scissors with rock is worth the risk\n- If they finally switch to paper, yes I lose 3 points, but this risk seems worth taking\n- Breaking the scissors deadlock is necessary to progress in the game\n\n[move] rock\n",

Psychology evaluation:\n- They might finally feel forced to switch strategies\n- After so many scissors plays, a change seems almost certain\n- If they switch, rock would be their most logical choice as it:\n  a) Beats their previously favored scissors\n  b) Would counter if I play scissors again\n  c) Only risks small loss vs paper\n\n4. Strategic options:\n- Paper: Would beat rock if they switch (+3), but loses to scissors (-1)\n- Rock: Would tie rock if they switch (0), but loses to paper (-3)\n- Scissors: Would beat paper (+1), but lose to rock (-1)\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper\n- I believe they will finally abandon scissors strategy\n- Rock is their most likely switch\n- Paper beats rock for a high reward (+3)\n- Even if I'm wrong and they play scissors again, the loss is minimal (-1)\n- The potential high reward outweighs the small risk\n\n[move] paper\n",

Decision: I will choose paper\n- Rationale:\n  * Direct counter to their persistent scissors play\n  * They've shown extraordinary commitment to scissors\n  * The tie hasn't punished their scissors play enough to force change\n  * While obvious, sometimes the straightforward counter is correct\n  * Their pattern is so strong it outweighs mind-game considerations\n  * Three consecutive scissors plays from them is too strong to ignore\n  * Even if they finally switch to rock (-3), their behavioral pattern justifies this risk\n  * Playing against their demonstrated habits rather than trying to overthink\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent pattern analysis:\n- Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 21: My paper vs their scissors (won +1)\n- Round 22: My paper vs their scissors (won +1)\n- Round 23: Both scissors (tie)\n- They've now played scissors THREE times in a row\n\n2. Deeper pattern recognition:\n- Their scissors play continues despite varied results:\n  * Lost to paper twice\n  * Then got a tie with scissors\n- This mirrors their earlier behavior patterns\n- They seem to get locked into scissors regardless of outcomes\n- This is their most consistent behavioral trait throughout the game\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n- The tie might reinforce their scissors strategy\n- Getting any result better than a loss (tie) often strengthens their current pattern\n- They've shown they prefer sticking with scissors even after losses\n- The tie might make them less likely to change strategy\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1): Strong choice if they maintain pattern\n- Rock loses big to scissors (-1): Too risky given their pattern\n- Scissors ties scissors (0): Safe but doesn't capitalize on their predictability\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper\n- Rationale:\n  * Direct counter to their highly consistent scissors play\n  * Their three consecutive scissors plays strongly suggest continuation\n  * The tie result likely reinforced their scissors tendency\n  * While they might expect paper, their history shows they rarely adapt\n  * They've repeatedly shown preference for scissors even when countered\n  * The reward (+1) outweighs the risk of them finally switching\n  * Their behavioral patterns throughout the game support this choice\n  * Sometimes the obvious counter is correct against a predictable opponent\n\n[move] paper\n",

Psychological factors:\n- The tie broke their losing streak\n- They might feel validated in returning to scissors\n- Their comfort with scissors seems to override strategic thinking\n- They're showing very predictable behavior patterns\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\n- Their three consecutive scissors plays strongly suggest their mindset\n- The tie might encourage them to continue with scissors\n- However, they might finally realize they're too predictable\n- But their history suggests they rarely make this realization\n\n5. Decision: I will choose paper\n- Rationale:\n  * Direct counter to their persistent scissors strategy (+1)\n  * Their three consecutive scissors plays show strong commitment\n  * The recent tie might reinforce their scissors comfort zone\n  * While they could switch to rock (-3), their entire game history suggests otherwise\n  * Their demonstrated resistance to changing strategies is very strong\n  * The psychological comfort they show with scissors outweighs strategic considerations\n  * Sometimes the obvious counter is correct when opponent shows such strong patterns\n  * Their behavior throughout the game supports this seemingly risky choice\n\n[move] paper\n",
