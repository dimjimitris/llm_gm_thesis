    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We should consider expected values:\n- Rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n- Paper: +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper\n- Scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Given that this is our first move, we should be relatively conservative. Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) but a relatively small penalty (-1), making it an attractive risk-adjusted choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper has the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. The maximum loss is -1, while the potential gain is +3.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our analysis, paper seems to be the optimal first move, offering the best combination of potential reward and limited downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Make a completely different choice to be unpredictable\n\nStatistics Analyst: Let's analyze what we know:\n- Opponent has demonstrated willingness to use rock\n- They've seen us use paper\n- They earned +3 points while we're at -3\n\nRisk Manager: Given our current negative position, we need to balance recovery with risk management. If they stick with rock, scissors would be risky (-1 points). If they switch to paper expecting our rock, we'd lose again. If they go scissors expecting our paper, we'd lose again.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n1. If opponent sticks with rock, we only lose 1 point (better than -3)\n2. If opponent switches to paper expecting our rock, we win 1 point\n3. If opponent goes scissors, it's a tie\nThe worst case (-1) is better than our previous loss (-3)\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors. It limits our downside while giving us a chance to score points if they try to counter our expected move.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense.

Let's review the history:\nRound 1: We played paper, they played rock (we lost -3)\nRound 2: We played scissors, they played rock (we won +1)\nThey've shown a strong preference for rock so far!\n\nStatistics Analyst: The pattern is clear - they've played rock twice in a row. This could mean:\n1. They have a fixed strategy of always playing rock\n2. They're trying to establish a pattern to trick us\n3. They're not very sophisticated in their strategy\n\nRisk Manager: Our current total score is -2 points (-3+1).

If they switch to paper, it's a tie (neutral outcome)\nThe expected value is positive given their demonstrated preference for rock.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree.

I recommend scissors:\n1. They've shown extreme consistency with rock after rock-rock ties\n2. They haven't adapted well to our moves after rock-rock situations\n3.

Scissors provides balanced risk-reward while avoiding the -3 risk of paper\n\nRisk Manager: Agree with scissors. The maximum loss of -1 is acceptable given our large lead, and it gives us a chance to win +1 if they continue with paper.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is convincing. Scissors provides a good balance of potential gain while limiting our risk, which is appropriate given our substantial lead and their mixed strategy of mirroring and countering.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They're using rock to counter our scissors.\n\nStatistics Analyst: Important patterns:\n- They've played rock twice against our scissors (breaking mirror pattern)\n- Their last few moves: paper, rock, paper, rock\n- They seem to be alternating between rock and paper\n- They're trying to establish a new pattern\n\nRisk Manager: Strategic considerations:\n- We have an excellent lead at +12\n- They've used rock unsuccessfully twice against scissors\n- They might expect us to switch away from scissors\n- Their alternating pattern might continue (suggesting paper next)\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors again:\n1. They've played rock against scissors twice and lost both times\n2. If they follow their alternating pattern, they'll play paper (we win +1)\n3. If they play rock again, we lose only -1\n4. If they try scissors, we tie\n5. They might be getting frustrated and making predictable moves\n\nRisk Manager: Agree with scissors. Despite losing twice to scissors, they might stick with rock out of frustration. Even if they do, the -1 loss is acceptable given our +12 lead.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Scissors is a strong choice that could capitalize on their apparent paper-rock alternation, while limiting our potential losses. Their recent predictable behavior makes this a good strategic choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Our +11 lead gives us room for this aggressive play.\n\nAI Assistant: Agreed. Rock provides a strong counter to their potential scissors play (if they expect us to use paper), while our substantial lead allows us to accept the risk of a -3 loss if they stick with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"
