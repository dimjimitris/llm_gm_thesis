    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Tie with scissors vs scissors (0)\n\nOur opponent's last four moves:\n- Rock\n- Scissors\n- Rock\n- Scissors\n\nThey've shown an alternating pattern between rock and scissors in their last four moves. If they continue this pattern, they should play rock next. However, they've also demonstrated they can break patterns when we try to exploit them.\n\nGiven this recent rock-scissors alternation and our history of ties with scissors, they might:\n1. Follow the pattern and play rock\n2. Stay with scissors expecting another tie\n3. Switch to paper to mix things up\n\nI'll choose paper here. Here's why:\n- If they follow their pattern to rock, we win with highest payoff (+3)\n- If they stay with scissors, we only lose 1 point\n- If they switch to paper, we tie\n\n[move] paper Anticipating the rock-scissors pattern to continue with rock\n"
