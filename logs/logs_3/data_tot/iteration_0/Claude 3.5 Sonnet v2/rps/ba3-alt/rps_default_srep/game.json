You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

My opponent played rock last time and it worked well for them\n2. They might be inclined to stick with a winning move\n3. If they do play rock again, paper would be the optimal counter\n4. However, they might anticipate this and switch to scissors\n\nAfter weighing these possibilities, I'll play scissors. Here's my reasoning:\n- If they stick with rock (which seems likely given their success), I'll get +1\n- If they switch to paper (anticipating my paper counter), I'll get +1\n- Only if they switch to scissors would I lose, but just -1 points\n\n[move] scissors (Anticipating either continued rock play or a switch to paper)\n"
