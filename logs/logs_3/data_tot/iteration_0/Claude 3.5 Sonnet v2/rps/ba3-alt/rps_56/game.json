Psychological assessment:\n   - Three consecutive non-losing moves for opponent\n   - They've found stability with paper\n   - They might be:\n     - Comfortable with current strategy\n     - Ready to break the pattern\n     - Expecting me to break pattern first\n\n4. Game theory consideration:\n   - Multiple paper plays create pressure to change\n   - Both players know this tension exists\n   - First player to deviate risks being countered\n   - But maintaining paper becomes increasingly unlikely\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - After two paper ties, change is highly likely\n   - Opponent probably expects me to switch to scissors to break ties\n   - If they expect this, they might switch to rock\n   - Therefore, I should play paper again:\n     - Beats rock if they try to counter scissors (+3)\n     - Ties with paper if they stay (-0)\n     - Only loses small to scissors if they predict correctly (-1)\n   - The psychological pressure to change actually makes staying with paper the unexpected move\n\n[move] paper\n"

This continues my strategy of changing moves each round while trying to stay one step ahead\n\nThis move maintains a balanced risk profile (-1 if I lose) while potentially extending my winning streak. It's important not to get overconfident despite the recent successes, so I'm choosing a move with limited downside.\n",
        "Recent sequence:\nRound 16-20: (earlier history)\nRound 21: scissors vs rock (win)\nRound 22: paper vs scissors (win)\nRound 23: rock vs paper (win)\n\nI'm on a remarkable three-win streak now, and my seventh win overall! The opponent seems to be struggling to predict my moves. My strategy of focusing on their likely response based on immediate previous moves is working well.\n\n[move] scissors I'm choosing scissors because:\n1. After losing to rock with paper, opponents often stick with paper expecting another rock\n2. If they do stick with paper, I win 1 point\n3. If they play rock expecting me to play paper (to counter their previous paper), I only lose 1 point\n4. This maintains my unpredictable yet logical sequence of moves\n5. If they're trying to break their own losing streak, they might play more conservatively with paper\n\nThis move maintains a balanced risk (-1 if I lose) while capitalizing on typical player psychology after consecutive losses.\n"
