    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

If I win with rock, I get 1 point, and if I lose with rock, I lose 3 points. While the potential loss is higher, I'm choosing rock because if my opponent is thinking about maximizing their potential gain, they might choose paper hoping for the 3 points, in which case I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n[move] rock Opening with rock to test the waters\n"

Looking at their recent pattern, they've played scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors - showing some variability. They might:\n1. Stay with scissors after a win\n2. Switch to paper expecting me to play scissors to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to rock to counter expected paper\n\nI'll choose paper. Here's why:\n- If they switch to rock (which they've done before after winning with scissors), I win 3 points\n- If they stay with scissors, I only lose 1 point\n- If they switch to paper expecting me to play scissors, we tie\n- The potential gain (3 points) outweighs the potential loss (1 point)\n\n[move] paper Expecting either rock counter or continued scissors\n"
