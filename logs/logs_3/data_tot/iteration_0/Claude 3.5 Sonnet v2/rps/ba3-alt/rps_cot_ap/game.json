For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - Should avoid highest risk option (Paper) without knowing opponent's style\n   - Better to start with a more balanced option\n   - Rock provides defense against Scissors and only risks -1 against Paper\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychological evaluation:\n   - Opponent demonstrating:\n     * New adaptability after pattern breaks\n     * Commitment to shorter-term strategies\n     * Possible return to original scissors preference\n     * Less predictable than during streaks\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - After losing with scissors, they might:\n     * Maintain scissors again (showing new persistence)\n     * Switch to rock (to counter expected paper)\n     * Switch to paper (complete strategy shift)\n   - Most dangerous is rock counter to paper\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Rock provides optimal coverage:\n     * Beats likely scissors continuation\n     * Ties with rock if they counter\n     * Only risks -3 against unlikely paper\n     * We have strong points buffer (+10)\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as safe counter to potential scissors persistence while protecting against rock counter-play\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game history focus:\n   - Opponent's last 8 moves:\n     * 6 papers in a row\n     * Then scissors (won vs rock)\n     * Then scissors (lost vs paper)\n   - Current total: +10 points\n   - Two consecutive scissors plays after paper streak\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's behavior evolution:\n     * First showed 8-round rock streak\n     * Then 6-round paper streak\n     * Now showing scissors preference\n     * May be starting new streak pattern\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - Opponent tendencies:\n     * Strong commitment to streaks\n     * Maintains moves even after losses\n     * Just lost with scissors but might persist\n     * History suggests streak-based thinking\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue scissors: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper loses (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: Paper ties (0)\n   - With +10 points, can take calculated risks\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper is optimal because:\n     * Beats third scissors if streak forming\n     * They've shown preference for long streaks\n     * Recent loss hasn't deterred their scissors play\n     * We're far ahead and can risk aggressive play\n\n[move] paper Maintaining paper play expecting continued scissors streak based on opponent's demonstrated streak behavior\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game history focus:\n   - Last three moves from opponent:\n     * Paper streak ended\n     * Scissors (won against our rock)\n     * Scissors (lost to our paper)\n   - Current total: +10 points\n   - Opponent has switched to more varied play\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Previous long streaks have ended\n   - Two consecutive scissors plays now\n   - Opponent might be:\n     * Starting new scissors streak\n     * Playing more adaptively\n     * Testing our responses\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - Opponent showing new behavior:\n     * Breaking from pure streak strategy\n     * Maintained scissors despite losing\n     * Might be returning to original scissors preference\n     * Could be starting new pattern\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If they continue scissors streak: Paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper loses heavily (-3)\n   - If they switch to paper: Paper ties (0)\n   - We have strong points lead to take calculated risks\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Given two consecutive scissors plays\n   - Paper has just been successful\n   - Opponent has shown preference for streaks\n   - We can absorb a loss with our point buffer\n\n[move] paper Continuing with paper against emerging scissors streak, accepting risk due to points lead and opponent's streak tendency\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game history focus:\n   - 6-round paper streak ended with scissors\n   - Last round: They stayed scissors (lost to my paper)\n   - Current total: +10 points\n   - Their recent pattern shifts show more variety\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Previous long streaks (8 rock, 6 paper) ended\n   - Two consecutive scissors plays now\n   - Lost with scissors but maintained it\n   - Showing shorter pattern commitment\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - Opponent demonstrates:\n     * More flexible strategy now\n     * Willing to stick with move despite loss\n     * Might be transitioning to shorter patterns\n     * Could be returning to original scissors preference\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Against recent scissors trend:\n     * Paper wins again (+1)\n     * Risk of rock counter (-3)\n     * Risk of new paper switch (-1)\n   - We're significantly ahead (+10) but shouldn't be reckless\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - With strong point lead, prefer safer plays\n   - Rock provides:\n     * Beats scissors if they continue trend\n     * Only small loss vs paper (-3)\n     * Tie against rock\n     * Safest overall coverage\n\n[move] rock Playing rock as safe counter to emerging scissors pattern while protecting our strong lead\n"
