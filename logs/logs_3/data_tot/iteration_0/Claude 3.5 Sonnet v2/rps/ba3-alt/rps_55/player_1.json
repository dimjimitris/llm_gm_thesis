    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For developing gameplay tactics\n3. Data Analyst - For analyzing potential patterns and outcomes\n\nLet's collaborate!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors. The key difference is that rock vs paper has higher stakes (3 points) compared to other combinations (1 point). This creates an imbalance in the risk-reward structure.\n\nStrategic Planner: Against a fresh player with no history, we need a balanced strategy. However, given the higher payoff for rock vs paper, people might be tempted to play rock more frequently hoping for the higher reward.\n\nData Analyst: The asymmetric payoff structure is notable. While rock can win big (3 points), it can also lose big (-3 points). Paper has the highest risk (-3) but moderate reward (1). Scissors has the most balanced risk-reward profile (-1/+1).\n\nGame Theorist: For an opening move, I suggest paper. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays rock (trying to get the high reward), we win 1 point\n2. If opponent plays scissors, we lose 1 point\n3. If opponent plays paper, it's a tie\nThis minimizes our maximum possible loss while maintaining potential for gain.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Paper is a conservative yet strategic opening move. The maximum we can lose is 1 point (against scissors), while we can gain 1 point (against rock).\n\n[move] paper This opening move balances potential gains while limiting maximum losses, considering the asymmetric payoff structure of the game.\n"

This could indicate either a preference for high-stakes plays or a deliberately aggressive opening strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to consider two possibilities:\n1. The opponent might stick with rock after a successful play\n2. The opponent might anticipate us switching to rock (to counter their previous move) and switch to paper\n\nData Analyst: Given they won with a high-risk play, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\na) Stick with what worked (-3 points hurt us significantly)\nb) Expect us to adapt and counter their previous move\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, I suggest playing scissors. Here's the logic:\n1. If they stick with rock (which brought them success), we only lose 1 point\n2. If they switch to paper (anticipating our rock counter), we win 1 point\n3. If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Playing scissors provides a balanced approach. It protects us from another devastating -3 loss while giving us winning potential if they try to counter what they might expect from us.\n\nData Analyst: The scissors play also helps us gather more information about their strategy pattern while minimizing our risk.\n\n[move] scissors This move protects against another major loss while maintaining winning potential, especially if opponent tries to counter our expected response.\n"

They might be satisfied with their lead and play more conservatively now.\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, I recommend playing rock. Here's why:\n1. If they continue their pattern of changing moves, they might play paper (trying to counter our expected scissors play)\n2. If they go back to rock, it's a tie\n3. If they stick with scissors (after the tie), we win 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: I support this. Rock gives us a chance to win against scissors while protecting against another paper play from our first round.

Pure coincidence, though less likely with two consecutive matches\n\nGame Theorist: Given this analysis, I suggest playing paper. Here's why:\n1.

If they play scissors (anticipating our paper), we lose only 1 point\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Paper gives us a chance to win 3 points if they return to their successful rock play, while risking only 1 point against scissors. Breaking the tie pattern is crucial since we're behind.\n\nData Analyst: The two consecutive ties have reduced volatility in the game.

Extremely good at predicting our moves\n2. More likely: They're actively mirroring us to maintain their lead\nThe probability of three random ties is (1/3)\u00b3 = 1/27, making this almost certainly intentional.\n\nGame Theorist: Since mirroring seems to be their strategy, we need to break this pattern. I suggest scissors, but with a twist in our timing. We should submit our move slightly later in our allowed time window, making it harder for them to mirror.\n\nStrategic Planner: I disagree with waiting - that's not within our ethical gameplay options. However, I agree with scissors as the move. If they are mirroring, they'll likely continue their pattern of copying our previous move (paper), in which case we'll win.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent has shown remarkable consistency in matching our moves. Playing scissors now would give us a +1 point if they play paper (expecting another tie), while risking -1 if they predict this exact strategy.\n\n[move] scissors Breaking the mirroring pattern is crucial.

This is not random (probability would be (1/3)\u2074 = 1/81)\n2. The opponent has access to our moves before making theirs\n3. They're content to protect their lead through perfect mirroring\n\nGame Theorist: This changes everything. If they can see our moves, we're dealing with a very different game theory scenario. Traditional mixed strategies won't work because they have perfect information.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given they likely have information about our moves, we need to understand that any move we make will probably result in another tie. However, we still need to make a move.\n\nData Analyst: Since they're likely to mirror regardless of our choice, all moves are technically equivalent in expected outcome. However, we should choose the move that would give us the best outcome if they somehow fail to mirror just once.\n\nGame Theorist: In that case, paper is our best choice because:\n1.

Desperate rock plays\n  2. Paper mirrors\n  3. Now scissors mirrors\n- Their mirroring accuracy improving under pressure\n- Must be reaching final moves\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. With their renewed mirroring precision, they might be one move behind (scissors)\n2. If they try to mirror immediately, we get the big +3 win\n3. If they play paper, we only lose 1 point of our large lead\n4. It's the aggressive play they might not expect while defending\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Rock offers:\n- Potential to end game with big win\n- Exploits one-move-behind mirroring\n- Safe with our substantial lead\n- Forces them to make perfect read to gain points\n\nData Analyst: The opponent's return to precise mirroring suggests they're focusing on defense rather than making up points. Rock provides maximum pressure while risking little of our lead.\n\n[move] rock Taking aggressive action to potentially close out the game while maintaining safe position with our large lead.\n"

Here's why:\n1. Most conservative play with our huge lead\n2. Maximum loss is only -1 if they play rock\n3. Could win +1 if they play paper again\n4. Safe play to protect our nearly insurmountable lead\n\nStrategic Planner: Strongly agree. With a 9-point lead:\n- No need for aggressive plays\n- Should minimize potential losses\n- Force opponent to make perfect plays\n- Scissors offers best risk-reward balance\n\nData Analyst: Given our lead and opponent's recent performance, scissors provides the optimal defensive posture while maintaining winning opportunities.\n\n[move] scissors Playing conservatively to protect our substantial lead while maintaining moderate winning potential.\n"
