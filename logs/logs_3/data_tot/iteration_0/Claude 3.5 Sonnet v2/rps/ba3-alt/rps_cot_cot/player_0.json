    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent success pattern:\n   - Just won with Scissors against Rock (+1)\n   - Previous unconventional wins came from similar counter-intuitive plays\n   - The strategy of playing \"incorrect\" moves has worked multiple times\n   - Opponent seems to struggle against moves that defy game theory\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Opponent just lost to an \"incorrect\" move\n   - They might be frustrated by losing to Scissors vs Rock\n   - They might expect me to:\n     a) Feel confident and try another unconventional play\n     b) Return to \"correct\" strategic choices\n     c) Think they'll expect another unconventional play\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   After their Rock:\n   - They might stick with Rock expecting me to play \"correctly\"\n   - They might switch to Paper anticipating my Rock\n   - They might play Scissors thinking I'll try Paper\n   - They've shown they can adapt, but seem vulnerable to unconventional plays\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Continuing unconventional play has merit\n   - They might over-analyze my strategy\n   - Playing the \"correct\" move might actually be more unexpected now\n   - Rock would be the conventional choice\n   - Need to maintain the psychological advantage\n\n[move] Paper (Playing Paper as it maintains the strategy of psychological warfare while being simultaneously obvious and unexpected)\n"

Complete history analysis:\n   Round 1-22: (Previous history noted)\n   Round 23: Opponent - Paper (tie)\n   Recent sequence: Won with \"wrong\" move \u2192 tied with \"right\" move\n\n2. Tie pattern analysis:\n   Previous tie sequences:\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Rock (R9/10)\n   - Paper tie \u2192 Rock (R12/13)\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Paper (R14/15)\n   - Paper tie \u2192 Rock (R18/19)\n   - Scissors tie \u2192 Rock (R20/21)\n   - Now Paper tie...\n   Note: Rock has been their most common post-tie move\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They might notice I've recognized their post-tie Rock tendency\n   - They've shown ability to break their own patterns when detected\n   - The game is deep enough that multiple levels of mind games are in play\n   - Success has come from unconventional choices\n\n4. Current momentum:\n   - My \"incorrect\" plays have been most successful\n   - They seem to struggle most when I defy conventional strategy\n   - They might expect me to either:\n     a) Counter their expected Rock\n     b) Make another unconventional play\n     c) Try to counter their counter-strategy\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper would be risky against their post-tie Rock pattern\n   - Rock would be safe but predictable\n   - Scissors is the least expected move after a Paper tie\n   - Scissors also counters potential Paper if they break their pattern\n   - Time to maintain the strategy of unconventional plays\n\n[move] Scissors (Playing Scissors as an unexpected move that continues the successful strategy of unconventional plays while offering good coverage against potential moves)\n"
