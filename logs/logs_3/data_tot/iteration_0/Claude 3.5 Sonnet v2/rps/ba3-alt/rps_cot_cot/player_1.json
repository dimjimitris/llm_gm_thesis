    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the points system:\n   * Rock-Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3 points\n   * Paper-Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1 point\n   * Scissors-Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1 point\n\n3. Analyzing potential strategies:\n   * Rock offers medium risk (-1 if lose to scissors) with medium reward (1 if win against scissors)\n   * Paper has high risk (-3 if lose to rock) with high reward (3 if win against rock)\n   * Scissors has low risk (-1 if lose to paper) with low reward (1 if win against paper)\n\n4. Without any prior information about the opponent:\n   * Playing rock is a balanced choice\n   * It protects against scissors (most common first move in many RPS games)\n   * Has moderate risk/reward profile\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * For a first move, I'll choose rock as it offers a balanced risk-reward profile\n   * It's a common opening move that many players use\n   * The potential loss is limited to -1 points\n\n[move] rock\n"

Psychological analysis:\n   * They just succeeded with scissors\n   * Gaining confidence in their predictions\n   * Might expect me to play predictably after a loss\n   * Could be settling into a rhythm\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After winning with scissors, players often:\n     - Stick with successful move\n     - Or expect opponent to play rock and switch to paper\n   * Need to break their momentum\n   * Must avoid becoming predictable\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * I will play paper\n   * Reasoning:\n     - If they stick with successful scissors, we lose only 1 point\n     - If they play rock (expecting me to counter scissors), we win big (3 points)\n     - If they try paper, we tie\n     - This breaks the obvious response of playing rock against scissors\n     - It's an unexpected move after losing to scissors\n     - The potential reward (3 points) outweighs the risk (-1 point)\n     - With a decent point lead, can afford some calculated risks\n     - Might catch them off guard if they're getting confident\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Round 20: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   * Round 21: scissors vs rock (won, 1)\n   * Round 22: rock vs scissors (lost, -1)\n   * Round 23: paper vs paper (tie)\n   * Current net score: 6 points\n   * Pattern shows frequent ties recently\n\n2. Opponent's recent pattern:\n   * Their last three: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   * They've used all three moves in sequence\n   * Successfully matched my paper\n   * Showing strong adaptive ability\n\n3. Post-paper-tie psychology:\n   * After paper ties:\n     - Most players switch to scissors to beat expected paper\n     - Some switch to rock anticipating opponent's scissors\n   * Both players likely to switch from paper\n   * Complex mind games in play\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * If they follow common strategy, they'll play scissors\n   * If they think I'll expect scissors, they might play rock\n   * If they try to be clever, they might stick with paper\n   * Need to account for their good adaptive skills\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * I will play rock\n   * Reasoning:\n     - Counters the most likely move (scissors) after a paper tie\n     - If they play scissors (most common after paper tie), we win\n     - If they play paper again, we lose but only -3\n     - If they play rock, we tie\n     - Breaking the common pattern of switching to scissors after paper tie\n     - They've shown good prediction skills, so avoiding obvious scissors play\n     - With a solid point lead, can afford to make a strong defensive play\n     - Rock has been underutilized in recent rounds\n\n[move] rock\n"
