    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Data Analyst - For analyzing patterns and probabilities\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Looking at the points:\n- Paper vs Scissors: Winner(Scissors) +1, Loser(Paper) -1\n- Rock vs Paper: Winner(Rock) +3, Loser(Paper) -3\n- Scissors vs Rock: Winner(Scissors) +1, Loser(Rock) -1\nThe highest potential gain is +3 with Rock beating Paper, but it also has the highest potential loss -3.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might choose the most common/intuitive first move. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, Rock is often a popular first choice for many players as it represents strength and stability psychologically.\n\nData Analyst: Given that Rock is a common first move, we could choose Paper to counter it. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing 3 points if they choose Rock. Scissors would be safer in terms of point loss (-1 if wrong against Paper).\n\nGame Strategist: Given this is the first move and we want to balance potential gains and losses, I suggest choosing Rock. Here's why:\n1. If opponent chooses Paper (we lose): -3 points\n2. If opponent chooses Rock (tie): 0 points\n3. If opponent chooses Scissors (we win): +1 point\nWhile we risk -3 points, we also have a good chance of either a tie or small win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Given this is the first move, I'm choosing Rock as it provides a balanced risk-reward ratio and could counter a common Scissors opening move while protecting against potential mind games of expecting us to choose Paper against a predicted Rock.\n"

Now we need to consider their likely next move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by predicting they'll make a change. Common psychology suggests they might expect us to switch to Paper (to beat their previous Rock), so they might switch to Scissors to counter that prediction.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze the previous round and typical patterns:\n1. After ties, players tend to either:\n   - Stick to their move (less common)\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n   - Switch to what would have beaten what they think we'll play\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play Rock again. Here's the reasoning:\n1. If they expect us to switch to Paper and play Scissors \u2192 We win (+1)\n2. If they stick with Rock \u2192 We tie (0)\n3. If they switch to Paper \u2192 We lose (-3)\nThe opponent might overthink and assume we'll switch, making Scissors a likely choice for them. By sticking with Rock, we can potentially catch them making this assumption.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. Players often avoid repeating the same move three times, so even if we lose this round, we'll have good psychological insight for the next round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock After a tie with Rock, opponents often expect a switch to Paper and therefore play Scissors. By maintaining Rock, we can potentially catch this tactical shift while risking a paper counter-play.\n"

Become more cautious to avoid another big loss\n2. May feel frustrated and try to \"get back\" at us\n3. Might try to read our confidence from winning and counter what they think we'll do\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the sequence:\nRound 1: Rock (tie)\nRound 2: Rock (we won, they played Paper)\nThe opponent has shown they're willing to change strategies, but their prediction was incorrect last time.\n\nGame Strategist: After winning with Rock twice (one tie, one win), the opponent likely expects us to stick with our \"winning\" move. This makes Paper their most logical choice to finally beat our Rock. Therefore, I suggest we switch to Scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The psychology of \"third time's the charm\" might make them think we'll use Rock again, encouraging them to use Paper. Also, players rarely expect their opponent to switch strategies after a win.\n\nData Analyst: The risk/reward for Scissors is balanced:\n- If they play Paper: We win (+1)\n- If they play Rock: We lose (-1)\n- If they play Scissors: We tie (0)\nThis is a safer play than our previous moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors After winning with Rock, we expect the opponent to counter with Paper to beat our \"established pattern.\" Scissors provides a balanced risk-reward ratio while countering their likely adaptation.\n"

I apologize for the confusion - Scissors beats Paper (not the other way around), so our logic was correct but I stated the outcome wrong. Our total score is now +2 (+3 from previous win, -1 from this round).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has now stuck with Paper for two consecutive rounds, showing persistence despite it failing in the first attempt. This could indicate either:\n1. A stubborn strategy\n2. An attempt to establish a pattern to bait us\n3. They're trying to appear predictable to set up a trap\n\nData Analyst: Let's review the sequence:\nRound 1: Rock vs Rock (tie)\nRound 2: Rock vs Paper (we won +3)\nRound 3: Scissors vs Paper (we lost -1)\nPaper has been their choice for two rounds straight.\n\nGame Strategist: Given they've shown Paper twice, they're likely to switch now. The most logical choices for them would be:\n1. Rock - to beat the Scissors they expect us to play again\n2. Scissors - to completely switch things up\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing with Paper twice (once badly, once slightly), they're very likely to abandon that strategy.

The natural progression in many players' minds would be:\nScissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock (completing the cycle)\n\nData Analyst: If we analyze potential counters to this psychological progression:\n- If they play Rock (completing the cycle): Scissors would lose (-1), Paper would win (+3)\n- If they stay with Paper: Scissors would win (+1), Rock would lose (-3)\n- If they play Scissors: Rock would win (+1), Paper would lose (-1)\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Scissors for these reasons:\n1.

After losing with Rock, they're likely to switch to either:\n   - Paper (trying to beat our expected Rock) \u2192 We lose 3\n   - Scissors (their least used move) \u2192 We win 1\n2.

Avoid another -3 loss at all costs\n2. Look for opportunities for +3 gains\n3. At minimum, stay safe with potential for small gains\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After consecutive wins, especially a big point gain, players often:\n- Either stick with their winning move feeling invincible\n- Or switch expecting their opponent to counter their last successful move\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Scissors.

If they play Paper: We tie (0)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I disagree. After losing with Rock and seeing the Round 7-8 parallel, they'll expect us to play Paper thinking they'll repeat their Rock play. They're more likely to play Scissors to punish this expectation.\n\nGame Strategist: Good point. Then let's play Rock:\n1. If they play Scissors as predicted: We win (+1)\n2.
