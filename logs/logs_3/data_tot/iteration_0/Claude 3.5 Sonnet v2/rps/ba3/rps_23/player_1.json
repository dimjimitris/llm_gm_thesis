    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing recent sequence:\n   * Important progression:\n   * - Two ties (rock, scissors)\n   * - Won with scissors (+1)\n   * - Just tied with rock (0)\n   * Current total: -1 points\n   * Back to tie situation\n   * No momentum lost\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   * Rock-rock ties are critical junctures\n   * Earlier in game:\n   * - Similar tie situations occurred\n   * - Opponent showed skill in breaking ties\n   * - They often predicted post-tie moves well\n   * But now both players showing caution\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * After rock tie:\n   * - Paper is common response\n   * - But opponent knows this\n   * - They've countered obvious moves before\n   * - Both players likely analyzing patterns deeply\n\n4. Strategic depth:\n   * Three levels of thinking:\n   * - Basic: Play paper to beat rock\n   * - Counter: Play scissors to beat paper\n   * - Meta: Stay rock expecting scissors\n   * Need to choose correct level\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Stay rock because:\n   * - Most players expect paper after rock tie\n   * - Opponent has shown sophistication\n   * - They likely expect me to play paper\n   * - Will probably try scissors to counter\n   * - Rock beats their likely scissors\n   * - Safer play while still at negative points\n   * - Only loses to paper, which is highest risk play\n\n[move] rock Using higher-level strategy by maintaining rock against expected scissors counter\n"
