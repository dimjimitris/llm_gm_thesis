    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

We should consider that paper gives the highest potential reward (+3) but also risks the highest penalty (-3).\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that this is the first move:\n1. Rock is relatively safe with moderate risk/reward\n2. Paper has highest risk/reward\n3. Scissors has moderate risk/reward\nThe opponent has no prior information to base their decision on, so they might go for a basic strategy like rock (which is commonly chosen first by many players).\n\nGame Theorist: Given that rock is a common first move for many players, and considering the risk/reward ratio, I would recommend playing paper. While it carries more risk, the potential reward is higher, and there's a psychological tendency for players to choose rock on their first move.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with playing paper. The higher reward potential (+3) justifies the risk, especially given the tendency of players to choose rock first. Even if they choose scissors, our loss would only be -1.\n\nRisk Analyst: The worst-case scenario with paper (-1 against scissors) is acceptable compared to the potential gain (+3 against rock). I support this decision.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move and many players tend to choose rock initially, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio with a potential for high points (+3) while limiting potential losses (-1).\n"

Pattern Analyst (new persona to help analyze opponent's behavior)\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent chose paper in the first round, which is interesting as it differs from the common \"rock first\" pattern. This suggests they might be a strategic player who also anticipated a first-round rock play.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that both players used paper, we need to consider the opponent's likely reasoning for their next move:\n1. They might expect us to switch to scissors to counter their paper\n2. They might stick with paper hoping we'll switch to rock\n3. They might switch to rock anticipating our scissors\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper first. In this situation, I believe they're likely to expect us to counter their previous move with scissors. Therefore, they might switch to rock to counter our expected scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If we assume they'll switch to rock to counter our expected scissors, we should stick with paper. This would give us +3 points if correct, and only -1 if they actually choose scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent's first move suggests they're not playing randomly but rather thinking strategically. In such mind games, double-thinking (expecting them to expect our scissors) is often effective.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's assess the outcomes if we play paper again:\n- If opponent plays rock: +3 points\n- If opponent plays paper: 0 points\n- If opponent plays scissors: -1 points\nThe risk-reward ratio is still favorable for paper.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I agree with staying with paper. It's a strong psychological play because:\n1. Most players don't expect the same move twice\n2. It maintains our potential for high reward\n3. It limits our potential loss\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper While the opponent might expect us to switch to scissors, we'll maintain our paper strategy.

Given their history:\n1. They started strategic with paper\n2. They switched to rock (perhaps expecting our scissors)\n3. They've been punished heavily (-3) and will want to recover\n\nStrategic Advisor: This is a crucial moment. The opponent has taken a significant loss and likely views us as predictable after two paper plays. They are highly likely to play scissors this round to:\n1. Counter our apparent paper preference\n2. Try to recover some points\n3. Punish our predictability\n\nRisk Analyst: Using paper a third time would be extremely risky now. The opponent has strong incentive to play scissors. However, if we're too obvious in switching to rock, they might anticipate that and stay with paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that we've shown a paper pattern, the opponent is very likely expecting either:\n1. A third paper play (which they'll counter with scissors)\n2. A switch to rock (which they might counter by sticking with paper)\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, the opponent is most likely to play scissors to counter our paper pattern. The optimal counter to their expected scissors would be rock.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I strongly agree with playing rock. It's the perfect time to switch because:\n1. It breaks our pattern at the right moment\n2. It counters the most likely opponent move (scissors)\n3.

We've correctly anticipated their moves\n3. They're likely feeling pressure to win back points\n4. Their previous adaptations have been unsuccessful\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent is likely to notice that each of their strategy changes has been countered successfully.

If they play paper to counter our potential rock: Scissors wins (+1)\n3.

Or paradoxically, return to their most comfortable move (often rock)\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent is likely to abandon any systematic strategy at this point.

It counters the likely aggressive scissors play\n2. It protects against emotional, aggressive decision-making\n3. Even if they play paper, we've built up enough points to absorb a -3 loss\n4.

Seven consecutive wins\n2. 13-point differential\n3. We've perfectly countered every move\n4. The opponent has experienced complete strategic failure\n\nStrategic Advisor: At this point, the opponent is likely experiencing:\n1. Complete psychological defeat\n2. Decision-making paralysis\n3. Total loss of confidence\n4. Possible surrender mentality\n\nRisk Analyst: In such an extreme situation, players typically either:\n1. Make completely random moves out of desperation\n2. Become totally predictable due to mental exhaustion\n3. Try to at least avoid their last losing move (rock)\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent sequence shows diminishing returns to any strategic thinking. After their rock just lost heavily (-3), they're extremely unlikely to repeat it. Looking at their complete pattern, they might return to scissors - it's been two rounds since they last used it, and it feels \"aggressive\" which might appeal to their desperate state.\n\nGame Theorist: In states of complete defeat, players often choose scissors as a last \"aggressive\" attempt to salvage some dignity. It's a psychological choice - they want to feel like they're \"attacking\" rather than defending.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend rock because:\n1. It counters the likely \"desperate scissors\" play\n2. It's psychologically sound against a completely defeated opponent\n3. Our massive lead allows us to play conservatively\n4. Even if they play paper (-3), we maintain a huge lead\n\nRisk Analyst: With our 13-point lead:\n- We can afford any outcome\n- Conservative play with rock is sensible\n- Countering their likely scissors gives us another win\n- Even a -3 loss leaves us far ahead\n\nPattern Analyst: All psychological indicators point to scissors - it's their last \"untried\" recent option and provides the illusion of aggressive play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After their devastating loss with rock, the opponent is likely to make an aggressive scissors play out of desperation.

After scissors fails, players often default to paper as it feels like a \"safe\" middle ground between aggressive scissors and defensive rock.\n\nGame Theorist: In states of complete defeat with recent scissors failures, paper becomes psychologically attractive as it represents a \"fresh start\" away from the aggressive scissors that just failed twice.\n\nStrategic Advisor: I recommend scissors because:\n1.
