    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Strategic Planner - For developing game plans and adapting to opponent behavior\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, it's interesting that paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) against rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, paper also risks the highest loss (-3 points) if the opponent plays scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to base our decision on. In such cases, it's often good to start with a balanced approach.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper is a high-risk, high-reward move. For a first move against an unknown opponent, we might want to avoid such volatility. Rock offers decent protection since it can only lose 3 points (against paper) but can win 1 point (against scissors).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Without any prior information about the opponent's tendencies, rock provides a balanced risk-reward profile for an opening move.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with rock for this first move. It gives us protection against scissors while maintaining a reasonable position against other moves.\n\n[move] rock This is an opening move against a fresh opponent, choosing a balanced risk-reward option.\n"

This could indicate either a generally aggressive strategy or they might have anticipated our conservative opening with rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to consider whether the opponent will:\n1. Stick with a winning strategy (paper again)\n2. Anticipate our adjustment and switch to rock\n3. Try to protect against our likely scissors counter by playing scissors themselves\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent used a high-risk, high-reward strategy and it paid off. They might be emboldened by this success. However, if they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to counter with scissors now.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that the opponent showed willingness to use the high-risk paper strategy, we should consider that they might be an aggressive player. In this case, they might stick to their winning strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The natural counter to someone who just played paper would be scissors. However, if they anticipate this, they might switch to rock to counter our scissors. But given it's only the second round and they just had success, there's a decent chance they might stick with paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with going for scissors here. Even if they switch to rock (which would be a sophisticated play), we only risk losing 1 point, while if they stick to paper (which seems psychologically likely after a win), we gain 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors The opponent showed aggressive play with paper last round.

However, given their demonstrated ability to think ahead, they might switch to scissors anticipating this. \n\nStrategic Planner: We need to break this pattern of them successfully predicting our moves. Since they've shown sophisticated play, they're likely expecting us to play paper to counter their rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: A rock play here would be interesting - if they go for scissors expecting our paper, we win. If they try to counter our potential rock with paper, they win. But given their pattern of successful predictions, they might expect us to make this exact analysis.\n\nGame Theorist: In game theory, when dealing with a sophisticated opponent, sometimes the best move is to be unpredictable. Rock has been played twice in the game (once by each player), paper and scissors once each.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with paper here. While they might expect it, it has the highest potential reward, and we need to make up for our point deficit. If they overthink and play scissors expecting our rock, we lose minimally (-1).\n\n[move] paper We need to make up our point deficit, and this move offers the highest reward potential.

We need to consider that they might abandon their cycle after losing.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that scissors just worked for us, they might expect us to stick with it, in which case they'd play rock. If they're following their cycle, they'll play rock anyway. Both scenarios point to them playing rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Since rock seems likely from their perspective (either following pattern or countering our potential scissors), paper would be our optimal play.

We're dealing with an opponent who's consistently outplaying us across all dimensions:\n- Pattern play\n- Counter-play\n- Strategic adaptation\n- Risk management\n\nStrategic Planner: In such situations, when an opponent is demonstrating superior strategic capability, sometimes the best approach is to introduce true randomness. They've shown they can beat both our intuitive and our calculated plays.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. When facing a superior opponent who can out-think our strategies, game theory suggests that playing randomly might be our best option. This makes us unpredictable and gives us a 1/3 chance of winning regardless of their strategy.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's use a truly random choice among the three options, without trying to outthink our opponent.
