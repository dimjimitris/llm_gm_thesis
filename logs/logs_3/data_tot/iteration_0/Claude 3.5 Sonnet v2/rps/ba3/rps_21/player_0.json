    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the points:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1\n- Paper vs Rock: +3/-3\n- Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1\nThis shows that Paper has the highest potential gain (+3), while Rock and Scissors only offer +1.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might be more likely to choose Rock as it's often seen as a \"strong\" opening move by new players. This is a common psychological pattern.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at expected values:\n- If we choose Paper and they choose Rock, we get +3\n- If we choose Paper and they choose Paper, we get 0\n- If we choose Paper and they choose Scissors, we get -1\nGiven the Psychology Expert's input about Rock being a common opening move, Paper might be our best strategic choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Paper offers the highest potential gain (+3), and even if we're wrong and they choose Scissors, we only lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio favors Paper as our opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I agree that Paper is our best opening move. The potential for high gain (+3) combined with limited downside (-1) makes it strategically sound.\n\n[move] paper This opening move offers the highest potential gain while limiting potential losses.\n"

They're also using strategic thinking (recognizing paper's high reward potential)\n2. They might change their move now since the previous round was a tie\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper first, we need to consider their likely next move. They might anticipate us sticking with paper (since it was a \"safe\" result) or switching to scissors to counter paper.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze the opponent's options:\n1. If they think we'll stick with paper: their best move would be scissors (+1)\n2. If they think we'll switch to scissors: their best move would be rock (+1)\n3. If they think we'll switch to rock: their best move would be paper (+3)\n\nGame Strategist: Since paper offers the highest reward (+3), a sophisticated player might be reluctant to move away from it. However, the tie in round 1 creates pressure to change strategy. I suggest we play rock here - it's a strong counter if they stick to paper (+3), and if they switch to scissors, we still win (+1).\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Players often feel compelled to change their move after a tie, and scissors would be a logical choice to counter our previous paper play. Rock would protect against this while also giving us the potential for a high score if they stick with paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense. Rock gives us good coverage against both potential opponent moves (paper or scissors), with a strong upside potential.\n\n[move] rock A strategic shift that protects against scissors while offering high potential gains against paper.\n"

This could indicate either:\n1. They're using similar strategic logic to us\n2. They might be deliberately mirroring our moves\n3. Pure coincidence, though less likely after two matches\n\nGame Strategist: The mirroring behavior is significant. If they are indeed following our moves, they might:\n1. Continue the mirroring strategy, expecting us to be predictable\n2. Try to break the pattern, anticipating that we've noticed it\n\nData Analyst: Looking at the games so far:\nRound 1: paper vs paper = 0\nRound 2: rock vs rock = 0\nWe need to score points, and scissors would be a logical progression in the rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, if they're truly mirroring us, using scissors might be too predictable. They might expect us to complete the traditional cycle. The question is: are they playing reactively (mirroring our last move) or proactively (predicting our next move)?\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we've had two ties, I suggest breaking the pattern entirely. Let's go back to paper. Here's why:\n1. If they're mirroring our previous move, they'll play rock and we'll win +3\n2. If they try to predict us completing the cycle with scissors, they might play rock to counter it, and again we win +3\n3. If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the Game Strategist. Paper gives us the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. If they're mirroring, we win big.

We should bet strongly on the mirroring pattern continuing. Even if this is a sophisticated opponent, they've invested too much in the mirroring strategy to suddenly break it.\n\nData Analyst: Rock gives us the best expected value against a mirroring opponent who would play scissors.

The probability of this happening by chance is infinitesimally small\n\nGame Strategist: We need to change our approach.
