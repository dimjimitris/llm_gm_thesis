    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) against rock, while rock and scissors only give 1 point when they win. However, paper also risks losing 1 point to scissors.\n\nData Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we can't rely on pattern recognition. We need to consider the most likely move from a new player.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at the risk-reward ratio, I suggest considering paper as it has the highest potential gain (3 points). While it does have a risk of losing 1 point to scissors, this is a relatively small downside compared to the potential upside.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" option. Paper would be effective against this common tendency.\n\nRisk Manager: The worst case with paper is losing 1 point to scissors, while the best case is gaining 3 points against rock. With rock or scissors, we'd only gain 1 point in the best case.\n\nData Analyst: The expected value calculation supports using paper, assuming roughly equal probabilities of opponent moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nBased on the collaborative analysis, I will choose paper as my move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This could mean either:\n1. They have a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might have a preference for paper\n3. It could have been just a coincidence\n\nRisk Manager: Since they matched our paper play, they might be likely to switch to scissors this round, thinking we might play paper again. This is a common psychological pattern in such games.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n- If they expect us to play paper again, they might choose scissors\n- If they think we'll predict their scissors and play rock, they might stick with paper\n- Given the higher payoff for paper (3 points), they might be tempted to stick with it\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, rock would be a strong counter-play. If they switch to scissors as predicted, we win 1 point. If they stick with paper, we only lose 3 points, but there's less likelihood of them repeating paper after a tie.\n\nRisk Manager: I concur with the rock suggestion. It protects against the most likely scenario (them switching to scissors) while accepting a calculated risk against paper repetition.\n\nData Analyst: The opponent's previous paper play gives us some information to work with, and rock provides the best risk-adjusted response based on likely human behavior patterns.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Paper would be optimal here because:\n1. It beats rock if they repeat it\n2. The potential gain (3 points) outweighs the potential loss (1 point)\n3. It breaks the pattern of mirrored moves\n\nData Analyst: There's also a psychological element - after two ties, both players typically look to break the pattern. Paper gives us the highest potential reward while risking minimal loss.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. The risk-reward ratio favors paper here. The potential 3-point gain outweighs the 1-point loss risk, and after two ties, we need to be more aggressive in pursuing points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

Either:\n1. The opponent is extremely good at predicting our moves\n2. We're both using very similar logical patterns\n3. They might be deliberately playing for ties\n\nData Analyst: The pattern is statistically significant now. Three consecutive matches is unlikely by pure chance (1/27 probability). We need to recognize that the opponent is either:\n- Reading our strategy extremely well\n- Using the same strategic thinking process\n- Intentionally matching us\n\nRisk Manager: This is a crucial decision point. Playing conservatively (continuing our logical pattern) has resulted in ties. We need to introduce randomness or make an unexpected move to break this deadlock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that paper has been played twice and rock once, scissors is the least used move. The opponent might not expect it precisely because it's the lowest reward move. Sometimes the best strategy is to break from optimal play to become unpredictable.\n\nData Analyst: Scissors would indeed break both the pattern and the game theory optimal choice (which has led to mirrors so far). It's also effective against the last move played (paper).\n\nRisk Manager: While scissors only offers a 1-point gain, it's worth the risk to break this mirroring pattern. The psychological impact of using an unexpected move might give us an advantage in future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly support the scissors play here. It's the only move that hasn't been used yet, and it directly counters the last move we saw from the opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent has a way to predict our moves exactly\n2. They are using an identical decision-making process\n3. They are deliberately matching us\n\nData Analyst: The probability of four consecutive matches by chance is 1/81 - extremely unlikely. We've now used all three moves, with the sequence: paper -> rock -> paper -> scissors. Looking for patterns within this sequence isn't helpful because our logical attempts at pattern-breaking are being matched.\n\nRisk Manager: We need to acknowledge that our attempts at strategic thinking, including our last attempt to break the pattern with scissors, have been mirrored. Traditional game theory isn't working here.\n\nGame Strategist: In such a situation, when an opponent is perfectly matching moves, we need to embrace true randomness. Any attempt at strategic thinking seems to be predictable to our opponent.\n\nData Analyst: I suggest we use a genuinely random selection. Let me generate a random number between 1-3:\n*generates random number*\nThe random selection suggests rock.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with using true randomness. Our strategic thinking has proven to be predictable, so removing our own bias through randomness might be the only way to break this pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a case where playing \"optimally\" is actually sub-optimal.

This suggests something extraordinary:\n1. The opponent must have access to our moves before making theirs, OR\n2. They are using exactly the same decision-making process, including our attempt at randomization\n\nData Analyst: The probability of five consecutive matches by pure chance is 1/243 - we can effectively rule out coincidence. Even more telling, they matched our \"random\" choice, suggesting they either:\n- Have the same random seed\n- Are not actually playing independently\n- Can see our moves\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical realization moment. We're either:\n- Playing against a mirror of ourselves\n- Playing against an entity that can see our moves\n- Playing against someone who has exactly the same decision-making process\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation, trying to outthink the opponent is futile. Even our attempt at randomness was matched. Let's try something completely different - let's make the simplest, most basic move possible.\n\nData Analyst: Agreed. Complex strategy is pointless when every move is being mirrored. The simplest move might help us understand what's really happening here.\n\nRisk Manager: In this case, the most basic move would be rock - it's often considered the default or instinctive choice in RPS. Using it might help us understand if we're truly in a mirrored game.\n\nGame Strategist: Making the same move we just made (rock) might also help us test if the mirroring is based on our current choice or if there's some other mechanism at play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

The question is: will they mirror again or make another strategic deviation?\n\nRisk Manager: The last time they broke from mirroring, they used paper against rock for maximum points (3). They might be looking for another high-scoring opportunity.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated sophistication, they might expect us to overthink this situation. We need to consider that they:\n1. Could continue mirroring\n2. Might attempt another strategic deviation\n3. Could be expecting us to try to counter their potential deviation\n\nData Analyst: After scissors, the statistically sound move is often rock, as players tend to move in a 'paper-scissors-rock' natural progression. However, they've shown they can read conventional patterns.\n\nRisk Manager: Since they've shown they're willing to risk high-stakes plays (using paper for 3 points), we should prepare for another aggressive move. Paper would give them another opportunity for a high score if we play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest paper for these reasons:\n1. If they're mirroring, it's a tie\n2.

Their last three moves were: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\nThis suggests they might be becoming predictable or tilted after losses.\n\nRisk Manager: Caution is warranted now.

Their last two rock plays both lost to our paper.\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical moment. After three consecutive losses (two to paper), the opponent is likely to:\n1. Be frustrated and potentially emotional\n2. Definitely avoid rock, which has lost twice to us\n3. Either try scissors (which they haven't used in a while) or stick with paper\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent is likely thinking:\n1. \"They keep beating my rock with paper\"\n2. \"They successfully used scissors against my paper\"\n3. \"They seem to be predicting my moves well\"\n4. \"I need to break their winning streak\"\n\nData Analyst: Given their pattern and psychology:\n- They haven't used scissors in several rounds\n- They've lost twice to paper\n- They might finally try scissors to counter our successful paper plays\n\nRisk Manager: This is a high-risk moment. The opponent is likely to make a significant strategy change after three losses. Scissors would be their most logical choice to counter our recent paper success.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock for these reasons:\n1. It counters the likely scissors play we expect from them\n2. They're unlikely to use rock again after losing with it twice\n3. If they use paper, we only lose 3 points, but this seems unlikely given their recent losses to our paper\n4. We're showing we can adapt rather than sticking with our winning paper strategy\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Return to moves that previously worked\n2. Try to double-bluff by repeating their last move\n3. Choose paper for its higher point potential\n4. Become more risk-seeking to break a losing streak\n\nRisk Manager: Given their likely desperation for a win, they might go for the highest potential payoff (paper for 3 points). It's a common psychological response to chase bigger wins when losing.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors because:\n1. It counters the likely paper play we expect from a desperate opponent\n2.

Be completely tilted and make a random choice\n\nData Analyst: In situations of extended losing streaks:\n1. Players often revert to rock as a \"grounding\" move\n2. Complex strategy gives way to basic instincts\n3. The pressure often leads to simpler, more fundamental choices\n\nRisk Manager: Given their state:\n1. Complex strategic plays are less likely\n2. They might revert to rock as a \"safe\" or \"strong\" move\n3. The psychological burden of five losses likely prevents clear strategic thinking\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper because:\n1.

Could be making purely emotional decisions\n\nData Analyst: Under such extreme pressure:\n1. Players often revert to rock as a \"safe\" move\n2. They won't repeat paper after just losing\n3. Scissors might feel too weak\n4. Their cycle suggests rock is next\n\nRisk Manager: Critical factors:\n1. They're unlikely to use paper again after just losing\n2. Rock becomes psychologically appealing as a \"stable\" choice\n3. They need something that feels \"strong\"\n4. Their pattern suggests rock is most likely\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper because:\n1. Rock is most likely from a completely demoralized opponent\n2.
