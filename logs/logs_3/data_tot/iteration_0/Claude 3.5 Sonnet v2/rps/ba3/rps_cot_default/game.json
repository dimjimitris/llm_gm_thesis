Decision logic:\n   - Abandon pattern-based thinking\n   - Abandon psychological analysis\n   - Abandon counter-strategy\n   - Use random selection\n\nFinal decision: Using true randomness (imagining dice roll between 1-3), I get scissors.\n\n[move] scissors Using random selection to break prediction pattern\n",
