Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll consider the payoff structure:\n- Paper vs Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n- Rock and Scissors moves have lower reward/penalty ratios (1 point)\n- Paper is beaten by Scissors for only a -1 point penalty\n\nGiven this analysis, I think paper offers a good risk/reward ratio for a first move. If I win with paper against rock, I get the maximum possible points (3). If I lose to scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] paper I'm choosing paper as my opening move since it offers the best potential reward (3 points against rock) while having a manageable downside risk (-1 points against scissors).\n"
