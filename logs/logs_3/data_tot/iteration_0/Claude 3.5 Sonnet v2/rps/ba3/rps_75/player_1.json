You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I just won with rock vs their scissors\n3. We're both demonstrating ability to adapt and counter-adapt\n\nKey observations:\n- Rock has worked for me twice against their scissors\n- They might expect me to stick with rock after two successes\n- But they've shown they can punish predictable patterns with paper\n\nAfter losing to rock twice with scissors, they're likely to:\n- Strongly consider playing paper to punish rock\n- Be wary of my potential switch to scissors anticipating their paper\n- Want to break out of their scissors-losing pattern\n\nGiven this, I think they're most likely to play paper here - it's the strongest counter to my recent successful rock plays and offers the highest reward. Playing scissors again would be too risky given their recent losses.\n\nTherefore, I'll play scissors:\n- If they play paper as predicted, I win 1 point\n- If they play rock (trying to be unpredictable), I lose 1 point\n- If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating their paper counter to my recent successful rocks\n"
