    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Statistical Analyst - For analyzing probabilities and expected values\n3. Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (+3)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Medium reward (+1)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Medium reward (+1)\n- Same moves: No points (0)\nPlaying paper has the potential for highest reward but also highest risk (-3).\n\nStatistical Analyst: Against a fresh player with no prior history, each move is equally likely to be chosen (1/3 probability). Expected values:\n- Rock: (+1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock) = -0.67\n- Paper: (+3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper) = +0.67\n- Scissors: (+1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors) = 0\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: With a fresh opponent and no prior interaction, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\" and \"safe\". This psychological tendency could be exploited.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, Paper would be a good opening move. It has the highest expected value mathematically, and if the opponent plays the psychologically favored Rock, we get the maximum possible points (+3).\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the analysis. Paper offers the best combination of high reward potential and positive expected value, while also countering the likely \"Rock\" opening from a new player.\n\n[move] paper This move has the highest expected value and counters the common opening move of rock.\n"

They either:\n1. Used similar game theory analysis as us\n2. Are also aware of the psychological tendency to play rock first and countered it\n3. Just made a random choice\n\nFor the second round, we need to consider their likely response knowing they played paper first.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often feel an urge to \"switch things up.\" Additionally, since they played paper (the highest risk/reward move) first, they might be an aggressive player. They might expect us to play paper again and try to counter with scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- If they expect us to play paper again, they'll likely choose scissors (+1)\n- If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might switch to rock\n- They could stay with paper, but that's less likely after a tie\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, rock would be a strong choice because:\n1. It beats scissors if they try to counter our previous paper\n2. It's only vulnerable to paper, which they're less likely to play twice\n3. Worst case is -3 against paper, but that's less likely after they just played it\n\nAI Assistant: I agree. Rock seems like the best strategic choice based on the psychological tendency to switch after a tie and the likelihood they'll try to counter our previous paper play.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play.\n"

They're mirroring our moves deliberately\n2. They're using similar strategic thinking processes\n3. It's coincidental (less likely after two matches)\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's look at their pattern:\n- Round 1: Paper (matched us)\n- Round 2: Rock (matched us)\nIf they are indeed mirroring our moves, they might have a way to see our moves. However, this could also just be coincidence given the limited number of options.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Two ties in a row creates psychological tension - both players will feel a strong urge to break the pattern. If they are mirroring us, we can use this to our advantage. If they're using similar strategic thinking, we need to introduce some unpredictability.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, scissors would be an interesting choice because:\n1. If they're mirroring us, we know they'll play scissors and it will be another tie\n2. If they're trying to break the pattern, they're more likely to play paper (trying to beat our expected rock)\n3. The risk/reward ratio is favorable - we only lose 1 point against rock if we're wrong\n\nAI Assistant: The scissors play makes sense here. It protects against paper (which they might play thinking we'll stick with rock), and if they are mirroring us, we'll at least identify that pattern definitively with a third match.\n\n[move] scissors Breaking the previous pattern while maintaining reasonable risk/reward ratio.\n"

Completely switch strategies\nIn this case, they lost to scissors, so they might:\n- Play rock to beat our potential scissors repeat\n- Feel baited by their paper play and avoid it\n\nStatistical Analyst: Their paper play on round 3 suggests they might have been trying to beat our expected rock (continuing the pattern escalation). Now that they lost, they're most likely to play rock as it:\n- Beats the scissors that just beat them\n- Is psychologically \"strong\" when feeling defensive\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should play paper because:\n1. It beats the highly probable rock response\n2. Even if they play scissors trying to be clever, we only lose 1 point\n3. The +3 reward potential outweighs the -1 risk\n4.

They just succeeded with scissors, which might:\n1. Boost their confidence in aggressive plays\n2. Make them feel they've \"figured out\" our strategy\n3. Tempt them to reuse scissors after its success\n\nStatistical Analyst: After a winning move, players have a \n- High tendency to repeat the successful move\n- Lower tendency to switch to a completely different strategy\nTheir scissors play worked, giving them a strong psychological incentive to use it again.\n\nGame Strategist: This calls for a rock play because:\n1. It directly counters their likely scissors repeat\n2. If they anticipate this and play paper, we lose 3 points, but that's a more complex read that requires them to overcome the natural tendency to repeat success\n3.

But opponent has shown ability to punish predictable patterns\n\nStatistical Analyst: Recent pattern analysis:\n- Our last three: Rock -> Paper -> Rock\n- Opponent's last three: Paper -> Rock -> Scissors\n- They've used all three moves in last three rounds\n- Their moves appear to be cycling, but this could be deceptive\n\nGame Strategist: This situation requires careful consideration:\n1. Rock just worked against scissors\n2. They might expect us to stick with successful rock\n3. Paper would be their obvious counter to expected rock\n4. But they might expect us to expect that\n\nTherefore, scissors would be strong because:\n1. Counters the likely paper play against our successful rock\n2. If they play rock expecting this, we only lose 1\n3. Breaks our rock-paper-rock pattern\n4. They might overthink and play paper expecting us to stick with rock\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with scissors. It's a calculated risk that positions us well against their likely adaptation while avoiding the obvious repeat of our successful rock play. The risk/reward ratio is favorable, and it breaks any pattern they might have identified.\n\n[move] scissors Breaking recent pattern while anticipating paper counter to our rock success.\n"

Rock has been a consistent counter to our scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Critical analysis:\n1. Opponent has successfully used rock multiple times against scissors\n2. They've shown excellent timing with rock plays\n3. They might be identifying our tendency to overthink\n4. Our pattern-breaking attempts often get punished\n\nStatistical Analyst: Pattern examination:\n- Our last four: Paper -> Rock -> Scissors (full cycle)\n- Opponent's last four: Rock -> Rock -> Scissors -> Rock\n- They've used rock very effectively as a defensive play\n- Our moves have become somewhat predictable in trying to be unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: Given this situation:\n1. They've mastered rock timing against our scissors\n2. Paper has been our most successful play overall\n3. They might expect us to avoid scissors after loss\n4. But they also might expect paper as obvious counter to their rock\n\nTherefore, paper would be strong because:\n1. Returns to our most successful play\n2. If they stick with rock (which has worked for them), we win big\n3. Even if they predict this with scissors, we only lose 1\n4. Sometimes the obvious play is best against an opponent who expects complexity\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with paper. While it might seem obvious, our attempts at complex counter-strategies have often backfired. Paper has been our most successful move, and against an opponent who's mastering rock timing, it gives us our best chance at a high-value win.\n\n[move] paper Returning to our most successful play while accepting reasonable risk-reward ratio.\n"

Opponent has countered our last two plays perfectly\n2. They seem to be reading our strategic logic consistently\n3. Our attempts at both complex and straightforward plays are being anticipated\n4. They might be using our own reasoning patterns against us\n\nStatistical Analyst: Pattern analysis:\n- Our last three: Rock -> Scissors -> Paper (complete cycle)\n- Opponent's last three: Scissors -> Rock -> Scissors\n- They've shown strong ability to time their counters\n- Our predictability might be in our decision-making process rather than our moves\n\nGame Strategist: In this crucial situation:\n1. They've successfully used scissors to counter paper\n2. They might expect rock from us to counter their scissors\n3. But that's becoming a predictable response pattern\n4. We need to break out of reactive play\n\nRock would be the obvious counter to their scissors success, but that's likely what they expect. Paper would be risky given their recent scissors success. Therefore, scissors would be strong because:\n1. It's the least expected move after just losing to rock\n2. If they play paper expecting our rock counter, we win\n3. If they play rock again, we only lose 1\n4. Breaks the cycle of them predicting our logical counters\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with scissors. Sometimes the best way to break a strong opponent's predictions is to make the seemingly illogical play. This might disrupt their model of our decision-making process.\n\n[move] scissors Making unconventional play to break opponent's prediction patterns.\n"
