    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - But paper also has the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and scissors have more balanced outcomes (+1/-1)\n\n4. For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - I should avoid the riskiest option (paper) since I don't know their strategy\n   - Between rock and scissors, rock is traditionally a common first move\n   - Playing rock offers protection against scissors while only risking paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Playing conservatively in first round is wise\n   - Rock is a balanced choice that protects against scissors\n   - Even if opponent plays paper, the loss is manageable\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as a conservative opening move, balancing potential gains and losses while gathering information about the opponent.\n"

Overwhelming pattern evidence:\n   - Opponent has played paper in 9 out of 11 rounds\n   - All my scissors plays against paper have won\n   - All my attempts to anticipate change have failed\n   - They're showing remarkable commitment to one strategy\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - Opponent seems to be playing a fixed strategy\n   - They're not adapting despite consistent losses\n   - Previous attempts to outthink simple pattern cost me points\n   - Strategy changes have only hurt my score\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Playing rock would be a serious mistake\n   - Playing paper would only achieve a tie\n   - Playing scissors has been consistently profitable\n   - Overthinking remains the biggest risk\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Continue with proven successful strategy\n   - Scissors has worked every time against their paper\n   - No evidence suggests opponent will change\n   - Simplest strategy is the best strategy here\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors, maintaining the simple counter to their unwavering paper strategy.

Critical analysis of change:\n   - Opponent finally adapted after many paper plays\n   - They successfully predicted my scissors continuation\n   - This was a calculated break from their pattern\n   - They might be starting to play more strategically\n\n3.
