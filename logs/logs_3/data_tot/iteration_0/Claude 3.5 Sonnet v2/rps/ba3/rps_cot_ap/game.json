Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - But paper also has the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and scissors have more balanced outcomes (+1/-1)\n\n4. For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   - I should avoid the riskiest option (paper) since I don't know their strategy\n   - Between rock and scissors, rock is traditionally a common first move\n   - Playing rock offers protection against scissors while only risking paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Playing conservatively in first round is wise\n   - Rock is a balanced choice that protects against scissors\n   - Even if opponent plays paper, the loss is manageable\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as a conservative opening move, balancing potential gains and losses while gathering information about the opponent.\n"

Critical analysis of change:\n   - Opponent finally adapted after many paper plays\n   - They successfully predicted my scissors continuation\n   - This was a calculated break from their pattern\n   - They might be starting to play more strategically\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Opponent has shown they can change strategy\n   - They waited until I was fully committed to scissors\n   - They might feel confident after successful prediction\n   - Question is: will they return to paper or continue adapting?\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors again is risky after being countered\n   - Playing rock would tie if they repeat rock\n   - Playing paper would win big against their rock\n   - Need to recover from negative score\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent broke pattern after long paper streak\n   - They're unlikely to immediately switch back to paper\n   - They're likely to either:\n   a) Stick with successful rock play\n   b) Try to counter what they think I'll play\n   - Paper gives best risk/reward against likely rock continuation\n\n[move] paper I choose paper, betting they'll either continue with rock after success or expect me to play rock defensively.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
