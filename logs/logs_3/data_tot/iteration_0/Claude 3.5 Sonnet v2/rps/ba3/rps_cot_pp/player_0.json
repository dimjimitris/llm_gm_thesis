    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives moderate reward (1 point)\n   - Scissors beating paper gives moderate reward (1 point)\n\n3. Looking at the risks:\n   - Choosing rock risks losing 3 points to paper\n   - Choosing paper risks losing 1 point to scissors\n   - Choosing scissors risks losing 1 point to rock\n\n4. Strategic consideration:\n   - Paper has highest reward potential (3 points)\n   - But paper also has safer risk (-1 vs -3)\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as first move as it feels \"strong\"\n\n5. Based on this analysis:\n   - Paper is the optimal first move\n   - It can win big (3 points) against expected rock\n   - If we lose, we only lose 1 point to scissors\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper\n\n[move] paper (Choosing paper as it offers highest reward potential while having manageable risk)\n"

Recent pattern:\n   - Rock tie \u2192 Paper tie\n   - Opponent matching moves consistently\n   - Game becoming very defensive with many ties\n\n3. Statistical observation:\n   - We haven't had scissors after a paper tie yet\n   - Scissors after paper would be aggressive play\n   - Both players seem to be thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - Frustration with ties might lead to aggressive play\n   - Both players likely want to break tie cycle\n   - Basic strategy suggests scissors after paper tie\n\n5. Meta-strategy:\n   - If scissors is obvious play, opponent might counter with rock\n   - But they might expect me to think that and stick with paper\n   - Given high number of ties, opponent might be risk-averse\n   - Rock would be safest counter to expected scissors\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter expected scissors play\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating aggressive scissors play after paper tie, while staying safe against continued paper)\n"

Opponent's patterns:\n   - Strong at reading obvious counters\n   - Good at punishing aggressive plays\n   - Often matches defensive moves\n   - Might expect me to play safe due to deficit\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After rock tie:\n     - Paper is obvious counter (+3 points)\n     - But obvious moves have been punished\n     - However, opponent might expect me to avoid obvious\n     - My deficit might make me predictable\n   - Need for points forces aggressive play\n   - Even if they read paper play, scissors only costs -1\n   - Potential +3 reward justifies risk\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper\n\n[move] paper (Taking necessary risk for high reward, need +3 points to recover from deficit)\n"
