    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n3. Strategic Advisor - For developing winning tactics\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Rock vs Paper: -3 points\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1 point\n- Rock vs Rock: 0 points\n- Paper vs Rock: +3 points\n- Paper vs Scissors: -1 point\n- Paper vs Paper: 0 points\n- Scissors vs Paper: +1 point\n- Scissors vs Rock: -1 point\n- Scissors vs Scissors: 0 points\n\nThe highest potential gain is +3 with Paper beating Rock. The worst loss is -3 with Rock losing to Paper.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is a fresh player and the first move, players often tend to choose Rock as their first move as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening. However, they might also try to outthink this common knowledge.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this analysis, I suggest playing Paper for the first move. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays Rock (common first move), we get +3 points\n2. If opponent plays Paper, we get 0 points (tie)\n3. If opponent plays Scissors, we lose only 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio is favorable here.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with this analysis.

This suggests they might also be using strategic thinking, as paper is indeed a strong opening move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often try to \"outthink\" their opponent by predicting what they'll do next. Given that paper was just played, they might expect us to stick with paper (as it worked safely) or switch to scissors (to counter paper). There's a psychological tendency to avoid repeating the same move after a tie.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze the likely scenarios:\n1. If opponent expects us to play paper again and tries to counter it, they'll play scissors\n2. If opponent expects us to switch to scissors and tries to counter that, they'll play rock\n3. If opponent follows the \"don't repeat after tie\" principle, they're unlikely to play paper\n\nGiven this analysis, playing rock would be a good choice because:\n- It beats scissors (which they might play to counter our previous paper)\n- If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n- The only downside is if they play paper (-3 points), but they're less likely to repeat paper\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While rock has the biggest potential downside (-3), the behavioral analysis suggests it's a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Let's go with rock.\n\n[move] rock Our previous paper move resulted in a tie, and opponents often try to counter the previous move, making scissors a likely choice from them.

Let's analyze the current situation - we've shown paper and rock, winning with rock most recently.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a loss, players often adjust their strategy significantly. Given that our opponent lost with scissors, they're likely to:\n1. Feel that their attempt to be clever (using scissors) backfired\n2. Want to counter our successful rock move\n3. Be more cautious, potentially reverting to a \"safer\" move\n\nStrategic Advisor: The opponent's likely moves based on this analysis:\n1. Paper - to beat our winning rock move (most likely)\n2. Rock - if they're playing very cautiously after their loss\n3. Scissors - least likely as it just lost them points\n\nI recommend playing scissors because:\n- It beats paper, which is their most likely move (trying to counter our rock)\n- If they play rock (cautious play), we only lose 1 point\n- If they repeat scissors (unlikely), it's a tie\n\nGame Theorist: The risk-reward ratio looks favorable.

After their first win, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Expect us to play rock to counter their scissors\n   - Feel confident enough to continue their no-rock strategy\n2. The opponent seems to have a strong aversion to rock, possibly due to its all-or-nothing nature (-3/+3 outcomes)\n\nI recommend rock because:\n- If they stick with their winning scissors move (likely due to recent success), we win +1\n- If they finally play rock, we only lose 3 points (but seems unlikely given their history)\n- If they play paper to counter our expected rock, we lose 3 points\n- Their consistent avoidance of rock makes paper less likely here\n\nGame Theorist: Agree. Their pattern suggests they prefer the smaller point swings of scissors/paper interactions (+1/-1) over the larger swings with rock (+3/-3).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Their first win with scissors might make them overconfident in that move.

The opponent's behavior has moved beyond game theory into pattern behavior. Their scissors preference is overriding strategic considerations.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The frequency of scissors plays suggests this is their \"comfort move.\" After a tie, they're likely to stay in their comfort zone rather than risk a new strategy.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis of their behavioral pattern is compelling.\n\n[move] rock Despite our opponent's losses to rock before, their strong preference for scissors (5 out of 8 moves) and complete avoidance of rock suggests they might stick with their comfort move of scissors again.

They're still avoiding rock completely after 9 rounds\n5. This suggests either extreme risk aversion or a rigid playing style\n\nStrategic Advisor: However, this might be the breaking point:\n1. Three losses to the same move combination should force a change\n2. Even a rigid player would likely adapt after this much negative reinforcement\n3. They must realize we're expecting scissors again\n4. They've shown they can play paper (used it twice early in the game)\n\nI recommend scissors because:\n- After three losses to rock vs scissors, they almost HAVE to switch to paper\n- Their only wins/ties have come from paper or scissors plays\n- They still seem to avoid rock completely\n- If they do stick with scissors again (seems unlikely now), we get a tie\n- If they play rock (still seems unlikely given their history), we lose only 1\n\nGame Theorist: Agree. The logical break point has been reached. Even a pattern player should shift after this much punishment.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Yes, three losses to the same move combination is typically enough to break even the most entrenched patterns. Expect paper here.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is compelling - this many losses should force a change.\n\n[move] scissors After losing three times to rock versus their scissors, opponent must finally change strategy. Expecting them to switch to paper to counter our successful rock plays, scissors gives us the best chance of success while minimizing potential losses.\n"

They successfully predicted our paper play\n2. They've moved away from their rock safety net\n3. They might feel they're reading our strategy well again\n4. The string of ties (except Round 18) suggests cautious play\n5. They might think we're becoming predictable\n\nStrategic Advisor: Let's analyze deeply:\n1. After successfully matching our paper:\n   - They might feel confident in their prediction abilities\n   - Could expect us to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Might try to stay one step ahead\n   - Have shown they can adapt beyond just rock\n2. The game has become more about prediction and counter-prediction\n\nI recommend rock because:\n- If they expect scissors (to counter their paper) and play rock themselves, we tie\n- If they try scissors (predicting our scissors), we win +1\n- If they stick with paper, we lose 3\n- Their recent success in prediction might make them try to anticipate our next move rather than just match\n\nGame Theorist: The game has evolved into a complex prediction battle. They've shown they can adapt and think ahead.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After successfully breaking away from their rock pattern and matching our paper, they might feel confident enough to try predicting our next strategic shift.\n\nAI Assistant: The shift in their strategy suggests more sophisticated thinking.\n\n[move] rock After successfully matching our paper play, opponent might expect us to use scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock to beat our scissors. Rock gives us a tie in this case while positioning us well against a potential scissors play if they try to get ahead of our strategy.\n"

They just achieved their first +3 win of the game\n2. This is a major confidence boost for them\n3. Their paper play was strategic, not just matching\n4. They've overcome their risk aversion\n5. They might feel they've found a winning strategy\n\nStrategic Advisor: Complex situation:\n1. After their most successful play:\n   - They might feel emboldened to continue aggressive play\n   - Could stick with paper after its big success\n   - Might expect us to counter with scissors\n   - Their confidence is likely at a peak\n2. But they also know we must adjust to this loss\n\nI recommend scissors because:\n- If they stick with paper (likely after such success), we win +1\n- If they play rock (reverting to safety), we lose 1\n- If they play scissors (trying to counter our scissors), we tie\n- After such a big win, players often stick with what just worked\n- The psychological boost from a +3 win often leads to strategy repetition\n\nGame Theorist: Their first maximum-point victory might make them overconfident in their paper strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Success of this magnitude often leads to strategy repetition, especially when it's their first time achieving it.\n\nAI Assistant: The psychological impact of their biggest win seems most relevant here.\n\n[move] scissors After scoring their first and biggest win (+3) with paper, opponent is likely to stick with this successful strategy. Their confidence boost suggests they might maintain paper play rather than switch, making scissors our best counter while limiting potential losses.\n"

They lost immediately after their biggest win\n2. Their confidence from the +3 win was quickly deflated\n3. They've now lost with paper after it gave them their best success\n4. They might feel we're reading their moves too well\n5. They're likely feeling frustrated by this quick reversal\n\nStrategic Advisor: Important analysis:\n1. After this rapid reversal of fortune:\n   - They might abandon paper after two different negative outcomes\n   - Could return to rock (their historically safe move)\n   - Might try scissors to break the pattern\n   - Need to recover from this momentum shift\n2. The psychological impact of losing right after their biggest win is significant\n\nI recommend rock because:\n- If they play scissors (trying to break their paper losses), we win +1\n- If they return to rock (their proven safe move), we tie\n- If they stick with paper (seems unlikely after two failures), we lose 3\n- Players often revert to conservative plays after having aggressive strategies punished\n\nGame Theorist: The quick punishment of their aggressive paper strategy might push them back to more conservative plays.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After having their biggest success immediately countered, players typically revert to safer strategies. Their historical comfort with rock makes this especially likely.\n\nAI Assistant: The psychological factors suggest a likely return to conservative play.\n\n[move] rock After losing with paper immediately following their biggest win, opponent likely abandons this now-punished strategy. They might either return to their \"safe\" rock strategy or try scissors to break the pattern. Rock positions us well against either possibility.\n"

They've won with paper twice in three rounds\n2. They might have identified our pattern\n3. Our rock plays have been costly (-3 twice)\n4. They seem to have overcome their earlier paper failures\n5.
