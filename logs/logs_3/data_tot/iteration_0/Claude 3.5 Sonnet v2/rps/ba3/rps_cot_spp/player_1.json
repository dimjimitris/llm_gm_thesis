    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) while risking only a small loss (-1 point against scissors).\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the Strategic Planner. Paper provides asymmetric payoff potential: high upside (3 points) with limited downside (-1 point). Against a fresh player with no established patterns, this risk-reward ratio is favorable.\n\nGame Theorist: The suggested move aligns with game theory principles. Paper is a reasonable first move as it maximizes potential gain while minimizing potential loss in this uncertainty scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio with potential for highest points (3) while risking minimum loss (-1).\n"

They're using similar strategic reasoning to us\n2. They have a preference for paper\n3.

In that case, they might switch to rock to counter our scissors. However, if they're a pattern player, they might stick with paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given this uncertainty, rock provides an interesting option:\n- If they stick with paper, we lose 3 points\n- If they switch to scissors (expecting us to play paper), we win 1 point\n- If they switch to rock, we tie\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n- If they stick with paper (which they might), we win 1 point\n- If they switch to rock (trying to beat our potential scissors), we lose 1 point\n- If they switch to scissors, we tie\nThe potential loss is smaller than with rock (-1 vs -3)\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with the Strategic Planner. Scissors provides a balanced risk-reward profile in this situation, with the potential to capitalize if they stick with paper while limiting our downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Based on the previous tie with paper, scissors provides a good balance of potentially capitalizing on repeated paper play while limiting potential losses.\n"

If they're following this strategic thinking pattern, they might expect us to play paper to beat their rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's break down what we know:\n1. We're at -1 points currently\n2. Their moves show strategic adaptation rather than random play\n3. If they're anticipating us to play paper (to counter their last rock), they might play scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given their apparent strategic thinking, we need to be one step ahead. If they expect us to play paper (to beat their previous rock), and they play scissors to counter that, then rock would be our optimal move.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree with rock for these reasons:\n- It beats scissors if they try to counter our expected paper play\n- Even if they play paper, the -3 point loss is acceptable given we need to break this pattern\n- If they play rock, we at least tie and stop losing points\n\nRisk Analyst: The upside-downside analysis of rock is reasonable here:\n- Win vs scissors: +1 point\n- Tie vs rock: 0 points\n- Lose vs paper: -3 points\nGiven their shown strategic adaptation, they're less likely to return to paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's pattern of strategic adaptation and the likelihood they'll play scissors to counter our expected paper move, rock provides the best counter-strategy.\n"

They might be following a fixed rotation (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), in which case paper would be next\n2. Or they might break the pattern, expecting us to predict paper as their next move\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current score is 0 points (-1 + 1). We need to consider:\n- If they continue the pattern: paper would be next\n- If they try to trick us: they might stick with scissors or switch to rock\n- Their losses might influence them to change strategy entirely\n\nGame Theorist: Given that we just won with rock, they might expect us to stick with rock (winner's tendency).

Either they're stubborn and returned to paper despite just losing to scissors\n2. Or they thought we wouldn't play scissors twice in a row\n3. The paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper sequence suggests they might be following a fixed pattern regardless of outcomes\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current score is +1 points (-1 + 1 + 1). The opponent has now lost twice in a row, which often triggers a strong strategy change in players. They're likely to:\n1. Avoid paper since it just lost twice\n2. Possibly play rock to beat our successful scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've lost twice now, game psychology suggests they're highly likely to switch to a defensive move. Rock would be their safest choice to counter our successful scissors play.\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend we play paper because:\n1. It beats rock, which is their most likely defensive move\n2. The potential reward is highest (+3)\n3. Even if they play scissors, we only lose 1 point\n4. They've shown they can be predictable in their patterns\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree.

We're currently ahead, but not by so much that we need to play ultra-conservatively.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Based on opponent psychology after two losses and their likely defensive switch to rock, paper offers the best potential reward while maintaining acceptable risk.\n"

Become more aggressive to recover points quickly\n2. Or completely randomize their strategy to become unpredictable\n3. Given their recent rock play got punished heavily (-3), they're unlikely to use rock again\n\nRisk Analyst: This is a critical moment:\n- We're significantly ahead (+4 points)\n- They're likely feeling pressured to make a comeback\n- They just lost 3 points, their biggest loss yet\n- They might be emotional and make an aggressive play\n\nGame Theorist: In this situation, players often choose scissors as an aggressive move because:\n1. It counters the paper that just beat them\n2. It's seen as an aggressive/attacking move psychologically\n3. It helps avoid another -3 point loss from paper vs rock\n\nStrategic Planner: I recommend rock because:\n1. It directly counters the likely scissors play\n2. The win would only be +1, but that's fine given our lead\n3. If they play paper hoping to get a big +3 win, we only lose 3 points\n4.
