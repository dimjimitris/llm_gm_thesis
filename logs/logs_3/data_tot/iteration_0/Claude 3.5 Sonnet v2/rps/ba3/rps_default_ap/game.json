They're likely feeling very frustrated and may be seeking a \"safe\" option\n\nIn such situations, after multiple losses and failed strategies, players often:\n1. Avoid repeating recent losing moves (making paper unlikely)\n2. Shy away from scissors (which has failed them multiple times)\n3. Resort to rock as a \"safe\" defensive choice\n\nRock would represent their most conservative option - it's a defensive move that at worst loses 3 points (vs paper) but could win them a point against scissors.\n\n[move] paper Based on their likely psychological state after multiple losses and their probable desire for a \"safe\" play, I predict they'll choose rock, so I'm choosing paper.\n"
