Risk assessment:\n   - Paper beats rock (+1) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock ties with rock (0) but loses to paper (-1)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1) but beats paper (+1)\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Since opponent likely expects paper from me, and might switch to scissors\n   - I should not play paper as it's too predictable\n   - Rock would be safe against potential scissors\n   - But I need to take calculated risks to win\n\n6.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If they stay with rock pattern, paper wins\n   - If they try to counter my potential paper, scissors wins\n   - If they try paper again (their only winning move so far), rock wins\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - Three rounds with no wins might make them more aggressive\n   - They might expect me to play rock again\n   - The logical counter to repeated rock is paper\n\n5. Strategy formulation:\n   - Playing rock again would be too predictable\n   - Paper could win against their preferred rock\n   - However, they might anticipate this and play scissors\n   - Given their conservative style and lack of scissors usage, paper seems safer\n\n6.
