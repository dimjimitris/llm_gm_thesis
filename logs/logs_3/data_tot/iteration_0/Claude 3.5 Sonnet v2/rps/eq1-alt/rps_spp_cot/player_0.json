    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Specialist in recognizing patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - Expert in evaluating risk-reward trade-offs\n\nLet's start the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider the basic game theory approach. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, no single move dominates others, as each move beats one option and loses to another. Without prior information, each move has equal expected value.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. With a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze yet. However, research shows that in RPS, \"rock\" is often the most common first move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given this insight, we might consider playing \"paper\" to counter the potential \"rock\" move. However, we should be aware that if the opponent plays \"scissors,\" we'll lose. The expected value is still neutral if probabilities are truly random, but we're incorporating the psychological factor here.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. It counters the most likely first move (rock), and even if we lose to scissors, we're making an educated guess based on common player psychology.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Your analysis makes sense. Let's go with paper for our first move.\n\n[move] paper I choose paper for this first move, considering that new players often start with rock.\n"

They might expect us to stick with paper and try to counter it with scissors\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they matched our strategic thinking in round 1, we're likely dealing with a thoughtful player. In such cases, many players tend to shift their move after a tie, expecting their opponent to do the same.\n\nRisk Manager: If we assume they're likely to change their move and try to counter our previous paper play, they might choose scissors. In that case, we should switch to rock to protect ourselves.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the Risk Manager. The most likely scenario is that they'll try to beat our previous move (paper) by playing scissors, so rock would be our best counter.\n\nGame Strategist: The logic is sound. Playing rock also protects us against the most dangerous scenario (them playing scissors), while only losing to paper, which they just played and might be less likely to repeat.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

Round 2: Rock vs Rock\nThis suggests either:\n- They might be following our moves somehow\n- They're using very similar strategic thinking\n- Or it could just be coincidence, though less likely after two matches\n\nGame Strategist: The double-matching pattern is significant. If they're using similar strategic logic, they might expect us to follow the natural progression of the game. After rock, many strategists would move to scissors to complete the cycle.\n\nRisk Manager: However, if they've been matching us perfectly so far, we need to consider:\n1. Should we break the expected pattern?\n2. Will they anticipate us breaking the pattern?\n3. If they've been successfully predicting our moves, should we try to predict their prediction?\n\nPattern Analyst: Given that they've matched us twice, I'm leaning towards them either:\na) Following our moves through some means (though this seems unlikely)\nb) Using very similar strategic thinking processes\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest we break the expected pattern. If they're using similar strategic thinking, they might expect scissors next. Let's play paper instead - it breaks the natural progression and would win against their potential rock move (if they try to counter our expected scissors).\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

First two rounds: They matched us (Paper-Paper, Rock-Rock)\n2. Third round: They played scissors against our paper, breaking the matching pattern\nThis might indicate they're not actually following our moves, but perhaps we've been following their strategy until we broke pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: This is the first real data point about their independent decision-making. They chose scissors when we broke pattern with paper. This could mean:\n1. They might be upset about losing and seek revenge with the same move\n2. They might switch strategies completely after this loss\n3. They might revert to a basic pattern now that the matching sequence is broken\n\nRisk Manager: The stakes are higher now as we have a positive score (+1). We should play more defensively to protect our lead. The opponent has shown they're willing to break patterns and take risks.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their scissors play last round and their demonstrated ability to think strategically, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors hoping we overthink\n2. Switch to rock expecting us to play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n3. Switch to paper trying to establish a new pattern\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock here. It's the defensive play against their previous scissors move, and it also wins against any repeated scissors play if they're persistence-minded after their loss.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Rock is the safest play here - it prevents the worst-case scenario of them repeating scissors, and even if they play paper, we only lose one point, keeping us at neutral overall.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The defensive strategy makes sense given our current lead.\n\n[move] rock I choose rock as a defensive move, protecting against potential repeated scissors while maintaining a relatively safe position with our current lead.\n"

They may be using reverse psychology against our defensive play\n\nGame Strategist: The consecutive scissors plays suggest either:\n1. They're being aggressive with repeated scissors\n2.

Paper seems too obvious a choice after two scissors plays. They've demonstrated sophisticated thinking and might be baiting us into paper to counter with rock.\n\nRisk Manager: Scissors is also a balanced risk - it wins against paper, ties against scissors, and only loses to rock.

Simple plays have sometimes succeeded unexpectedly\n3. We need to maintain this simpler approach that just brought us success\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with maintaining the simpler approach, but with a twist:\n1. They just lost to scissors with rock\n2. A natural response would be to counter scissors with rock again\n3. Instead of overthinking, let's play the basic counter to their last move\n\nPattern Analyst: Their last move was rock. Following our new simplified approach, the basic counter would be paper.\n\nRisk Manager: Yes, paper is the fundamental play here:\n1. It directly counters their last move (rock)\n2. We're not trying to predict multi-level strategies\n3. We're just playing solid, fundamental RPS\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Let's stick to the simplified approach that just worked for us.

Our simplified strategy didn't work this time\n3. Rock appears to be their \"comfort move\" - they return to it often\n4. Historical rock plays: early match, then three in a row, one break, now back to rock\n\nRisk Manager: We're at -1 points again. Looking at the patterns:\n1. We lose when we think we've figured them out\n2. We sometimes win when we make unexpected plays\n3. They seem to favor rock significantly in their strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Given their strong preference for rock, we have two options:\n1. Play paper to counter their apparent rock preference\n2. Recognize this might be another trap and play something else\n\nPattern Analyst: Here's what's interesting - they've played rock so many times that it almost seems like they're using reverse psychology. They know we see their rock preference, but they keep winning with it.\n\nRisk Manager: In this situation, I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they're trying to bait us into paper, scissors protects against that\n2. If they play rock again, we're no worse off than our current position\n3. If they try paper thinking we'll play paper, we win\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with scissors. It's a balanced play that:\n1. Protects against them baiting us into paper\n2.
