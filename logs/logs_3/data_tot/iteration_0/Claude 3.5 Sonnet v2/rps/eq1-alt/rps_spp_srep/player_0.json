    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The game is symmetric with each move having equal winning and losing matchups. Without additional information, no move has a theoretical advantage.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is the first move against a new player, they might lean towards rock as it's often a common first choice for many players due to its perceived \"strength\" in human psychology.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's look at the payoff matrix:\n- If we play paper: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs paper (0)\n- If we play rock: Win vs scissors (+1), Lose vs paper (-1), Tie vs rock (0)\n- If we play scissors: Win vs paper (+1), Lose vs rock (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the Psychology Expert's insight about rock being a common first move, and the Risk Analyst's payoff analysis, I suggest we play paper. This would beat the psychologically favored rock move while having equal chances against other moves.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That seems like a reasonable strategy. Paper would counter the psychologically favored first move of rock, while maintaining equal odds against other possibilities.\n\n[move] paper (Countering potential first-move rock bias while maintaining balanced odds against other moves)\n"

They have a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They have their own paper-bias for first moves\n3. It was just coincidence\n\nPsychology Expert: After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move, thinking their opponent will also change. However, since both players might think this way, there's a psychological game of double-thinking involved.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have a few options:\n1. Stay with paper: Our opponent might think we'll change and switch to rock\n2. Switch to scissors: This would beat paper if they stick to it\n3. Switch to rock: This would beat scissors if they're thinking one level deeper\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at the common patterns:\n- After a tie, many players tend to switch their move\n- If they expect us to switch, they might switch too\n- The safest statistical play might be scissors, as it beats paper (if they stick) and ties scissors (if they make the same reasoning as us)\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the Risk Analyst. Scissors provides a good balance of risk and reward here - it beats paper if they stick, ties with scissors if they follow similar logic, and only loses to rock which requires them to think two levels ahead.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis makes sense.

If we think they'll expect rock from us, they might play paper to counter it. Therefore, we should play scissors to counter their paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The repeated ties might also make them more likely to try to \"win\" this round rather than play for another tie, pushing them toward a counter-strategy rather than matching again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, scissors seems optimal again, but for different reasons than last time. It would:\n- Beat paper if they try to counter our expected rock\n- Tie with scissors if they repeat their last move\n- Only lose to rock, which would be a less likely choice given the psychological factors at play\n\n[move] scissors (Maintaining scissors to counter potential paper play while protecting against move repetition)\n"

In such cases, introducing randomness can be beneficial to avoid being predictable.\n\nPsychology Expert: After multiple ties and one loss, they might be more inclined to play aggressively this round to secure a win. This could manifest as scissors to beat our expected paper repetition.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Considering all factors, I believe rock is our best move because:\n1.

If they're using a one-round delay mirroring strategy, they would play rock again. If they're using similar strategic thinking, they might expect us to shift to paper to beat their expected rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the strong mirroring pattern, we should assume they'll either:\n1.

We've had two consecutive ties\n2. We're matching moves more frequently late game\n3. The pressure to break the tie sequence is building\n4. Both players seem to be thinking very similarly\n\nRisk Analyst: Current situation:\n- Still at 0 net points (6 wins, 6 losses, 7 ties)\n- Matching rate increasing (37% of all moves)\n- Three different moves in last three rounds (rock\u2192scissors\u2192?)\n- Late game tension might force aggressive plays\n\nStrategic Planner: They might be thinking:\n1. We'll switch from scissors after two ties\n2. We might play rock to beat their expected scissors\n3. They could try paper to beat our expected rock\n4. The matching pattern might continue\n\nGame Theorist: The increasing frequency of ties suggests:\n1. Both players are using similar strategic reasoning\n2. The pressure of late game is leading to conservative plays\n3. Breaking this pattern could be decisive\n4. Simple strategies might be more effective than complex ones\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given this analysis, I believe paper is our best move because:\n1. It breaks our recent scissors play while remaining aggressive\n2. It beats rock if they play defensively after two ties\n3. If they play scissors again, we only stay at net 0\n4. At this late stage, making a bold move could be decisive\n5.
