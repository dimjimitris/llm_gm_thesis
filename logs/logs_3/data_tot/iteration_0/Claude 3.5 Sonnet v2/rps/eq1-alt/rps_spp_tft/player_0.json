    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Since we're playing against a fresh player and this is the first move, we should consider the basic game theory principles. In Rock Paper Scissors, no single move dominates others, making it a balanced game. However, studies show that \"Rock\" is often a common first move for many players due to its perceived strength.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no previous data about the opponent, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, we can use statistical insights about common opening moves in RPS games.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that this is a fresh start, we should consider a balanced approach. While Rock is common, skilled players might anticipate this and choose Paper. Paper has a slight psychological advantage as it's perceived as less aggressive than Rock and more sophisticated than Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Paper. It counters the common opening Rock, and if our opponent plays Scissors (least common opener), we only lose one point. The risk-reward ratio seems favorable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's make this move and then observe the opponent's response for future rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Paper provides a good balance of risk and potential reward for an opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper This is a strategic opening move based on game theory principles and common player behavior.\n"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nPattern Analyst: Interesting! Our opponent also chose Paper in the first round. This could mean several things:\n1. They might be using similar game theory principles as us\n2. They might be a strategic player rather than a random player\n3. For the next move, they might:\n   - Switch to a different move expecting us to repeat Paper\n   - Keep Paper hoping we'll switch to Rock\n   - Try to outthink us by predicting our prediction\n\nGame Strategist: When both players show strategic thinking (as evidenced by choosing Paper first), the game often becomes a mental battle of prediction levels. The key is to stay one step ahead without overthinking.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that our opponent demonstrated strategic thinking with Paper first, they're likely to switch moves now. Most strategic players avoid repeating the same move after a tie, as it becomes predictable. We should consider what they think we'll do.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect us to switch from Paper (common after a tie), they might play Scissors to beat our predicted Rock. Therefore, we should play Rock to beat their likely Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I concur. The psychology of RPS shows that after a tie, players often try to gain advantage by playing what beats their opponent's previous move.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock also provides decent protection - if we're wrong and they play Paper, we lose just one point, but if we're right and they play Scissors, we gain a point. The risk-reward ratio is acceptable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Based on the psychological tendency of players to switch moves after a tie, and anticipating our opponent might play Scissors to beat our predicted Paper.\n"

Either thinking very similarly to us\n2. Or possibly mirroring our moves (though they'd need to predict them)\n3.

However, if our opponent is indeed thinking similarly to us, they might reach the same conclusion. We need to get ahead of this thinking.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect scissors to be the natural next move, they might play rock to counter it. Therefore, we should play paper to beat their rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Most players would see scissors as the \"obvious\" next move to complete the cycle. By playing paper, we:\n1. Beat the rock they might play to counter scissors\n2.

This suggests they might be using a sophisticated prediction system or have found a pattern in our decision-making\n\nGame Strategist: This is extraordinary:\n1. The opponent's matching rate is too high to be coincidental\n2. They must be either predicting our moves through pattern analysis\n3. Or possibly using some form of systematic matching strategy\n\nRisk Manager: This situation requires a complete strategy revision:\n1. Our conventional strategic thinking isn't working against their matching\n2. We need to consider if they have access to our decision process\n3. A radical departure from our previous patterns is needed\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's consider a meta-strategy:\n1. If they're predicting based on our previous patterns, we need to break those completely\n2. The fact that they've matched Scissors suggests they're not just defaulting to Rock under pressure\n3. They might be using our own strategic reasoning against us\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper for two reasons:\n1. It's the least expected move after Scissors-Scissors (most would play Rock)\n2. If they are indeed using our strategic thinking process, they might expect us to play Rock to beat their predicted Paper\n\nRisk Manager: While Paper is risky, at this point any move is equally risky given their matching ability. We need to focus on breaking their prediction pattern rather than playing it safe.\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. Paper also has the psychological advantage of being counter-intuitive after Scissors, which might finally break their successful prediction streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Making a counter-intuitive choice to break the opponent's remarkable prediction accuracy while avoiding the common progression to Rock after Scissors.\n"
