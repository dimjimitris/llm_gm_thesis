Without any prior information:\n- All moves are equally viable\n- No move has inherent advantage\n- Best to start with a basic move\n\n4. Strategy for first move:\n- Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n- Using paper could give advantage if opponent uses rock\n- Paper also provides good information for next round\n\n5.
