    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any historical data, each move has equal theoretical value.\n\n4. However, in first-time games, players often choose rock as their initial move because:\n   - Rock is perceived as a \"strong\" opening\n   - It's a common psychological tendency\n   - It's often the first move people think of\n\n5. Given this reasoning, I should counter the likely rock play with paper.\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first round against a new player, I'm choosing paper to counter the commonly chosen opening move of rock.\n"

Psychological factors:\n   - Three ties creates immense pressure to break pattern\n   - Both players know we're thinking similarly\n   - There's a strong urge to \"outsmart\" the mirror\n   - The obvious next move might seem too obvious\n\n4. Breaking the cycle options:\n   - Continue the sequence (would be rock next)\n   - Break sequence completely\n   - Double-back to previous move\n   - Make the counter to the sequence continuation\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After paper-paper tie, options are:\n     * Follow sequence to rock (predictable)\n     * Stay with paper (unlikely after tie)\n     * Go to scissors (breaks pattern)\n   - They might expect me to continue the sequence with rock\n   - They might think I'll try to be clever and break pattern\n   - In high-pressure situations, players often revert to basic moves\n\n[move] scissors Since we've had three ties and they might expect me to continue the sequence with rock, they're likely to play paper to counter that expected rock. Therefore, I'll play scissors to break both the tie streak and counter their likely paper play.\n"

Psychological factors after a tie:\n   - Ties often create strategic tension\n   - Players rarely triple-down on same move after tie\n   - Both players know we're reading each other\n   - Both will try to gain advantage from tie situation\n\n4. Their likely thought process:\n   - \"Scissors worked once, tied once\"\n   - \"They'll definitely expect me to change now\"\n   - \"They might try to counter scissors again\"\n   - \"Need to stay one step ahead\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie:\n     * Third scissors would be highly unlikely\n     * They might expect me to play rock to beat scissors\n     * Could try paper to beat expected rock\n     * Or use rock as safe option\n   - Players rarely use same move three times in a row\n   - Especially after a tie exposes the pattern\n\n[move] paper Since they've used scissors twice (win then tie) and might expect me to play rock to counter potential scissors, I predict they'll use rock as a safer option, breaking their scissors pattern. Therefore, I'll use paper to beat their expected rock.\n"
