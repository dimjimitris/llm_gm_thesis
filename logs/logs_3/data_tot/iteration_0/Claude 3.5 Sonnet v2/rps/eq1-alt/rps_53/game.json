Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. This is the first round against a fresh player\n- I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns\n- All moves are equally viable at this point\n\n2. Analyzing the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+1/-1)  \n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n- Same moves result in tie (0/0)\n\n3. Strategy considerations for first move:\n- Without knowing opponent's tendencies, a balanced approach is best\n- Rock is often a common first move for many players\n- Choosing Paper would beat a Rock-playing opponent\n- Even if opponent doesn't play Rock, Paper isn't at huge disadvantage\n\n4.

        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence analysis:\n   - They won with scissors, breaking my streak\n   - Just tied with mutual scissors\n   - Shows they stayed aggressive\n   - First tie in many rounds\n\n2. Current game dynamics:\n   - Momentum has slowed with tie\n   - They've shown commitment to scissors lately\n   - The tie might embolden them to continue aggressive play\n   - Or they might expect me to counter scissors now\n\n3. Psychology of ties:\n   - Creates tension and uncertainty\n   - Players often try to \"win\" the tie\n   - Many expect opponent to switch after tie\n   - Some stick with tied move expecting opponent to switch\n\n4. Their likely thought process:\n   - \"Scissors has worked well recently\"\n   - \"They might expect me to switch after tie\"\n   - \"Could they predict I'll stay with scissors?\"\n   - \"Should I counter their expected counter?\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie:\n     * They might stick with scissors (showing confidence)\n     * Could switch to rock expecting my paper\n     * Might play paper expecting my rock\n   - Their recent success with scissors might influence them\n   - But three scissors in a row would be very bold\n\n[move] rock Since they've had recent success with scissors and might try it again after the tie (thinking I'll switch to paper), I'll play rock to counter their potential third scissors play. While three scissors in a row is bold, their recent success with it makes it more likely.\n",
        "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent sequence:\n   - They won with scissors against my rock\n   - Then we tied with scissors-scissors\n   - Shows we both predicted aggressive play\n   - Game has shifted to mutual prediction\n\n2. Tie situation analysis:\n   - First tie in several rounds\n   - Both chose aggressive move (scissors)\n   - Shows similar thinking patterns\n   - Breaks the decisive streak\n\n3. Common behavior after scissors-scissors tie:\n   - Players often switch to rock (safest counter)\n   - Some stick with scissors (testing nerve)\n   - Few choose paper (highest risk)\n   - Most try to break the symmetry\n\n4. Their likely reasoning:\n   - \"We both thought alike with scissors\"\n   - \"They might expect me to switch to rock\"\n   - \"Could they predict my counter to their counter?\"\n   - \"Need to break this mind-reading cycle\"\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie:\n     * Rock is obvious counter (too obvious?)\n     * Staying with scissors is risky\n     * Paper would be unexpected\n   - They might:\n     * Think I'll play rock to counter scissors\n     * Consider I might expect that and play paper\n     * Try to be one step ahead\n\n[move] paper Since they might expect me to play rock to counter our mutual scissors, and they've shown capacity for higher-level thinking, I predict they'll use paper to counter my expected rock.

Pattern analysis:\n   - They've used scissors twice in a row\n   - First time got them a win\n   - Second time led to a tie\n   - Momentum is neutral after tie\n\n3. Psychological factors after a tie:\n   - Both players know we read each other correctly\n   - Creates pressure to \"win\" the tie\n   - Players often try to outsmart the mirror\n   - Scissors-scissors tie often leads to rock plays\n\n4. Their likely thought process:\n   - \"Scissors worked then tied\"\n   - \"They finally predicted my scissors\"\n   - \"They might expect me to switch\"\n   - \"Need to break this mirror effect\"\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie:\n     * Triple scissors would be very bold\n     * Many players switch to rock (safe option)\n     * Some try to be clever with paper\n   - Common responses to ties:\n     * Try to counter predicted move\n     * Make \"safe\" plays\n     * Break pattern completely\n\n[move] paper Since we just tied with scissors and they might expect me to play rock to counter their potential scissors, I predict they'll use rock as a safe option, thinking I'll try to counter their previous scissors.
