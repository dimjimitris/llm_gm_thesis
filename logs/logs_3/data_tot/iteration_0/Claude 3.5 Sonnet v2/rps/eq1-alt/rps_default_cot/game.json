Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's latest moves: paper\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\n   - They've changed strategy after my scissors prediction worked\n   - They tried to counter scissors with rock, but it backfired\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - They just lost for the first time\n   - Players often change strategy after losing\n   - They might be more cautious after scissors beat their rock\n   - They might try to regain control with a safe move\n\n4. Strategic thinking:\n   - They've seen scissors from me three times now\n   - They'll likely expect me to be confident with scissors after winning\n   - They might play rock again to beat expected scissors\n   - Or they might return to their successful paper strategy\n\n5. Decision:\n   - They're most likely to play rock to counter my recent scissors success\n   - Paper would be the optimal counter to their likely rock\n   - Even if they return to paper, I only tie\n   - This is a safer play than continuing with scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"
