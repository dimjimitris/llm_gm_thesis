Critical Rule Clarification:\n   - My previous wins/losses confirm:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not the typical rule)\n   - Rock loses to scissors (not the typical rule)\n   - This is an INVERSE Rock-Paper-Scissors game!\n   - The normal relationships are reversed\n\n3.

Strategic considerations:\n   - They just lost with scissors\n   - Given inverse rules:\n     * If they switch to rock, paper loses\n     * If they stick with scissors, paper wins\n     * If they switch to paper, paper ties\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They've shown persistence with scissors\n   - I've just won with paper against scissors\n   - Even knowing inverse rules, they might stick to scissors\n   - Paper has been successful and safer than rock\n   - Given their pattern and the inverse rules:\n   \n[move] paper\n"

Confirmed Inverse Rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (confirmed multiple times)\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - This is consistent across recent rounds\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation:\n   - Each move can win against one option and lose against another\n   - The game is perfectly balanced\n   - Without prior information, no move has inherent advantage\n\n4. For the first move:\n   - Rock is often a common initial choice for many players\n   - It's seen as a \"strong\" or \"safe\" opening move psychologically\n   - If opponent plays rock, we tie (0)\n   - If opponent plays paper, we lose (-1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, we win (+1)\n\n5. Since this is a fresh start, I'll choose rock as it's a balanced opening move that can help establish a baseline for future rounds.\n\n[move] rock Opening with a solid choice to test the waters\n",

Since there's no strategic advantage to any particular move in the first round, I'll make a random choice while being ready to adapt my strategy based on the opponent's response.\n\n5.

Pattern observation:\n   - Game has stabilized somewhat:\n     * I won after a losing streak\n     * Then got a tie\n   - They switched from rock to paper\n   - They've shown they can alternate between predictable and unpredictable patterns\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - The tie creates a neutral situation\n   - Both players likely want to break the tie\n   - They've shown they're skilled at mind games\n   - They might expect me to overthink this situation\n\n4. Strategic considerations (inverse rules):\n   - After a paper-paper tie:\n     * Most would play scissors to beat paper\n     * But they might expect this and play rock\n     * Or they might stick with paper expecting me to overthink\n   - They've shown they can think multiple moves ahead\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their sophisticated play style\n   - And their ability to counter obvious moves\n   - They're likely to play rock:\n     * It beats the obvious scissors choice\n     * It's a strong counter to expected counter-play\n   - Therefore, scissors is best:\n     * Beats their likely rock play\n     * Beats paper if they stay\n     * Only loses to paper if they double-counter\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Pattern observation:\n   - Their sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They abandoned rock after losing with it\n   - The tie breaks both players' win-loss pattern\n   - Game has reset to neutral position with tie\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - After a tie, most players change moves\n   - They've shown ability to play both patterns and anti-patterns\n   - They might expect me to follow conventional \"switch after tie\" wisdom\n   - They've been successful by being unpredictable\n\n4. Strategic considerations (inverse rules):\n   - After paper-paper tie:\n     * Most players would switch to scissors\n     * But they often do unexpected moves\n     * If they expect me to play scissors, they might play paper\n     * If they expect me to overthink, they might play scissors\n\n5.
