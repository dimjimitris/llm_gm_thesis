    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward trade-offs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. No single move dominates others.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we can't predict the opponent's likely move based on patterns. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we have no information about the opponent, we should avoid any high-risk strategies. Each move has equal expected value mathematically. However, if the opponent indeed tends to choose rock first as the Pattern Analyzer suggests, paper would give us a slight edge.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. While all moves are theoretically equal, there's a slight psychological advantage to playing paper first, as it counters the common opening move of rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our discussion, let's go with paper for our first move. It has equal mathematical expectation as other moves but might have a slight psychological advantage against common opening strategies.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They might stick to paper, thinking we'll switch to scissors\n\nGame Strategist: When an opponent mirrors your move, it could indicate they're either:\n- Playing defensively (trying to force ties)\n- Using a similar strategic thinking process\n- Or preparing to counter our next expected move\n\nRisk Manager: Since they matched our paper move, they might expect us to either:\n- Stick with paper (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n- Switch to scissors (to beat their paper)\n- Switch to rock (thinking they'll switch to scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, rock would be a strong play here. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to scissors (expecting our paper), we win\n2. If they switch to rock (playing safe), we tie\n3. If they stick to paper, we lose, but this is less likely as it would be predictable\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the Game Strategist's analysis.

So far we've seen:\nRound 1: Both played paper\nRound 2: Both played rock\nThe opponent has mirrored our moves exactly, which could be:\n1. A coincidence\n2. A deliberate mirroring strategy\n3. Similar strategic thinking patterns\n\nGame Strategist: The consistent mirroring suggests they might be:\n- Using a similar analytical approach\n- Deliberately copying our moves (though they can't know our move before making theirs)\n- Or we're both following common game patterns\n\nRisk Manager: Given the mirroring pattern, we have several considerations:\n1. If they're truly mirroring through similar logic, they might make the same choice as us again\n2. If they're aware of the pattern, they might try to break it\n3. The most logical progression from rock would be scissors, as players often cycle through the options\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at common RPS patterns, after rock, many players instinctively choose scissors to complete the natural \"rock-paper-scissors\" sequence. However, if our opponent is thinking the same way, they might choose paper to beat our expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, paper would be our strongest move because:\n1. If they choose scissors (following the natural sequence), we lose\n2. If they choose paper (mirroring continues), we tie\n3. If they choose rock (trying to beat our expected scissors), we win\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the Game Strategist. Let's play paper.

Either the opponent is:\n1. Using extremely similar decision-making logic\n2. Following a sophisticated mirroring algorithm\n3. Somehow predicting our moves\n\nGame Strategist: This is a classic game theory situation. When an opponent perfectly mirrors your moves, the standard approach would be to try breaking the pattern. However, we need to consider that:\n1. The opponent might anticipate we'll try to break the pattern\n2. They might break their mirroring strategy at the same time\n3. The mirroring might not be intentional but rather parallel thinking\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical decision point:\n- Continuing with the logical sequence would suggest scissors\n- Breaking the pattern entirely would suggest rock\n- The opponent might expect us to break the pattern and adjust accordingly\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure to break the pattern is high after three consecutive ties. This might influence both players to make a dramatic change. However, if both players make this same assumption, we could end up mirroring again.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. It follows the natural progression from paper\n2. If they're mirroring through similar logic, they'll likely choose scissors too\n3. If they try to break the pattern with rock, we lose, but if they break it with paper, we win\n4. The probability of four consecutive mirrors decreases with each round\n\nAI Assistant (me): After considering all perspectives, I agree with choosing scissors. While the mirroring pattern is strong, scissors is both a natural progression and a reasonable choice whether the opponent continues mirroring or tries to break the pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This strongly suggests we're either:\n1. Playing against an AI that's using similar logic\n2. Facing a player who has perfectly synchronized decision-making patterns\n3. Dealing with a direct mirroring algorithm\n\nGame Strategist: This is a fascinating case of either:\n- Perfect strategic alignment\n- An opponent who has cracked our decision-making process\n- Or an extremely improbable series of coincidences\n\nThe probability of random matching for 4 consecutive rounds is (1/3)^4 = 1/81, making this almost certainly systematic.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this pattern:\n1. Breaking the pattern now seems mandatory - continuing the logical progression feels too predictable\n2. But the opponent might also reach this same conclusion\n3. We need to think about what move would be least expected\n\nPattern Analyzer: After scissors, the typical progression would be rock. However, given the perfect mirroring and the mounting pressure to break the pattern, both players are likely thinking about making an unexpected move.\n\nGame Strategist: In this scenario, paper would be our best move because:\n1. It's the least expected move after scissors\n2. If they follow the natural progression to rock, we win\n3. If they try to be unpredictable and choose scissors, we lose\n4. If they mirror us again (which has been consistent), we tie\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing paper.

The opponent returns to mirroring after each pattern break\n2. The score remains tied\n3. We've seen three separate mirroring sequences\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's behavior suggests:\n1. They default to mirroring as a base strategy\n2. They make calculated breaks from mirroring to win\n3. They might be waiting for us to make a predictable move\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n1. Scores are even\n2. We're back in a mirroring pattern\n3. Both players have proven they can win when breaking patterns\n4. The next pattern break could be decisive\n\nPattern Analyzer: After mutual scissors, the considerations are:\n1. Rock is the conventional counter to scissors\n2. Many players would avoid rock as too obvious\n3. Paper might be used to counter the expected rock\n4. Staying with scissors could catch an overthinking opponent\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. It's the least conventional move after scissors\n2. It beats rock, which is the most logical next move\n3. If they mirror us again, we tie\n4. If they play scissors again, we lose, but they might avoid repeating scissors three times\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing paper. While it's unconventional after scissors, this might be exactly what we need against an opponent who has shown both sophisticated pattern recognition and a tendency to mirror our moves. It's a calculated risk that could give us an advantage if they play the more conventional rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We have momentum after two consecutive wins, and rock is a strong play that could give us another win if they stick with scissors or try to reestablish control. While it risks losing to paper, it's a calculated aggressive move that maintains our momentum while not being overly complex in our strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We need to take calculated risks to overcome their lead\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing scissors. While it's unconventional after rock, we need to break their return to mirroring and can't afford to play it safe. If they make the conventional play of paper after rock, we win. While it risks losing to rock, we need to take calculated risks to overcome the one-point deficit, and scissors represents our best chance to catch them being predictable.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
