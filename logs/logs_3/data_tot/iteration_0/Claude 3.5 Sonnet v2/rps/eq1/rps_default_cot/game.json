Tie with scissors\n\nThey seem to alternate between:\n- Perfect mirroring phases\n- Strategic prediction phases\n- Pattern-breaking moments\n\nAfter a tie with scissors, common strategies are:\n1. Stay with scissors (stubborn)\n2. Switch to rock (counter scissors)\n3. Switch to paper (complete the cycle)\n\n[move] rock\nI'm choosing rock because:\n- If they stick with scissors (some players do after a tie), I win\n- If they expect me to go paper (completing the cycle), their likely scissors counter would lose to my rock\n- If they mirror again, a tie is acceptable\n- This move provides good coverage against multiple potential strategies\n"
