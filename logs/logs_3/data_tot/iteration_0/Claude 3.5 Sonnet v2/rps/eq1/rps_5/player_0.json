    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any historical data, each move has equal theoretical probability of success:\n   * Rock: 33.3% win, 33.3% lose, 33.3% tie\n   * Paper: 33.3% win, 33.3% lose, 33.3% tie\n   * Scissors: 33.3% win, 33.3% lose, 33.3% tie\n\n4. A common opening move in RPS is rock, as many players instinctively choose it first due to its perceived strength.\n\n5. If I anticipate they might play rock, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper as it could give me an advantage if the opponent plays the common opening move of rock.\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as my opening move, anticipating a possible rock play from a new opponent.\n"

            "text": "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Complete game history analysis:\n   * Recent sequence:\n      - Round 18: Both scissors (tie)\n      - Round 19: My rock vs their paper (lost)\n      - Round 20: Both rock (tie)\n      - Round 21: My rock vs their scissors (won)\n   * Overall record: 8 wins, 6 losses, 7 ties\n   * I'm slightly ahead again\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * My last two moves were both rock:\n      - First resulted in tie\n      - Second resulted in win\n   * They switched from rock to scissors\n   * They might think I'm falling into a rock pattern\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They just lost to my repeated rock play\n   * They might view my double rock as:\n      - Growing predictable\n      - Getting overconfident\n      - Settling into a pattern\n   * End game is approaching (21 rounds played)\n\n4. Their likely strategy:\n   * After losing to rock, they probably will:\n      - Not play scissors again\n      - Likely play paper to beat expected rock\n      - Less likely to play rock defensively\n   * They've shown they adjust well after losses\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   * If they expect third rock: they'll play paper\n   * If they think I'll switch: they might play rock\n   * If they're playing mind games: could still play scissors\n   * Most likely scenarios:\n      - They expect another rock and play paper\n      - They expect me to know this and play scissors\n      - They play defensively with rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors. While they might expect me to play rock a third time (and counter with paper), the more sophisticated play would be to expect me to switch to paper to beat their potential rock. Scissors beats both paper scenarios while accepting the risk of their defensive rock play.\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors, breaking my rock pattern while anticipating their paper counter to my expected rock play.\n"

Psychological factors:\n   * I'm on a two-win streak\n   * They've lost two in a row\n   * They might be feeling pressure as game nears end\n   * Their paper play was predictable (trying to beat expected rock)\n\n4.

Strategic calculation:\n   * After losing to scissors, typical responses are:\n      - Play rock (defensive against scissors)\n      - Play scissors (aggressive new approach)\n      - Stay with paper (unlikely after loss)\n   * Given their recent losses:\n      - They likely won't play paper again\n      - Rock is their most logical move\n      - Scissors would be their most aggressive option\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. After losing to scissors, they're most likely to play rock either as a defensive move or to counter my potential scissors repeat.
