    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Decision Maker (myself) - For making final move decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In rock-paper-scissors, when playing against a fresh opponent with no historical data, game theory suggests that the optimal strategy is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move. This prevents being exploited by any pattern.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no prior information about the opponent's tendencies, I agree that we shouldn't show any bias in our initial move. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move, but we shouldn't base our strategy on this unverified assumption.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with both perspectives. Without any prior information, we should avoid being predictable. Let's start with paper, which would win against a potential rock-first player but is also a perfectly valid random choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper seems reasonable. Remember that we should be ready to adapt our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

While this could be a pattern (the common \"rock-first\" strategy), they might switch tactics after losing.\n\nGame Strategist: Having won with paper, there are a few psychological factors to consider:\n1. The opponent might expect us to stick with paper since it worked\n2. They might switch to scissors to counter our previous paper\n3. They might stay with rock, thinking we'll assume points 1 or 2\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that many players tend to switch their move after losing, there's a higher probability they'll choose scissors to counter our previous paper.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, we should consider playing rock to counter their potential scissors. However, we should remain unpredictable to avoid being exploited.\n\nDecision Maker: The analysis suggests our opponent is likely to switch to scissors. While maintaining some randomness is important, in this case the psychological factors are strong enough to warrant playing rock as a counter-strategy.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. Rock would protect against the likely scissors play while still being a reasonable choice if we're wrong.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they play scissors as predicted, our best move would be rock.\n\nDecision Maker: The rotation pattern seems strong enough to act on. Even if we're wrong, rock is still a reasonable choice that keeps us unpredictable while having good chances of success.

If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next. However, we should consider:\n1. They might realize we've caught onto their pattern and change strategy\n2. They might continue the pattern thinking we won't expect them to be so predictable\n3. They just lost, which might influence their next decision\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their adherence to the pattern even after both winning and losing suggests it might be their core strategy. However, three rounds is often enough for players to recognize they're being predictable.\n\nGame Strategist: If they continue the pattern, they'll play rock. In that case, paper would be our best move. Even if they break the pattern, paper is not a bad choice as it hasn't been our most recent move.\n\nDecision Maker: The evidence for the rotation pattern is strong, and paper gives us the best expected value here.

The opponent broke their rotation pattern (which would have been rock) and played paper instead. This suggests:\n1. They may have abandoned their previous pattern completely\n2. They might have delayed their pattern by one move\n3. They could be mirroring our last move (we played rock, they played paper)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The tie result might influence their next move. Players often change their move after a tie, as they seek a decisive result.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, we should consider:\n- If they've abandoned their pattern, we need a new strategy\n- If they're mirroring our moves, they might play paper again\n- Most players tend to change moves after a tie\n\nDecision Maker: Since there's no clear pattern anymore, and players typically change their move after a tie, we should play scissors.

We've fallen into the trap of trying to find patterns that might not exist. In such cases, game theory suggests returning to the basic optimal strategy: random selection with equal probability.\n\nDecision Maker: I agree. We're at risk of over-analyzing and becoming predictable ourselves.

This creates an interesting psychological situation:\n1. After two ties, both players typically have a strong urge to change moves\n2. This creates a mind game where each player tries to predict if the other will change\n3. The opponent might expect us to switch to scissors to beat their paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent has shown they're skilled at predicting our moves. They might:\n1. Switch to scissors, expecting us to play paper again\n2. Switch to rock, anticipating we'll switch to scissors\n3. Keep paper, thinking we'll overthink the situation\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, when both players are likely thinking multiple levels deep about predictions, game theory again suggests avoiding patterns. However, given the recent ties, rock would be a strong play because:\n1. It beats scissors if they try to counter our paper\n2. It ties with rock if they try to counter our potential scissors\n3. Only loses to paper, which would be a bold move after two paper ties\n\nDecision Maker: I agree with playing rock. The psychological pressure to change moves after two ties is strong, and rock positions us well against the most likely responses.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

However, avoiding scissors just because it's obvious could be overthinking again.\n\nDecision Maker: In this case, we need to make the straightforward play.
