    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when facing an unknown opponent in Rock Paper Scissors, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying. No single move has an inherent advantage.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, there are some psychological studies that suggest many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move, as it represents strength and stability.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could:\n1. Play 'paper' to beat the common 'rock' first move\n2. Play 'rock' ourselves for a likely tie scenario\n3. Play 'scissors' as an unexpected opener\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we go with paper. It beats the psychologically favored first move (rock), and if we're wrong, we only risk losing to scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Paper is also a good opening move because it will help us establish a baseline for the opponent's strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for paper seems optimal here. Let's proceed with that choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Choosing paper as an opening move, anticipating a possible 'rock' first move from a new player.\n"

Now, let's consider their likely response:\n1. They might stick with rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. They might switch to paper to counter our previous paper\n3. Most likely, they'll switch to scissors to counter our paper\n\nGame Strategist: After losing to paper, many players will try to counter the previous winning move. The opponent is likely to expect us to use paper again, so they'll probably choose scissors to counter it.\n\nRisk Manager: If we believe they'll switch to scissors, our optimal move would be rock. However, we should also consider the possibility that they might be thinking multiple levels ahead and choose paper expecting our rock.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I still recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats the most likely move (scissors)\n2. If they stick to rock, it's a tie (minimal loss)\n3. We only lose if they make the sophisticated play of switching to paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. At this early stage, most players tend to make direct counters rather than thinking multiple levels ahead. Rock is our best option.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward profile of choosing rock looks good. Even in the worst case (opponent chooses paper), we only lose 1 point while still maintaining a positive overall score from our first win.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Anticipating opponent will switch to scissors to counter our previous paper play\n"

They've used it twice now, showing a preference\n2. The last round was a tie, which might reinforce their choice\n3. Rock is psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" move\n\nRisk Manager: Their behavior suggests risk-averse play.

Paper is the strongest play here.

Let's review:\nRound 1: They played rock (we won with paper)\nRound 2: They played rock (tie)\nRound 3: They played rock (we won with paper)\n\nThe opponent has played rock THREE times in a row, losing twice to our paper. This is a remarkably consistent pattern suggesting either:\n1. A very stubborn player\n2. A programmed bot with a fixed strategy\n3. An extremely conservative player\n\nGame Strategist: However, we need to be cautious here. Even the most stubborn player or basic bot might change strategy after losing twice with the same move. This could be the breaking point where they finally switch.\n\nRisk Manager: Let's assess our options:\n1. Paper again: Wins if they stick to rock, but loses to very likely scissors counter\n2. Rock: Ties if they stick to rock, wins if they switch to scissors\n3. Scissors: Wins if they switch to paper, loses to rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: While the pattern strongly suggests rock again, this many losses might finally trigger a change. After multiple losses to paper, scissors is the most logical counter they would choose.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock this time. Here's why:\n- It protects against scissors (their most logical counter to our paper success)\n- It ties against rock if they remain stubborn\n- Only loses to paper, which would require them to think multiple steps ahead\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

They might be thinking one move at a time, rather than long-term strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Now that they've shown ability to switch, we need to consider their likely next move.

Stick with scissors hoping we won't expect it twice\n\nRisk Manager: In this situation, playing rock again offers several advantages:\n1. Beats scissors if they stick with it\n2.

They've lost repeatedly by being predictable. Their most logical move now would be paper, as it's the only move they haven't tried and it would beat our successful rock play.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed with Game Strategist.

Consider rock, which would tie against their comfort move or beat their scissors\n\nRisk Manager: Rock offers the best risk-reward profile:\n- Ties if they stick with rock (likely given their history)\n- Beats scissors if they try to get clever\n- Only loses to paper, which they've shown less preference for\n- Safe play to maintain our point lead\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing conservatively after their successful prediction, anticipating either continued rock play or attempted scissors counter\n"

They've won two consecutive rounds\n2. They're showing higher-level strategic thinking\n3. They're successfully predicting and countering our moves\n4. We've lost 2 points in 2 rounds\n\nGame Strategist: Their gameplay has evolved significantly:\n1. Successfully broke tie pattern\n2. Accurately predicting our defensive adjustment\n3. Using our tendencies against us\n4. Showing sophisticated multi-level thinking\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n- Lead reduced to 9 points\n- Opponent has momentum\n- They're reading our strategy successfully\n- Need to stop their winning streak\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior:\n1. They've progressed from rock \u2192 paper\n2. They're playing proactively rather than reactively\n3. They might expect us to play scissors to counter their paper\n\nGame Strategist: To break their momentum, we need to:\n1. Avoid being predictable with scissors counter\n2. Consider they might expect us to avoid being predictable\n3. Sometimes the obvious play is best when opponent expects complexity\n\nRisk Manager: I suggest paper because:\n1. If they expect us to play scissors and use rock, paper wins\n2. If they continue their forward momentum with scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they overthink and stay with paper, we tie and stop their momentum\n4. Most opponents don't expect the same move that just beat them\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Making the unexpected \"obvious\" play, anticipating opponent will overthink and try to counter scissors\n"

Successfully stopped their winning streak with the tie\n2. They're showing high-level prediction ability\n3. Pattern has become complex and psychological\n4. They matched our \"unexpected obvious\" play\n\nGame Strategist: This situation shows:\n1. Both players are now thinking multiple levels deep\n2. Simple patterns are being avoided by both sides\n3. It's becoming a mind game of prediction and counter-prediction\n4. Each move requires considering opponent's thought process\n\nRisk Manager: Current considerations:\n- 9 point lead remains stable\n- Momentum has been neutralized with tie\n- Need to stay unpredictable\n- Can't rely on pattern analysis as much\n\nPattern Analyzer: After this tie, they might:\n1. Expect us to switch to scissors (logical next move)\n2. Play rock to counter our expected scissors\n3. Or expect us to predict that and stay with paper\n4. The levels of prediction have become very complex\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, the strongest play might be scissors because:\n1. It's the straightforward play after paper-paper\n2. They might overthink and expect us to avoid it\n3. Sometimes the obvious play works best when both players are overthinking\n\nRisk Manager: I disagree. With both players showing sophisticated strategy, rock would be better:\n1. Beats scissors if they make the \"obvious\" play\n2. Safe against their potential rock play if they mirror our last game\n3. Only loses to paper, which they might avoid after just using it\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed with Risk Manager. When both players are showing high-level thinking, breaking down to a simpler, safer strategy can be effective.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Taking a strong defensive position while both players are engaged in complex strategic thinking\n"
