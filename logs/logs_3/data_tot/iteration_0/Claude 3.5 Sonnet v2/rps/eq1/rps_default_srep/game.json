After losing to scissors, they're likely to play scissors themselves to counter my expected paper\n2. They've lost repeatedly to scissors, making them likely to use scissors offensively\n3. If they play paper again, I'll lose, but they've been punished multiple times for paper plays\n4. Rock is a strong defensive play that capitalizes on their likely psychological state\n"
