    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

AI Assistant (me) - For coordinating and making final decisions\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a fresh game against a new player, there's no prior history to analyze. From a game theory perspective, all three moves have equal expected value in a single isolated round. However, 'rock' is often a common first move choice among new players due to its perceived \"strength.\"\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move because it feels more \"solid\" and \"defensive.\" This psychological tendency could be exploited.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Given this insight, 'paper' would be a good counter to the expected 'rock' move. Even if we're wrong, the worst case is either a tie (if they also choose paper) or a single point loss (if they choose scissors).\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Since this is a fresh game and many players tend to choose 'rock' first, I'll go with paper to potentially counter this common opening move.\n\n[move] paper Opening with paper to counter the common 'rock' first move strategy.\n"

In any case, we now have one data point about their behavior - they used scissors in round 1.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who win their first round often feel confident and might be tempted to repeat their successful move. However, they might also anticipate that we'll try to counter their previous move, leading to a mind game situation.\n\nStrategic Advisor: We have two main options here:\n1. If they repeat scissors (due to first success), we should play rock\n2. If they anticipate us countering with rock and switch to paper, we should play scissors\n\nHowever, the safer play here might be rock since:\n- It beats their previous move (scissors)\n- Even if they switch to paper, we only lose one point\n- Many players don't use the same move twice in a row after a win\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with the Strategic Advisor.

They've used 2 different moves so far, notably not using paper yet.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie in the previous round creates an interesting psychological state. After a tie, players often feel compelled to \"break\" the deadlock by changing their move. Also, they haven't used paper yet, and might feel it's \"due\" to be used.\n\nStrategic Advisor: Consider these factors:\n1. They might expect us to continue the \"one step behind\" pattern and use paper to beat their rock\n2. They haven't used paper yet and might choose it\n3.
