    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Probability Expert - For calculating optimal mixed strategies\n4. Psychology Expert - For understanding human behavior in game situations\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In Rock Paper Scissors, against a fresh opponent with no prior history, game theory suggests using a mixed strategy. No pure strategy (always choosing one move) is optimal because it can be exploited.\n\nPsychology Expert: When people first play RPS, they often choose Rock as their first move. It's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. However, this is just a tendency, not a certainty.\n\nProbability Expert: In a one-shot game with no prior information, each move should theoretically have an equal 1/3 probability of being chosen for optimal play.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze. We should focus on making an unpredictable first move.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should make a move that has reasonable chances against the common first-move tendency (Rock) while still being strategically sound against other possibilities.\n\nPsychology Expert: I suggest Paper as our first move. It beats the psychologically favored Rock opening, and if we're wrong, we only lose to Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with Paper for the first move. We can then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Making an educated first move based on common opening tendencies while maintaining a strategically sound position.\n"

Stick to Rock (some players are stubborn)\n2. Try to counter our Paper with Scissors (a common adaptation)\n3. Make a completely different choice to be unpredictable\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing, players often shift their strategy. Having lost to Paper, there's a strong psychological tendency to switch to Scissors to counter what we just played. This is because players often assume their opponent will repeat a winning move.\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent has shown a conventional/traditional approach by opening with Rock. This might indicate a somewhat predictable player who follows common patterns. Given they lost, they're likely to adjust their strategy.\n\nProbability Expert: While all moves remain theoretically equal in probability, the psychological factors and our opponent's demonstrated traditional play style skew the likelihood toward them choosing Scissors as a counter-strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they expect us to play Paper again (which we won't), they'll play Scissors. If they think we'll predict Scissors and play Rock, they might play Paper. This is getting into higher-level mind games.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should play Rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats the most likely counter-move (Scissors)\n2. If they stick to their original Rock, we tie\n3. We only lose to Paper, which is less likely given the psychological tendency to counter the previous winning move\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Rock is the optimal play here based on the psychological profile we're building of our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating opponent's likely adjustment to counter our previous winning Paper move\n"

Two common reactions:\n1. They might try to break their losing streak by using what just beat them (Rock)\n2. They might try to be unpredictable by using what hasn't been played recently (Paper)\n\nGame Strategist: Our opponent has demonstrated:\n- Traditional opening with Rock\n- Predictable counter-play attempts\n- No successful adaptations yet\nGiven their likely frustration after two losses, they're more likely to try something completely different.\n\nProbability Expert: Looking at unused moves, Paper hasn't been played by them yet. There's a heightened probability they'll use it now, especially since it:\n1. Hasn't been used by them\n2. Would beat our last winning move (Rock)\n3. Breaks their current predictable pattern\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with the probability analysis. They're likely to play Paper to:\n- Counter our Rock\n- Use their unused move\n- Break their losing streak\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should play Scissors. It will:\n1.

In such situations, players often:\n1. Revert to their \"comfort move\" (which was Rock for this player)\n2. Try to be completely random/unpredictable\n3. Attempt to break their pattern by doing something unexpected\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. The opponent has now tried all three moves and lost with each. They might:\n- Realize we're reading their pattern and try to break it\n- Be too frustrated to think strategically and revert to their opening move\n- Try to double-think us by anticipating our anticipation\n\nProbability Expert: Given our perfect read so far, the opponent is likely to:\n1. Either abandon their pattern completely (high probability)\n2. Or revert to Rock (their initial comfort move) out of frustration (moderate probability)\nPaper would be their most recent losing move, making it least likely.\n\nPsychology Expert: In high-pressure situations after multiple losses, players often revert to their initial strategies. I strongly believe they'll go back to Rock, their opening move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The psychological pressure of three losses makes strategic thinking difficult. They're likely to revert to their \"comfort move\" of Rock, which also fits with trying to beat our last move (Scissors).\n\nPattern Analyst: The convergence of these factors - psychology of losing, comfort moves, and attempt to counter Scissors - all point to Rock.\n\nAll Personas: Recommend Paper to counter the likely Rock play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating opponent's reversion to their opening move (Rock) under pressure of three consecutive losses\n"

This is a crucial psychological moment where players typically either:\n1. Completely break down and make irrational choices\n2. Finally step back and try to completely change their approach\n3. Become desperate and aggressive (often manifesting as Scissors in RPS)\n\nGame Strategist: This is a pivotal round. The opponent has likely realized that:\n- Their patterns are being read perfectly\n- Standard strategies aren't working\n- They need to do something drastically different\n\nProbability Expert: In states of extreme frustration, players tend to favor aggressive moves. Scissors is often perceived as the most aggressive move, making it highly probable as a desperate attempt to break the losing streak.\n\nPattern Analyst: Important observation: They've now shown a tendency to revert to Rock under pressure, but they must realize this pattern too. They're likely to deliberately avoid Rock this time.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree about the likelihood of Scissors. In RPS psychology, Scissors is often chosen when players want to \"cut through\" their problems. The aggressive nature of Scissors appeals to frustrated players.\n\nGame Strategist: The convergence of:\n- Psychological state (extreme frustration)\n- Need for aggressive action\n- Desire to break patterns\nAll point to Scissors as their most likely move.\n\nAll Personas: Recommend Rock to counter the anticipated Scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating an aggressive Scissors play from an opponent seeking to break their losing streak through forceful action\n"

After multiple losses, they finally managed to win. This will significantly boost their confidence. Players who just broke a losing streak often:\n1. Feel validated in their last successful strategy\n2. Consider repeating the winning move\n3. Feel less pressured and think more clearly\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial turning point. Their successful Paper play might encourage them to:\n- Stick with Paper (thinking we might expect them to change)\n- Switch to Scissors (to counter our potential Paper counter)\n- Play Rock (attempting to be unpredictable)\n\nProbability Expert: Given their first success came with Paper, and considering the psychological boost, there's a significant probability they'll stick with Paper. Winners often repeat winning moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: However, they've also shown they can adapt. The fact that they broke their pattern successfully might encourage them to try another unexpected move.\n\nPsychology Expert: When players finally succeed after multiple failures, they often stick with what worked. The relief and confidence from breaking their losing streak makes Paper a highly likely choice.\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. Now that they've shown they can think ahead and break patterns, they're more likely to anticipate our counter to Paper. I believe they'll play Scissors to counter our expected Paper play.\n\nPattern Analyst: The Game Strategist makes a compelling point. Their successful pattern break suggests higher-level thinking. Scissors would be a smart play from their perspective.\n\nAll Personas: After debate, we recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats the Scissors they might play expecting us to play Paper\n2.

It suggests they're playing more cautiously and thoughtfully now.

Reset the game mentally\n2. Test our reaction to a tie\n3. Return to basics after the complexity of previous rounds\n\nProbability Expert: After a tie, players often try to gain advantage by switching to Paper, thinking their opponent will repeat Rock. However, this opponent has shown they can think beyond basic patterns.\n\nPattern Analyst: We've seen this opponent evolve from:\n- Predictable counter-plays\n- To successful pattern breaking\n- To cautious play (the Rock tie)\nThis suggests they're becoming more sophisticated in their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their evolution, they're likely thinking several moves ahead now.

Our predictive strategy that worked early is now failing\n2. The opponent has significantly outplayed us in recent rounds\n3. They've shown mastery of both tactical and psychological aspects\n\nProbability Expert: In situations of sustained losing streaks, returning to pure game theory is crucial. Each move should still have a 1/3 probability of success, regardless of past outcomes.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their recent success with Scissors suggests comfort with aggressive plays, but they've demonstrated they can use any move effectively.\n\nPsychology Expert: In their position, with four straight wins, they might:\n1. Feel extremely confident and aggressive\n2. Try to finish strong with their recently successful Scissors\n3. Anticipate our desperation and plan accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated sophistication, complex predictions are more likely to fail. We need a fundamentally sound play that gives us the best chance regardless of their choice.\n\nAll Personas: After thorough analysis, we recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. It beats Scissors if they maintain aggressive play\n2. It's a strong defensive move when under pressure\n3. We need to break their momentum with a simple, solid play\n4. Overthinking has been working against us - time for a direct approach\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed.
