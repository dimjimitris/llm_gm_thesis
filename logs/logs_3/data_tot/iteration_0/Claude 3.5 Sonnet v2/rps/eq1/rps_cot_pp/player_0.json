    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete game history analysis:\n   - Round 20: scissors vs rock (lost)\n   - Round 21: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: rock vs scissors (won)\n   - Round 23: scissors vs rock (lost)\n   - Score back to 0\n   - CRITICAL INSIGHT: Scissors has consistently lost to their rock\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - Their last four moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Every time I play scissors, they seem ready with rock\n   - This is a clear, repeated pattern throughout the game\n   - They have consistently punished my scissors plays\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - They've mastered countering my scissors plays\n   - I've become too predictable with scissors attempts\n   - They seem to read my scissors strategy perfectly\n   - My scissors plays are now a liability\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Must absolutely avoid scissors as it consistently loses\n   - They might:\n     a) Stay with successful rock strategy\n     b) Expect paper to counter their rock\n     c) Try to get ahead of my adjustment\n   - Need to break my losing pattern\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Scissors has failed repeatedly - must avoid\n   - They're likely to stay with rock given their success\n   - Paper would:\n     a) Counter their likely rock play\n     b) Break my losing scissors pattern\n     c) Force them to adapt to a new strategy\n     d) Take advantage of their confidence in rock\n\n[move] paper (Breaking scissors pattern and countering their successful rock strategy)\n"
