    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, psychology research suggests that rock is often the most common first move people make\n6. Given this, paper would be a good counter to the most likely first move\n7. Even if they don't choose rock:\n   - If they choose scissors, I lose (-1 point)\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose rock, I win (+1 point)\n8.

The most sophisticated play would be to switch to scissors:\n   - It beats the previous move (paper)\n   - It shows strategic progression\n   - Many players avoid repeating the same move after a tie\n\n5. Therefore, I should choose rock to counter the likely scissors play\n\nFinal decision: Rock seems the most strategic choice\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, considering player psychology:\n   - Two ties in a row creates pressure to break the pattern\n   - Players often try to outsmart each other after multiple ties\n   - The opponent might expect me to choose scissors following the pattern\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might choose rock\n   - If they try to be extra clever and choose paper to beat expected rock\n   - The safest play would be scissors, as it:\n     * Beats paper if they try to beat expected rock\n     * Follows the natural pattern (making it less suspicious)\n     * Creates an unexpected consistency in strategy\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors, as it balances pattern continuation with strategic advantage\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent history:\n   - Lost scissors vs rock\n   - Lost paper vs scissors\n   - Lost rock vs paper\n   - On a concerning 3-loss streak\n   - Opponent perfectly countering each move\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent showing mastery:\n     * Adapting to each situation\n     * Staying ahead of my strategy\n     * Successfully mixing defensive/aggressive plays\n     * Reading my attempts at strategic adjustment\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - During a 3-loss streak:\n     * Traditional strategy is failing\n     * Opponent has psychological advantage\n     * Risk of making frustrated decisions\n     * Need to break their momentum\n     * Must avoid predictable responses\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've won with:\n     * Rock against scissors\n     * Scissors against paper\n     * Paper against rock\n   - They're executing perfect counters\n   - They seem to be reading my logical progressions\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - When opponent shows perfect reading:\n     * Complex strategy isn't working\n     * Need true randomness\n     * Break any remaining patterns\n     * Scissors would:\n        - Be least expected after losing to paper\n        - Skip obvious rock counter\n        - Show willingness to be unpredictable\n        - Force them to prove they can read random play\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors - deliberately avoiding logical progression and introducing true randomness to break their perfect reading\n\n[move] scissors\n"
