Strategic calculation:\n   * They're most likely to:\n      - Play scissors to beat my potential paper repeat\n      - Play paper to beat my potential return to rock\n      - Avoid rock as it just lost\n   * Their mindset is likely more focused on breaking their losing streak than making an optimal play\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. After losing to paper, they're most likely to play scissors either as an aggressive move or expecting me to stick with paper after my win.\n\n[move] rock I choose rock, anticipating a scissors play from an opponent looking to break their losing streak.\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   * My moves: rock\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   * Their moves: paper\u2192scissors\u2192paper\n   * They returned to paper after losing with scissors\n   * I successfully broke my rock pattern\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * I'm on a two-win streak\n   * They've lost two in a row\n   * They might be feeling pressure as game nears end\n   * Their paper play was predictable (trying to beat expected rock)\n\n4. Their likely mindset:\n   * After two consecutive losses:\n      - They need to break their losing streak\n      - They might abandon pattern-based play\n      - They might return to basics\n   * They've been successfully read twice now\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   * After losing to scissors, typical responses are:\n      - Play rock (defensive against scissors)\n      - Play scissors (aggressive new approach)\n      - Stay with paper (unlikely after loss)\n   * Given their recent losses:\n      - They likely won't play paper again\n      - Rock is their most logical move\n      - Scissors would be their most aggressive option\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper. After losing to scissors, they're most likely to play rock either as a defensive move or to counter my potential scissors repeat. While scissors might seem tempting after success, paper protects against their most probable response.\n\n[move] paper I choose paper, anticipating a defensive rock play after their scissors loss, while accepting the risk of an aggressive scissors counter.\n"

Strategic calculation:\n   * If following clockwise pattern:\n      - I would play scissors\n      - They would play paper\n   * However:\n      - They've lost following patterns\n      - They lost last time to my pattern break\n      - They're likely to break pattern now\n   * Given their desperate position:\n      - They might play scissors aggressively\n      - They might play rock defensively\n      - Paper is least likely as it just lost twice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock. While continuing the clockwise rotation to scissors might seem logical, they're likely to break patterns after three losses. They might play scissors either as an aggressive move or expecting me to continue clockwise to scissors.\n\n[move] rock I choose rock, breaking the clockwise rotation while anticipating either an aggressive scissors play or their counter to my expected scissors move.\n",
