He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Given no prior information:\n   - Rock beats scissors (1 point)\n   - Paper beats rock (1 point)\n   - Scissors beats paper (1 point)\n   - Same moves result in 0 points\n\n4. Without any historical data or patterns to analyze, I should avoid being predictable.\n\n5. A common first move by many players is rock, as it's often seen as a \"strong\" opening move. Therefore, paper might be a good counter.\n\n6. However, if they anticipate this thinking, they might choose scissors. This illustrates the cyclical nature of the game.\n\n7. Given this is the first move and there's equal probability for any choice, I'll choose rock as it's a balanced option - not too aggressive (like scissors) or too defensive (like paper).\n\n[move] rock\n",

Recent pattern:\n   - My scissors beat their paper\n   - My paper beat their rock\n   - Now we tied with rock\n   - Momentum broken by the tie\n\n2. Historical rock tie patterns:\n   - Rock ties often led to:\n   a) Multiple rock standoffs, or\n   b) Their switch to paper\n   - They've shown consistency in using paper to break rock ties\n   - But they also know that I know this pattern\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - The tie has reset the dynamics\n   - They've had a moment to regroup after losses\n   - They might feel more comfortable returning to paper\n   - But they know I've been reading their paper plays well\n\n4. Critical decision points:\n   - If they play true to form, they'll use paper to break tie\n   - If they try to counter my expectations, they'll play scissors\n   - They rarely stick with rock after ties\n   - Their paper preference remains their strongest tendency\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Despite the risk of overthinking\n   - Their paper preference has been remarkably consistent\n   - They've regularly used paper to break rock ties\n   - Even knowing I might expect it, they often return to paper\n   - I'll play scissors, betting on their paper tendency\n\n[move] scissors\n",
        "Let me think through this step by step:\n\n1. Current situation:\n   - Rock tie just broke my winning streak\n   - We're mirroring moves again\n   - Back to a neutral position\n   - Similar to previous rock tie situations\n\n2. Historical rock tie patterns:\n   - After rock ties, they frequently:\n   - Return to paper (their comfort move)\n   - Use it as a reset point before new strategy\n   - This pattern has been consistent and profitable for me\n\n3. Recent game flow:\n   - They've lost several times to my ability to read their paper preference\n   - Yet they still often return to paper\n   - Especially after neutral positions like this rock tie\n   - This has become a reliable tell\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - They might finally adapt and stop their paper pattern\n   - But their behavior suggests strong preference for paper\n   - Even when it's predictable, they return to it\n   - The risk of them changing now seems lower than the probability of paper\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Despite the possibility of overthinking\n   - Their paper preference after rock ties is too strong\n   - The pattern has been reliable throughout the game\n   - I'll play scissors, expecting another paper play\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Current sequence review:\n   - Won with scissors vs paper\n   - Won with paper vs rock\n   - Just tied with rock vs rock\n   - The tie broke my winning momentum\n\n2. Historical rock tie patterns:\n   - Rock ties often lead to:\n   a) Multiple rock standoffs, or\n   b) Someone breaking with paper\n   - Earlier they used paper after rock ties\n   - But they know I know this pattern\n\n3. Psychological dynamics:\n   - They've stopped my winning streak\n   - Rock represents a safe, defensive position\n   - They might feel more comfortable after stopping momentum\n   - This could prompt return to their paper comfort zone\n\n4. Their likely strategy:\n   - They've consistently shown paper preference\n   - They use rock ties as reset points\n   - They often return to paper after stabilizing\n   - But they know I've punished paper plays repeatedly\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Despite knowing their paper tendency\n   - And despite success with scissors vs their paper\n   - Playing scissors feels too obvious and risky\n   - I believe they'll expect scissors and play rock again\n   - Therefore, I'll play paper to beat their likely rock\n\n[move] paper\n",
