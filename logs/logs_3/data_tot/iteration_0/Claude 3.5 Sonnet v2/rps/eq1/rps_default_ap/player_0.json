    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've now lost five consecutive times with rock, yet based on their demonstrated behavior in this game, they show an almost unprecedented resistance to strategic adaptation. Earlier in the game, they continued playing paper even after multiple losses to scissors, and now they're showing the same stubborn adherence to rock. While it defies conventional game theory, their consistent pattern throughout this game suggests they will likely give rock at least one more try before changing. I'll use paper again, though I acknowledge they must be under immense pressure to finally switch to scissors.\n"

This follows their general pattern of eventually adapting, but only after an unusually high number of losses. Given that they just succeeded with scissors against my paper, based on their demonstrated behavior throughout this game, they are very likely to stick with scissors since it just worked for them. They've consistently shown a tendency to stick with moves that have recently succeeded. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their expected scissors play.\n"
