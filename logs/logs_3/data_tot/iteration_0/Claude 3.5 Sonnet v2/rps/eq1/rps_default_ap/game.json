While conventional game theory would suggest they must adapt now (making rock the logical choice for them and therefore making my scissors play risky), their behavioral pattern has been so consistent that I'll stick with scissors. Their resistance to adaptation has been remarkable, and until they definitively show they can break this pattern, exploiting it remains the highest expected value play.\n",
        "[move] scissors While it might seem predictable to use scissors again, my opponent has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to playing paper throughout our entire game. They've lost to scissors multiple times but continue to return to paper, even after brief deviations to other moves. Their behavior suggests either a predetermined strategy or a remarkable resistance to adaptation. Given this consistent pattern and their apparent reluctance to change strategy even when it's clearly not working, I'll continue with scissors. The risk of them suddenly changing their deeply ingrained pattern seems lower than the probability of them playing paper again.\n",
        "[move] scissors My opponent has displayed one of the most consistent patterns I've seen, repeatedly playing paper despite losing to scissors multiple times. While it seems almost too simple to keep playing scissors, their behavior suggests they have a very strong bias towards paper that overrides even clear strategic losses.

While conventional game theory would suggest they must surely change their strategy now, their behavior throughout the game has shown an unusual commitment to playing paper regardless of outcomes. Even in rounds where they briefly deviated to rock, they quickly reverted to paper. This seems to indicate either a predetermined strategy or a player who isn't adapting to game outcomes.

At this point, despite it seeming too simple or obvious, I'll continue with scissors because: 1) they've established an extremely strong pattern of playing paper, 2) even when they occasionally deviate, they quickly return to paper, and 3) they've shown minimal strategic adaptation throughout our many rounds.

They've shown that even when they occasionally deviate from paper, they quickly return to it. This seems to be either a predetermined strategy or a player who is not adapting to game outcomes.

At this point in the game, I've won numerous times with scissors against their paper, yet they persistently return to playing paper even after occasional deviations. This behavior defies standard game theory expectations where players should adapt to losing patterns. Since they've demonstrated such strong commitment to their paper strategy even in the face of consistent losses, I'll continue with scissors.

This could be due to a pre-programmed strategy, a training limitation, or some other constraint.
