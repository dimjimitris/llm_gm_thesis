Critical pattern insights:\n   * Second scissors tie in last 3 rounds\n   * They're alternating between rock and scissors\n   * When not playing scissors, they're using rock\n   * They haven't played paper in several rounds\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Multiple scissors ties suggest they're:\n      * Playing cautiously\n      * Falling into predictable patterns\n      * Avoiding paper (which they haven't used recently)\n   * They need to break both the tie pattern and their rock-scissors alternation\n\n4. Pattern prediction:\n   * Low chance they'll play scissors third time\n   * Medium chance they'll play rock (their alternating pattern)\n   * High chance they'll play paper because:\n      * Breaks their rock-scissors pattern\n      * Haven't used it in several rounds\n      * Logical choice to break scissors tie\n      * Could counter potential rock from me\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   * Given their likely pattern break and probable paper play:\n      * Scissors is again the optimal choice\n      * It beats their likely paper strategy\n      * Takes advantage of their probable attempt to break patterns\n      * Maintains pressure while adapting to their expected adjustment\n      * Even if they play rock, my overall position remains very strong\n\n[move] scissors\n"
