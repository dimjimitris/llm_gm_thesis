Let me analyze the basic game dynamics:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss -1 point\n\n3. Without any prior information about the opponent's tendencies:\n   - Each move has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying\n   - No move is inherently stronger than others in a one-shot game\n\n4. Common player psychology in first moves:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move as it feels \"strong\"\n   - This might make paper a good opening choice\n\n5. However, if the opponent is thinking the same way:\n   - They might anticipate this and choose scissors to counter paper\n   - This creates a circular logic typical of RPS\n\n6. Given this uncertainty, I'll choose rock:\n   - It's a solid opening move\n   - If opponent overthinks, they might choose paper\n   - If opponent uses scissors, I win\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing last round's outcome:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose rock\n   - This suggests the opponent might have similar initial strategic thinking\n   - Or they might also favor rock as an opening move\n\n2. Psychology after a tie:\n   - Players often shift their strategy after a tie\n   - Many players assume their opponent will change their move\n   - After rock, paper is a common follow-up choice\n\n3. Considering opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper (to beat their previous rock)\n   - This could lead them to choose scissors to counter anticipated paper\n   - Or they might stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect that\n\n4. Making a strategic decision:\n   - If I choose paper, I win against rock but lose to scissors\n   - If I choose rock again, I win against scissors but lose to paper\n   - If I choose scissors, I win against paper but lose to rock\n\n5. Given this analysis:\n   - Since ties often lead to changes, opponent likely won't use rock again\n   - Paper is the most predictable next move\n   - Therefore, scissors would be the optimal counter\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
