    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Without any prior information about the opponent's strategy:\n   - Each move has equal chances of winning, losing, or tying\n   - No move has inherent advantage\n\n4. Common player psychology in first moves:\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice as it feels \"strong\"\n   - This might make paper a good counter\n\n5. However, if opponent anticipates this thinking:\n   - They might choose scissors to counter paper\n   - This creates a circular reasoning situation\n\n6. Given this uncertainty, I'll choose rock:\n   - It's a balanced option\n   - Psychologically feels secure for a first move\n   - If opponent overthinks, they might choose scissors, giving me an advantage\n\n[move] rock\n"

Decision:\n   - Will play rock\n   - Reasoning:\n     * Counters likely scissors response to my paper win\n     * If they play paper, I lose but it's calculated risk\n     * Protected against repeat of scissors\n     * Shows confidence while maintaining safety\n     * Avoids obvious paper repeat\n     * Takes advantage of opponent's possible tilt\n     * Good balance of aggression and protection while behind\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Last three rounds:\n     * Scissors tie\n     * Won with paper vs rock\n     * Won with rock vs scissors\n   - Two consecutive wins\n   - Score now even at 0\n   - Complete momentum shift\n\n2. Current momentum:\n   - Back to even score\n   - Successfully read last two moves\n   - Opponent seems destabilized\n   - Recovered from -2 position\n   - Strong position psychologically\n\n3. Opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Lost last two rounds\n   - Tried scissors and lost\n   - Their strategy seems less cohesive\n   - May be frustrated after losing lead\n   - Might be seeking new approach\n\n4. Psychological assessment:\n   - I have momentum advantage\n   - Opponent may be:\n     * Feeling pressure after losing lead\n     * Looking to change strategy\n     * More likely to make emotional play\n     * Trying to regain control\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Opponent likely expects me to stick with winning rock\n   - They might play paper as obvious counter\n   - Could try to double-bluff with scissors again\n   - Need to maintain unpredictability despite success\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Will play scissors\n   - Reasoning:\n     * If they play expected paper, I win\n     * If they repeat scissors, we tie (acceptable)\n     * If they play rock, I lose but worth the risk\n     * Breaks from my winning rock play\n     * Shows confidence to maintain aggression\n     * Takes advantage of their likely paper counter\n     * Maintains initiative in newly even game\n\n[move] scissors\n"
