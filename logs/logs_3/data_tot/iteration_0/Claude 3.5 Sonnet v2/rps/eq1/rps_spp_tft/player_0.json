    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and identifying trends\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing rock-paper-scissors without any prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. There's no dominant strategy.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we cannot predict the opponent's behavior. However, studies have shown that rock is often the most common first move made by players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that rock is a common first move, we could consider playing paper to counter this tendency. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing to scissors. The risk is balanced as any move has equal potential for winning or losing.\n\nGame Strategist: Agree with the analysis. While paper might give us a slight edge against novice players who tend to choose rock first, any move is theoretically equally valid in this first round.\n\nAI Assistant: Based on our discussion, while any move is theoretically equal, there might be a slight advantage in playing paper due to the psychological tendency of new players to choose rock first.\n\n[move] paper Going with paper as it might counter the common tendency of choosing rock as a first move.\n"

Now we need to consider if they will:\na) Stay with rock (some players are stubborn)\nb) Switch to paper to counter our previous paper\nc) Switch to scissors to beat our previous paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: The opponent just lost using rock against our paper. Based on typical player psychology, they are likely to:\n1. Either switch to scissors to beat our paper (assuming we'll use paper again)\n2. Or switch to paper (following the natural progression rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n\nRisk Manager: Given that the opponent just lost, they are very likely to change their move. Continuing with paper would be risky. Since they're most likely to switch to either paper or scissors, rock would be our safest counter-move.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Risk Manager. Rock would protect against scissors (their most likely move to counter our previous paper) and draw against paper (their second most likely move).\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. The opponent is likely to switch their move after losing, and scissors would be their most logical choice to counter our previous paper move. Let's use rock to counter this expected adaptation.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors to counter our previous paper move.\n"

The opponent is likely feeling frustrated after three losses and might:\n1. Become erratic in their choice\n2. Try to outthink us by assuming we'll continue our pattern\n3.

However, given their frustration level, they're more likely to try to break both their own pattern and ours.\n\nPattern Analyzer: When players lose repeatedly, they often return to rock as it feels most secure.

Players often avoid their most recently failed move (rock)\n2. They might try to \"outsmart\" us by thinking we'd never expect them to repeat their losing pattern\n3. They could resort to scissors, which they haven't used in several rounds\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their state of mind, they're most likely to:\n1. Avoid rock (just lost with it)\n2. Try scissors (hasn't been used recently)\n3. Be wary of paper (lost with it two moves ago)\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis suggests they're most likely to use scissors. After losing with rock again, and with paper failing them recently, scissors might appear as their best option. The psychological pressure of eight losses might push them to choose scissors as it's been their least used move in recent rounds.\n\n[move] rock Expecting opponent to switch to scissors as their least recently used move and an attempt to break their losing streak.\n"
