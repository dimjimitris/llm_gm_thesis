    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - To study opponent behavior and adapt accordingly\n3. Risk Manager - To evaluate risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - To make the final decision\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In a fresh game against a new player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In game theory, when playing against a rational opponent with no prior information, each move should have an equal probability of being chosen to avoid being exploited.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we cannot make any predictions based on patterns. However, many players tend to choose 'rock' as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we have no prior information, we should avoid any high-risk strategies. Paper would be a good counter to the common 'rock' first move, while only being vulnerable to scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. While all moves are theoretically equal in a single round, the psychological aspect of first moves makes paper slightly advantageous against typical human players.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this discussion, I'll go with paper as it has a good chance of winning against a potential 'rock' opening, which is common among new players.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They are also using game theory principles\n2. They have a preference for paper\n3. It was just coincidence\n\nPattern Analyst: The tie with paper gives us our first data point. Players who get a tie often tend to either:\n- Switch to what would have beaten their previous move (scissors in this case)\n- Stick with the same move hoping the opponent will switch\n- Switch to what their previous move would have beaten (rock in this case)\n\nRisk Manager: Given that we tied with paper, there's a higher chance our opponent might switch to scissors to beat our previous paper move. We should consider playing rock to counter this potential adaptation.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. If our opponent is strategic, they might try to counter our previous paper with scissors. Rock would be a strong counter-play to this potential adaptation.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychology of a tie often leads players to want to \"win\" the next round, making them more likely to switch their move rather than stick with paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The analysis suggests rock would be our best move here. It protects against the likely scissors counter-play to our previous paper, and even if they stick with paper, we would only tie again.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They have a strong preference for paper\n2. They are skilled at predicting standard counter-moves\n3. They are using a consistent strategy to confuse us\n\nPattern Analyst: Two papers in a row is significant. There are three main possibilities:\n1. They might stick with their winning strategy and play paper again\n2. They might expect us to play paper to counter their paper, and switch to scissors\n3. They might expect us to play scissors to counter their papers, and switch to rock\n\nRisk Manager: We've lost one point now, so we need to be more careful. The opponent has shown consistency with paper, but this could be setting up a trap. However, if they truly favor paper, scissors would be our best counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that scissors is our best move here. Even if they switch to rock anticipating this, they would only be reacting to what we should obviously do, which means they might stick to paper expecting us to overthink.\n\nPattern Analyst: The psychological advantage is now with the opponent after their win. Players who win often become more confident in their strategy, increasing the likelihood they'll stick with what's working - in this case, paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The evidence points strongly towards playing scissors. The opponent has shown a clear paper pattern, and even if they're setting up a trap, it's the most logical move given the information we have.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they expect us to counter their rock with paper, they might play scissors\n2. If they try to continue their paper strategy, we only lose one more point\n3.

After using paper heavily early, they've now used both rock and scissors. A common psychological response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's winning move - in this case, paper to beat our rock.\n\nRisk Manager: We're now at -1 points total. While we have momentum from the win, we shouldn't get overconfident. The opponent has shown they can adapt their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're using basic pattern prediction, they'll expect us to either:\n1. Stick with rock after our success\n2. Switch to paper anticipating their paper\n3. Switch to scissors trying to get ahead of their strategy\n\nPattern Analyst: After a player loses with scissors, they rarely immediately return to scissors. They're most likely to play either paper (to beat our potential rock) or rock (to be defensive).\n\nRisk Manager: Given the opponent's demonstrated sophistication, we should play scissors. Here's why:\n1. It beats the most likely paper response\n2. If they play rock again, we've proven we can recover from losses\n3.
