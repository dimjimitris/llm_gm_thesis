    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Assessor - For evaluating risks and rewards of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, game theory suggests that we should consider the Nash equilibrium, which in Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play each option with equal probability (1/3).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we can't make predictions based on patterns. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's evaluate the risks:\n- Rock: Safe choice, but vulnerable to paper\n- Paper: Good counter to common rock opening, but vulnerable to scissors\n- Scissors: Risky as rock is a common opening move\n\nGiven this analysis, I suggest going with paper. It counters the common rock opening, and even if we're wrong, we only lose 1 point.\n\nGame Strategist: I support this reasoning. Paper has good potential upside against a likely rock opening, and the downside is manageable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper is chosen as it counters the common opening move of rock while having manageable downside risk.\n"

They're an experienced player who anticipated our paper strategy\n2. They have an aggressive playing style\n3. Or it could be just random\n\nGame Strategist: Given that we lost to scissors, the opponent might be tempted to use scissors again due to its success. However, they might also anticipate that we'll switch to rock to counter their previous scissors, and thus switch to paper themselves.\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze our options:\n1. Rock: Good choice if they repeat scissors, but vulnerable if they anticipate this and switch to paper\n2. Paper: Risky as they've just successfully used scissors\n3. Scissors: Could work if they switch to paper, but risky if they go with rock\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I would recommend rock. Here's why:\n- It directly counters their previous winning move\n- Even experienced players often repeat successful moves\n- If they try to counter our expected rock with paper, we only lose 1 point, which is acceptable\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with rock. Also, many players don't use the same move three times in a row, so if they used scissors once, they're likely to switch anyway.\n\nRisk Assessor: Rock does provide the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. It protects against scissors and has manageable downside against paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Based on the opponent's aggressive opening with scissors, rock provides good protection while having acceptable downside risk.\n"

Our opponent has used scissors twice in a row now:\nRound 1: They used scissors (we lost with paper)\nRound 2: They used scissors again (we won with rock)\nThis shows a strong preference for scissors, possibly indicating:\n1. A stubborn strategy\n2. Attempting to establish a pattern to break later\n3. Limited tactical thinking\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. We need to consider:\n1. Will they finally abandon scissors after two consecutive attempts?\n2. Are they trying to make us overconfident in choosing rock?\n3. Could this be part of a larger mind game?\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze our options considering they've used scissors twice:\n1. Rock: Safe if they use scissors again, but might be too predictable now\n2. Paper: Very risky given their scissors preference\n3. Scissors: Could work if they're finally switching to paper to counter our rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: Three scissors in a row would be highly unusual for most players. After losing with scissors, they're likely to switch. Given that we just used rock successfully, they might expect us to use rock again and choose paper to counter.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend staying with rock. Here's why:\n- If they use scissors a third time, we win\n- If they switch to paper, we lose one point but gain valuable information\n- If they switch to rock, it's a tie and we lose nothing\n- Most importantly, the downside risk is limited while maintaining protection against their demonstrated preference\n\nRisk Assessor: Agreed. Rock maintains a balanced position while protecting against their shown preference for scissors.

Their pattern shows they:\n1. Stick to moves for two rounds\n2. Switch after two rounds regardless of results\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial observation. If the pattern holds, they should be switching away from paper now. Their previous sequence was:\nScissors (2 rounds) \u2192 Paper (2 rounds) \u2192 Next logical move would be Rock\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze our options considering this pattern:\n1. Rock: Safe against their potential scissors, but they seem to be following a different pattern\n2. Paper: Would beat their predicted rock move\n3. Scissors: Risky if they switch to rock as predicted\n\nPattern Analyzer: The \"two rounds per move\" pattern is strong enough that we should take it seriously. Following this logic, they should be switching to rock now.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for this round. Here's why:\n- It directly counters their predicted rock move based on the observed pattern\n- They've shown consistency in their two-round pattern\n- Even if we're wrong, it helps confirm or deny our pattern recognition\n- They might try to break their pattern, but this itself would give us valuable information\n\nRisk Assessor: The downside risk with paper is acceptable.

Testing if we noticed their previous pattern\n\nRisk Assessor: Let's analyze options given this new development:\n1. Rock: Safe against potential scissors switch\n2. Paper: Would result in another tie if they stick with paper\n3.
