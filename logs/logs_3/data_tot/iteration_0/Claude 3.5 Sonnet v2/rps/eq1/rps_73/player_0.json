    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Complete pattern analysis:\n   * Round 19: I rock, they scissors (I won)\n   * Round 20: I paper, they rock (I won)\n   * Round 21: I scissors, they scissors (tie)\n   * Round 22: I paper, they rock (I won)\n   * Overall: 12 wins, 4 losses, 6 ties\n   * Their recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n2. Current momentum analysis:\n   * I've won with paper against rock twice recently\n   * They're showing a pattern of alternating scissors and rock\n   * I'm continuing to extend my lead\n   * They're becoming more predictable under pressure\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They've lost multiple times to paper\n   * They're falling into readable patterns\n   * Under significant pressure from score differential\n   * In such situations, players typically:\n      * Try to break obvious patterns\n      * Counter what's beating them\n      * Make aggressive moves\n\n4. Pattern prediction:\n   * Very low chance they'll play rock third time\n   * Low chance they'll play scissors (part of failing pattern)\n   * High chance they'll play paper because:\n      * Counters their losing pattern\n      * Breaks their rock-scissors alternation\n      * Natural counter to my winning paper plays\n      * They need to change strategy\n\n5.

Critical pattern insights:\n   * Second scissors tie in last 3 rounds\n   * They're alternating between rock and scissors\n   * When not playing scissors, they're using rock\n   * They haven't played paper in several rounds\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * Multiple scissors ties suggest they're:\n      * Playing cautiously\n      * Falling into predictable patterns\n      * Avoiding paper (which they haven't used recently)\n   * They need to break both the tie pattern and their rock-scissors alternation\n\n4. Pattern prediction:\n   * Low chance they'll play scissors third time\n   * Medium chance they'll play rock (their alternating pattern)\n   * High chance they'll play paper because:\n      * Breaks their rock-scissors pattern\n      * Haven't used it in several rounds\n      * Logical choice to break scissors tie\n      * Could counter potential rock from me\n\n5.
