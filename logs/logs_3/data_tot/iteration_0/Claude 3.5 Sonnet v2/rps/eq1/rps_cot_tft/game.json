For the first move, I should consider:\n   - Each move has equal chance of winning (33.3%)\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players due to psychological reasons\n   - Paper would beat the common rock choice\n\n4. Since this is a fresh start:\n   - Playing paper would beat rock if opponent chooses it\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie\n\n5. Given these considerations, I'll choose paper as it could give me an advantage if the opponent plays the psychologically common first choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - They might expect me to stay with rock since it won\n   - They might switch to paper to beat rock\n   - They seem to favor scissors, but after two scissors plays and a loss, change is likely\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Keep rock: Safe but predictable\n   - Switch to paper: Would win if they switch to rock\n   - Switch to scissors: Would win if they switch to paper\n\n5.

Decision:\n   - I'll choose scissors because:\n     * Breaks expected rotation pattern\n     * Counters likely paper play if they try to beat rock\n     * They're probably too frustrated to make optimal choice\n     * Even if they play rock, they're under significant pressure\n     * Maintains unpredictability in my strategy\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent history analysis:\n   - Last five moves show complete dominance:\n     * Broke ties with scissors beats paper\n     * Paper beats rock\n     * Rock beats scissors\n     * Scissors beats paper\n     * Four consecutive wins\n     * Return to pre-tie streak dominance\n\n2. Pattern recognition:\n   - My adaptable strategy is working\n   - They're highly predictable now\n   - They've lost multiple times with paper\n   - Their moves show decreasing strategic thought\n\n3. Psychological state:\n   - After four straight losses following tie streak:\n     * Complete psychological collapse likely\n     * Total loss of confidence\n     * Return to maximum frustration\n     * Possible resignation\n     * Decision-making severely impaired\n\n4. Their probable mindset:\n   - Likely experiencing:\n     * Deep frustration at losing tie advantage\n     * Inability to read my moves\n     * Decision paralysis\n     * Complete strategic breakdown\n     * Return to emotional playing\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - They might:\n     * Try rock as defensive move\n     * Make completely random choice\n     * Attempt to copy my successful moves\n     * Revert to primitive strategy\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n     * They're likely to play rock as safe option\n     * After losing to scissors, they'll avoid paper\n     * Rock is common choice under extreme pressure\n     * They might try to \"reset\" their strategy with basic rock\n     * Even if they play scissors, they're too tilted to capitalize\n     * Breaking my own pattern maintains unpredictability\n\n[move] paper\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
