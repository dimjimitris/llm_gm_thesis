    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For the first move, I should consider:\n   - Each move has equal chance of winning (33.3%)\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players due to psychological reasons\n   - Paper would beat the common rock choice\n\n4. Since this is a fresh start:\n   - Playing paper would beat rock if opponent chooses it\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie\n\n5. Given these considerations, I'll choose paper as it could give me an advantage if the opponent plays the psychologically common first choice of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If opponent sticks with scissors:\n   - Rock would be my best counter\n   - I would win if they repeat scissors\n   - I would lose to paper if they switch\n\n4.

Consider opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - They might expect me to stay with rock since it won\n   - They might switch to paper to beat rock\n   - They seem to favor scissors, but after two scissors plays and a loss, change is likely\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Keep rock: Safe but predictable\n   - Switch to paper: Would win if they switch to rock\n   - Switch to scissors: Would win if they switch to paper\n\n5.

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent history analysis:\n   - Last three significant moves:\n     * Broke 5-tie streak with scissors beats paper\n     * Followed with paper beats rock\n     * Two consecutive wins after long tie sequence\n     * Successfully predicted their defensive rock play\n\n2. Pattern development:\n   - They've shown:\n     * Abandonment of mirroring strategy\n     * Return to defensive play (rock)\n     * Predictable responses under pressure\n     * Loss of strategic initiative\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   - Their state likely includes:\n     * Growing frustration after tie streak broken\n     * Loss of confidence in previous success\n     * Return of uncertainty\n     * Defensive mindset returning\n\n4. Their probable thought process:\n   - They likely:\n     * Feel pressure from two straight losses\n     * Want to break new losing streak\n     * Miss their successful tie strategy\n     * Are struggling to read my moves again\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - They might:\n     * Try scissors to counter my paper\n     * Use rock again hoping for safety\n     * Attempt to restart mirroring\n     * Make aggressive move out of frustration\n\n6. Decision:\n   - I'll choose rock because:\n     * Counters likely scissors play\n     * They probably expect me to stick with paper\n     * After losing with rock, scissors is logical counter\n     * Protects against aggressive response\n     * They're likely to abandon defensive rock after loss\n     * Breaking my own pattern prevents easy reads\n\n[move] rock\n"
