If they stick with paper, I should play scissors\n\n6. Given that many people switch after ties, and rock is a common \"strong\" choice, I think there's a good chance they'll go to rock. Therefore, paper might be a good choice again.\n\nBut actually, let me think differently - if I expect them to think I'll switch, and they expect me to switch to either rock or scissors, they might play paper again to beat rock or tie with scissors. \n\nHmm, this is getting circular. Let me just make a reasoned choice: I'll go with rock this time, as it beats scissors (which is a common switch from paper) and if they stick with paper, I only lose 1 point.",
