Some players also switch to the move that just beat them (paper), but scissors seems more likely given the counter-thinking pattern.\n6. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat it.\n7.

A fresh player could mean:\n1. A new player who doesn't have much strategy\n2. A player who might make random moves\n3. A player who might use common beginner strategies\n\nFor a first move against a fresh player, I should consider:\n- Fresh players often choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically the most \"aggressive\" and straightforward choice)\n- If they choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it\n- But this is just a guess - they could choose anything\n\nSince I have no information about their patterns yet, I need to make a strategic first move. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. Rock - beats scissors, loses to paper\n2. Paper - beats rock, loses to scissors  \n3. Scissors - beats paper, loses to rock\n\nSince many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's a common psychological tendency), paper would be a good counter-strategy for the first move.\n\nSteps:\n1.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
