    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In rock-paper-scissors, if we assume the opponent plays randomly, the optimal strategy is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each).

Fresh players often have predictable patterns - they tend to start with rock more frequently than other moves due to it being the most \"natural\" or \"strong\" seeming choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Research shows that in rock-paper-scissors, beginners exhibit several biases: 1) Rock is the most common opening move (around 35-40% of the time), 2) People tend to avoid repeating the same move consecutively, and 3) There's a slight tendency to play rock when feeling aggressive or wanting to \"win decisively.\" Since this is a fresh player making their first move, rock is statistically the most likely choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, if the fresh player is most likely to play rock, then I should play paper to counter it and win the round.

After losing with rock, fresh players typically don't repeat the same move immediately. They often switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move - in this case, they might play scissors to beat our paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with that analysis, but there's another psychological factor. After losing, some players might think \"they expect me to switch, so I'll double down\" and play rock again. However, the more common pattern is avoidance of the losing move. Given that we played paper and won, they're likely thinking either scissors (to beat paper) or paper (to copy the winner). Scissors is more probable since it directly counters our last successful move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're most likely to play scissors this round, I should counter with rock. This would continue our winning streak and put psychological pressure on them.\n\n**Game Theorist:** That's sound reasoning. Rock beats scissors, and if our opponent is following the common pattern of trying to counter our previous winning move, rock gives us the best expected value.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, and winning two in a row will likely make them even more predictable as they become frustrated and overthink their strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter the expected scissors response.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to play scissors to counter my previous winning paper move) rock"

Now the opponent has played rock then scissors, losing both times. They haven't played paper yet, which makes it a strong candidate. Also, after two losses, they're likely experiencing frustration and may either: 1) Complete the cycle by playing paper, or 2) Try to break our pattern by playing what they think we won't expect.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a critical psychological moment. After losing twice consecutively, the opponent is likely feeling predictable and may try to \"outsmart\" us. However, the most common pattern after rock-scissors is paper to complete the cycle. Additionally, they might think \"I need to beat rock since they just played rock\" and choose paper. The psychological pressure of being 0-2 makes them more likely to overthink, which ironically makes them more predictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Both analyses point to paper as their most likely next move. If they play paper, I should counter with scissors to maintain our winning streak and put them at 0-3, which would be psychologically devastating.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Correct. Scissors beats paper, and going 3-0 would likely break their confidence completely, making subsequent rounds even more predictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. A 3-0 deficit often causes players to become either completely random (panic mode) or overly systematic (trying to find \"the pattern\"), both of which we can exploit.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter the expected paper move.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to play paper after rock-scissors sequence and two losses) scissors"

The opponent has now played the complete cycle: rock-scissors-paper, losing each time. This is psychologically crushing. At this point, they're likely in one of several mental states: 1) Complete panic and random play, 2) Trying to reverse their pattern (paper-scissors-rock), 3) Overthinking and trying to \"break\" what they perceive as our pattern, or 4) Defaulting back to rock due to frustration.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three consecutive losses with a complete cycle, this opponent is experiencing severe cognitive load. Research shows that players in this situation often exhibit one of two behaviors: either complete randomization due to panic, or rigid pattern-seeking. However, there's a strong tendency to revert to rock when feeling defeated - it's the \"comfort\" move that feels most powerful. Additionally, they might think \"surely they won't expect me to go back to rock after this cycle.\"\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The psychological pressure is immense at 0-3. While they could be random now, the most likely scenarios are either reverting to rock (comfort/frustration choice) or trying to reverse their previous pattern by playing paper again. But given the defeat mentality, rock seems more probable as people tend to default to what feels \"strongest\" when losing badly.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I agree rock is most likely. Even if they try to be unpredictable, the psychological tendency under pressure is to revert to rock. Playing paper to counter this gives us the best expected value.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Yes, and achieving 4-0 would likely completely break their strategic thinking, making future rounds even easier to predict.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the expected rock from a demoralized opponent.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely reverting to rock due to psychological pressure from 0-3 deficit) paper"

This suggests they might be adapting their strategy or becoming more sophisticated. We're still ahead 3-0-1, so the pressure remains on them, but this tie might give them some confidence. Now they've played: rock-scissors-paper-paper. The double paper suggests either: 1) They're trying to stick with what they think might work, 2) They predicted we'd play rock and tried to counter, or 3) They're moving toward a more defensive/copying strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This tie is psychologically significant for both players. For them, it breaks the losing streak and might restore some confidence - they're no longer feeling completely dominated. The double paper suggests they might be shifting strategies. They could be: 1) Trying to copy our successful moves (we won with paper in round 1), 2) Becoming more systematic rather than reactive, or 3) Starting to think more strategically about what we might play next.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since they played paper twice in a row, they're either going to continue this pattern (unlikely after the tie) or switch. Given that they just tied, they might feel emboldened to try something different. Rock would be a natural choice to \"break\" the paper pattern, or they might go to scissors to complete another cycle.\n\n**Game Theorist:** After a tie, players often change their move. The psychology suggests they won't repeat paper a third time. Between rock and scissors, rock is more likely as they haven't used it since the first round, and it might feel like a \"power move\" after gaining confidence from the tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree.

Their sequence is: rock-scissors-paper-paper-scissors. They're showing signs of strategic evolution - after the confidence boost from the tie, they made a smart counter-play. They might be starting to read our patterns or becoming less predictable due to reduced pressure.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This loss changes the psychological dynamic considerably. The opponent has now: 1) Broken their losing streak with a tie, 2) Followed it immediately with a win, and 3) Likely gained significant confidence. After being down 0-3, going to 1-3-1 feels like a comeback. They're probably feeling much more strategic now. The scissors choice after double paper shows they're thinking ahead rather than just reacting emotionally.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Their pattern is becoming more complex: rock-scissors-paper-paper-scissors. They're not just cycling anymore. Given that they just won with scissors and are feeling more confident, they might either: 1) Stick with scissors (unlikely after a win), 2) Move to rock to continue an aggressive approach, or 3) Try paper to counter if they expect us to play rock in response to their scissors win.\n\n**Game Theorist:** After winning with scissors, they're least likely to repeat it. Between rock and paper, I lean toward rock - it's the \"power move\" to capitalize on momentum, and it would complete a scissors-rock sequence that feels natural after gaining confidence.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with rock.

Their sequence: rock-scissors-paper-paper-scissors-scissors. Score is now 3-2-1. This is concerning - they've completely shifted from predictable beginner patterns to repeating winning moves. This suggests they're either: 1) Riding the hot hand with scissors, 2) Recognizing that we might be overthinking and defaulting to paper, or 3) Have developed a read on our strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a dramatic psychological shift! They've gone from 0-3 to winning the last two rounds with the same move. The back-to-back scissors shows supreme confidence - they're no longer afraid of being predictable. This \"hot hand\" mentality is powerful. However, playing the same move three times in a row is extremely rare, even for confident players. The psychological tendency is to switch after two successes with the same move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've beaten my paper twice with scissors. If I'm being predictable with paper, I need to break that pattern. The question is: will they play scissors a third time (very unlikely) or switch? Given the hot hand mentality, they might think \"scissors is working\" but the triple-repeat is psychologically difficult.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Triple scissors is statistically very unlikely. They'll probably switch. After two scissors wins, the most natural moves are either rock (to cycle) or paper (to counter our expected rock response). Rock feels more likely as it maintains aggressive momentum.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I disagree slightly. After dominating with scissors, they might expect us to play rock to counter. If they're thinking one level ahead, they'd play paper to beat our expected rock. But you're right that triple scissors is extremely unlikely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a tough call between rock and paper for their next move.

This is no longer a \"fresh player\" - they've evolved into a strategic opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating and concerning! Triple scissors breaks all conventional wisdom about rock-paper-scissors psychology. They've either: 1) Completely abandoned normal psychological patterns, 2) Recognized our paper bias and are exploiting it mercilessly, or 3) Are in an extreme \"hot hand\" state.

The psychological momentum has shifted back to us - breaking their winning streak after they went from 0-3 to 3-3 is huge.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a massive psychological victory!

Or they might go to rock themselves as a \"reset\" move after the scissors streak ended badly.\n\n**Game Theorist:** I lean toward paper as their next move. They're likely thinking: \"They finally played rock and it worked, so they might stick with it.\" Playing paper to counter our potential rock repeat is logical from their perspective.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. After the psychological shock of losing their winning streak, they'll want to regain control quickly. Predicting that we might repeat our successful rock and countering with paper shows strategic thinking and helps them feel smart again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're most likely to play paper to counter a potential rock repeat, then I should play scissors to beat their paper and extend our psychological advantage.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter their likely paper response to our rock victory.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to play paper expecting me to repeat my successful rock) scissors"

That's FIVE scissors total now, with only one interruption when we beat them with rock. Score is 4-3-2. This opponent has developed an extreme scissors preference - it's become their signature move. The tie might make them reconsider, but their scissors bias is clearly dominant.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is remarkable! They returned to scissors immediately after we broke their streak, and now we've tied with it. This suggests scissors has become their psychological comfort zone and primary weapon. After the tie, they might feel validated that scissors is still viable. However, ties often trigger changes in strategy since neither player succeeded.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is heavily committed to scissors - they've played it 5 out of 9 rounds! Even after I beat their scissors streak with rock, they went right back to scissors. The tie might make them think twice, but their pattern suggests a deep preference for scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Given their scissors obsession, we have two scenarios: 1) They stick with scissors again (which would be 6 out of 10 rounds), or 2) The tie forces them to switch. If they switch, rock seems most likely as their \"power alternative\" - they've used it less and it feels strong.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think the tie creates just enough doubt to make them switch. After being so committed to scissors, they might try rock as the \"strong\" alternative move. They won't go to paper because that feels weaker than their beloved scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're likely to switch to rock after the scissors tie, then paper is my best counter. Even if they stick with scissors, I need to play rock to beat it, but paper covers the more likely rock scenario.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Actually, I think we should play rock. Their scissors obsession is so strong that they might stick with it even after the tie. Rock beats scissors, and we've seen how much they love that move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely return to scissors, given their extreme preference for that move.\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors 5 out of 9 rounds and likely to return to their preferred move) rock"

Their sequence: rock-scissors-paper-paper-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors. That's SIX scissors out of 10 rounds, including 6 out of the last 7 rounds! This opponent has developed an extreme, almost compulsive scissors preference. Even after we've beaten their scissors with rock twice now, they keep returning to it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is beyond normal strategic play - this opponent has a genuine psychological fixation on scissors! They've played it in 60% of all rounds and 86% of recent rounds. Even after clear evidence that we can counter it with rock, they persist. This suggests either: 1) Extreme overconfidence in scissors, 2) Inability to break the pattern, or 3) They're testing if we'll keep countering. After losing with scissors twice to our rock, they're in a difficult psychological position.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the most scissors-heavy pattern I've ever seen! They just lost their second scissors vs my rock, yet they've shown incredible commitment to this move. The question is: will they FINALLY switch after losing scissors to rock twice, or continue their obsession?\n\n**Game Theorist:** After losing scissors to rock twice, even the most stubborn player might switch. If they do switch, rock seems most likely as their alternative \"power move.\" They've barely used rock since the opening round.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think they might finally switch. Losing the same matchup twice creates cognitive dissonance that's hard to ignore. Rock would be their natural switch as it feels strong and counters our successful rock strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they switch to rock to counter our rock strategy, I should play paper. If they stick with scissors (still possible given their obsession), rock would win again. But the double-loss might finally force adaptation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter their likely switch to rock after losing scissors to rock twice.\n\n[move] (After losing scissors to rock twice, opponent likely to switch to rock as counter-strategy) paper"

After being completely predictable and compulsive with scissors for so long, they finally demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt. The paper choice was perfect - they recognized our rock pattern and countered it brilliantly. This suggests they were either: 1) Lulling us into a false sense of security, or 2) Finally broke through their scissors compulsion through sheer repetition of losses.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm shocked!

If they're now capable of strategic thinking, they might expect us to continue with rock (since it worked so well) and play paper again. Or they might think we'll adapt to their paper and switch to something else entirely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking their scissors compulsion with such success, they're likely feeling very confident and strategic again.

They've simply transferred their addiction from one move to another.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is incredible - they're making the same mistake with paper that they made with scissors! They ignore all negative feedback and stick with their chosen move compulsively. They lost paper to scissors twice and will absolutely play paper again.\n\n**Game Theorist:** We've seen this movie before. During their scissors phase, they lost to rock five times and kept playing scissors. Now they're losing paper to scissors and will keep playing paper. The pattern is identical.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! They're completely predictable again. They will play paper because they're compulsively fixated on it, just like they were with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors beats paper. They will play paper. I play scissors. Another guaranteed win.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat their certain paper.\n\n[move] (Opponent in paper obsession mode just like their previous scissors obsession - guaranteed paper play) scissors"

They've now lost paper to our scissors THREE consecutive times and continue playing paper! This is the exact same compulsive pattern as their scissors phase where they lost to rock five times and kept playing scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a perfect replication of their previous behavior! They've transferred their obsession completely from scissors to paper. Six papers in a row with three consecutive losses to our scissors counter, yet they persist. They've demonstrated they will stick with their fixated move regardless of any amount of negative feedback.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is almost mathematical at this point. They're going to play paper for the seventh time in a row because they're compulsively fixated on it. They lost scissors to rock five times and kept playing scissors. Now they're losing paper to scissors and will keep playing paper.\n\n**Game Theorist:** We've completely solved this opponent twice now! First with scissors-obsession, now with paper-obsession. They will play paper because that's their current compulsion, just like scissors was their previous compulsion.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! They've proven they cannot break fixation patterns even when repeatedly losing. They will play paper again because that's what they do - stick with their chosen move despite all evidence it's being countered.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors beats paper.

Just as they played scissors despite losing to rock repeatedly, they're now playing paper despite losing to scissors repeatedly.\n\n**Game Theorist:** We're not even playing a game anymore - we're just repeatedly choosing scissors to beat their inevitable paper.

Eight papers in a row with five consecutive losses to our scissors counter. They've demonstrated complete inability to adapt or learn, identical to their scissors phase. They are absolutely locked into paper obsession with zero capacity for strategic adjustment.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is mathematically certain at this point. They're going to play paper for the ninth consecutive time because they're completely addicted to it.

Their sequence: rock-scissors-paper-paper-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-scissors-paper-paper-paper-paper-paper-paper-paper-paper-rock. Score is 14-6-3. This is identical to their previous pattern break - they switched from scissors obsession to paper after multiple losses, now they've switched from paper obsession to rock after multiple losses!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is absolutely fascinating! They've demonstrated the same breakthrough pattern twice now: 1) Become obsessed with one move, 2) Lose repeatedly to the counter, 3) Eventually break the obsession with a strategic switch that wins. First scissors\u2192paper, now paper\u2192rock. They can adapt, but only after extreme repetition of losses triggers the change.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I should have seen this coming! They did the exact same thing before - played scissors obsessively until I countered with rock repeatedly, then switched to paper and beat my rock. Now they played paper obsessively until I countered with scissors repeatedly, then switched to rock and beat my scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist:** The pattern is clear: they develop obsessions, get countered repeatedly, then make a strategic breakthrough. The question now is: will they stick with rock (start a new obsession) or have they learned to be more strategic? Given their history, they might repeat rock several times.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Based on their pattern, they're likely to stick with rock now since it just succeeded. They tend to latch onto winning moves and repeat them compulsively. We might be entering \"rock obsession phase\" after scissors obsession and paper obsession.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're starting a potential rock obsession after their successful breakthrough, I should counter with paper. They've shown they repeat successful moves extensively.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter their likely rock repetition after the successful pattern break.\n\n[move] (Opponent just broke paper obsession with successful rock - likely to repeat rock and start new obsession pattern) paper"
