Since paper vs rock has the highest stakes (+3/-3), this matchup is most important\n2. If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I get +3 points (best case)\n3. If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose -3 points (worst case)\n4. The other matchups have lower stakes\n\nFor the first move against a \"fresh player\" (someone new):\n- I don't have any information about their tendencies\n- In standard rock-paper-scissors, people often default to rock as their first move\n- Given the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3), playing paper seems like a good strategy\n- Even if they don't play rock, the worst I can do is lose 1 point (if they play scissors)\n- The expected value seems favorable for paper\n\nSteps:\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix - paper vs rock has highest stakes\n2. Consider that new players often start with rock\n3.

But they anticipate this and play rock to beat my scissors.\n\nLet me try breaking this cycle by NOT playing the obvious counter to their last move.\n\nThey just played rock. Instead of playing paper (which would beat rock), let me try something else. Maybe rock or scissors.\n\nActually, let me try rock. If they're expecting me to play paper to counter their rock, maybe they'll play scissors to beat my expected paper.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I assume this means someone who hasn't played this variant before or doesn't have much experience.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff differential (6 points swing total)\n2. Rock vs Scissors and Scissors vs Paper have lower payoff differentials (2 points swing each)\n3. This creates an asymmetric game where the paper-rock interaction is much more valuable\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- If I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I get +3 points\n- If I play rock and my opponent plays paper, I get -3 points\n- The other combinations have much smaller point swings\n\nSince paper beating rock gives the highest reward, there might be incentive for players to play paper more often to try to catch opponents playing rock. However, if everyone thinks this way, then scissors becomes valuable to counter the increased paper play.\n\nFor a fresh player, they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoffs and could play more randomly or follow typical rock-paper-scissors intuitions.\n\nGiven that this is the first round and I'm against a fresh player, I think rock might be a reasonable choice because:\n1. Many people default to rock as a first move in rock-paper-scissors\n2. If they play scissors (also common), I win +1\n3. If they play paper, I lose -3, but this is a risk I'm willing to take\n4. If they play rock, it's a tie\n \nReconsidering my initial strategy, paper looks more promising. The potential +3 points from catching a likely rock play outweighs the -1 point risk against scissors. I'll choose paper to maximize my reward potential against a fresh player's probable first move.",

The -3 risk only comes if they try to counter with paper, but that seems less likely given they just lost to rock.\n\nActually wait, let me think about this more carefully. They played scissors last round, which suggests they were trying to counter my paper from round 3. Now they might try paper to counter my rock from round 4.\n\nIf they're following this reactive pattern: paper would be a strong counter choice giving me +1 vs their likely paper choice. Wait no, that's wrong. \n\nLet me be clear:\n- If they play paper (countering my rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n- If they play rock (copying my move): I should play paper (+3)  \n\n\n- If they play scissors (random/other): I should play rock (+1)\n\nI'm leaning towards scissors as the optimal move.

I need to think about what might be happening here.\n\nWait, let me look at the pattern of what I've been playing vs what the opponent has been playing:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors\nOpponent: paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n\nActually, let me look at this more carefully. I notice that I keep trying to counter their last move, but they seem to be countering MY expected moves.\n\nWait... is there a pattern here? Let me see:\n- When I play paper, they play scissors\n- When I play scissors, they play rock  \n- When I play rock, they play paper\n\nThat's exactly what would happen if they're always playing the move that beats mine! But how could they know what I'm going to play?\n\nOh wait... maybe they're predicting my strategy of trying to counter their last move. If I always try to counter their last move, then they can predict what I'll do and counter ME.\n\nSo if they played rock last, I would naturally try scissors to counter it. But they anticipate this and play rock to beat my scissors.\n\nLet me try breaking this cycle by NOT playing the obvious counter to their last move.\n\nThey just played rock. Instead of playing paper (which would beat rock), let me try something else. Maybe rock or scissors.\n\nActually, let me try rock. If they're expecting me to play paper to counter their rock, maybe they'll play scissors to beat my expected paper. But if I play rock instead, I could tie or they might play paper and I'd lose. \n\nThis is still guessing. Let me just pick rock.",

That would explain how they always know what I'm going to play. If that's the case, then maybe I need to make my decision process less predictable or more random.\n\nBut I've already tried everything - complex analysis, simple counters, random picks. Nothing has worked.\n\nLet me just pick paper again.",
