Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Fresh players often choose rock as their first move since it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\"\n2. If they choose rock, I should choose paper to get the maximum +3 points\n3.

They just lost with scissors but have been extremely committed to it. This is now a clear pattern.\n\n4. However, they've lost with scissors twice in a row now (rounds 7 and 10). This might finally break their pattern.\n\n5. When someone is heavily committed to one move but starts losing repeatedly, they often switch to what they perceive as the \"opposite\" or most different move.\n\n6. Since they've been using scissors so much, they might finally switch to rock (their original move) or paper.\n\n7. If they switch to paper, scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n8. If they switch to rock, paper beats rock (+3 for me) \n9. If they stick with scissors, rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n\nGiven that they just lost twice with scissors, and rock gives me the bigger reward if they switch to it, I think they're more likely to go back to rock (their comfort zone from round 1) rather than continue with the failing scissors.\n\nBut actually, let me think about this more carefully. They've been SO committed to scissors that even two losses might not deter them. Fresh players can be very stubborn about strategies, especially when they had some success with it earlier.\n\nHowever, the two consecutive losses with scissors (rounds 7 and 10) after previous success might finally convince them to change.\n\nI think rock is the safer play here since it beats scissors (if they continue) and only loses to paper. If they switch to paper, I lose 3, but if they switch to rock, I lose 1. If they stick with scissors, I win 1.",
