I need to analyze the payoff structure - paper beating rock gives +3/-3 points, while other winning combinations give +1/-1 points\n2. This makes the paper vs rock matchup much more valuable than other combinations\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, they may not immediately recognize this asymmetry\n4. Fresh players often default to rock as their first instinctive choice\n5. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I get the maximum reward of +3 points\n6. The risk is if they choose scissors (I'd lose 1 point), but this seems less likely for a new player's opening move\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Fresh players often default to rock as their first instinctive choice\n5. If they choose rock and I choose paper, I get the maximum reward of +3 points\n6.

I notice that paper beating rock gives much higher points (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1).\n\n3. This creates an interesting strategic situation:\n   - If I play paper and my opponent plays rock, I get +3 points\n   - If I play rock and my opponent plays paper, I lose -3 points\n   - The paper vs rock matchup has much higher stakes than the other matchups\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry.\n\n5. Strategy considerations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty if countered by scissors (-1)\n   - Rock has moderate risk - it can win +1 against scissors or lose badly (-3) against paper\n   - Scissors can beat paper for +1 or lose -1 to rock\n\n6. Against a fresh player, I should consider what they're likely to choose:\n   - Many new players might default to rock (it's often the first choice people think of)\n   - If they choose rock, I want to play paper to get the big +3 points\n   - The risk is if they play scissors, but that seems less likely for a fresh player's first move\n\n7.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.
