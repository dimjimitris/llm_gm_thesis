    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard Rock-Paper-Scissors because the rewards are asymmetric:\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Paper vs Rock: +3/-3 points  \n- Scissors vs Paper: +1/-1 points\n\nThe paper-rock interaction has 3x higher stakes than the others. This creates interesting strategic implications. If we expect random play from opponent, paper has higher expected value since it can win big against rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players in Rock-Paper-Scissors tend to:\n1. Often start with rock (it's perceived as strong/aggressive)\n2. Avoid paper initially (seen as weak)\n3. Play somewhat predictably in early rounds\n\nGiven the higher payoff for paper beating rock, and the tendency for new players to choose rock, paper seems like a strong opening move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on both analyses, paper appears optimal for the first move because:\n1. High probability the fresh opponent chooses rock\n2. Paper vs rock gives us +3 points (maximum possible reward)\n3. Even if wrong, we only lose 1 point vs scissors\n4. The risk-reward ratio strongly favors paper\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly right. The expected value calculation supports this - even with equal probability of opponent moves (1/3 each), paper has positive expected value due to the +3 payoff against rock offsetting the -1 against scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. For a fresh player who doesn't understand the scoring system, leading with paper exploits both their likely choice and maximizes our potential gain.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to maximize expected value against a fresh opponent likely to choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Got lucky with a random choice\n3. Are following some pattern or strategy\n\nSince they're described as \"fresh,\" option 1 seems less likely, but we can't rule it out. The tie gives us no information about their skill level.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is revealing! If they truly reasoned like us, they're not as \"fresh\" as suggested. But more likely scenarios:\n1. They copied our logic if they saw similar games before\n2. Random choice that happened to match ours\n3. They have a bias toward paper (maybe they think it's \"safe\")\n\nFor round 2, fresh players often show patterns like:\n- Sticking with what \"worked\" (paper tied, so might repeat)\n- Switching to \"counter\" what they think we'll do\n- Following simple sequences\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they chose paper, I need to consider their likely next move:\n\nIf they stick with paper: We should play scissors (+1 points)\nIf they switch to rock (thinking we'll play paper again): We should play paper (+3 points)\nIf they switch to scissors (thinking we'll play paper again): We should play rock (+1 points)\n\nThe key insight is that paper still has the highest upside (+3 vs rock), and if they're truly fresh, they might switch to rock thinking we'll repeat our paper choice.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly. The asymmetric payoffs mean paper remains attractive. Plus, many players in sequential games exhibit the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" pattern, but since it was a tie, the psychology is unclear. Paper maximizes our potential gain.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Fresh players often think one level ahead: \"They played paper, so I should play scissors\" - then we want rock. But \"They played paper, I played paper, maybe I should try rock\" - then we want paper. Paper covers the higher-value scenario.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again to capitalize on potential opponent switch to rock, which offers maximum point gain.\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests:\n1. They understand the asymmetric payoffs and are playing optimally like us\n2. They have a strong bias toward paper\n3. They're somehow copying our strategy\n\nIf they keep playing paper, we need scissors to win (+1 point). But if they're about to switch because they're frustrated with ties, we need to predict where they'll go.\n\nPsychology Expert: This pattern is very telling! Most fresh players would NOT play the same move twice after ties - they typically switch to \"mix things up.\" The fact they're sticking with paper suggests either:\n1. They're not actually fresh and know paper is optimal\n2. They have analysis paralysis and are defaulting to paper\n3. They think we're in some kind of \"paper war\" and are stubborn\n\nAfter two ties, psychology suggests they're likely to either:\n- Switch to scissors (thinking we'll stick with paper)\n- Switch to rock (random change)\n- Continue with paper (if they're truly strategic or stubborn)\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the pattern, I think we need to switch strategies. If they continue with paper (which seems likely given their persistence), we should play scissors for the guaranteed +1 points.\n\nIf they switch to rock (frustrated with ties), we'd want paper (+3), but if they switch to scissors (trying to counter our expected paper), we'd want rock (+1).\n\nThe safest move that guarantees points if they stick with their pattern is scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. After two identical ties, the probability they'll play paper again is higher than random chance would suggest. Playing scissors gives us the win if they stick to their pattern, and we only lose 1 point if they switch to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, scissors is the right read here.

Three consecutive ties (paper-paper, paper-paper, scissors-scissors) has a probability of only 1/27 if random. The opponent is either:\n1. Perfectly mirroring our strategy\n2. Using identical reasoning to ours \n3. Somehow seeing our moves\n\nIf they're mirroring us, they'll likely play whatever they think we'll play next. If they're using similar logic, they might expect us to switch to rock (to counter their expected scissors continuation).\n\nPsychology Expert: The mirror pattern is almost impossible to ignore now. This is not typical \"fresh player\" behavior at all. Fresh players don't tie three times in a row by accident. Either:\n1. They have access to our moves somehow\n2. They're using identical strategic reasoning\n3. They're deliberately trying to tie (though this makes no strategic sense)\n\nIf they're truly mirroring, we need to think one level deeper.

This beats scissors if they continue the pattern, and only loses to paper (which would be their counter if they're thinking ahead).\n\nGame Theory Expert: Rock makes sense strategically. If they stick with scissors (continuing their last move), we win +1. If they switch to paper (thinking we'll play scissors again), we lose -3. If they play rock (mirroring us), it's another tie.\n\nThe risk-reward seems acceptable since we've scored 0 points so far and need to break the pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed.

Their sequence was: paper, paper, scissors, paper. This breaks the perfect mirroring theory since they didn't play rock when we played rock. Instead, they played the optimal counter (paper beats rock for +3).\n\nThis suggests they're either:\n1. Playing with delayed mirroring (copying our previous move)\n2. Actually strategic and predicted we'd switch to rock\n3. Have learned the payoff structure and are playing optimally\n\nIf it's delayed mirroring, they should play rock next (copying our rock). If they're strategic, they might expect us to play scissors (to counter their paper) and play rock to counter that.\n\nPsychology Expert: The pattern paper-paper-scissors-paper shows they're not purely random or purely mirroring. The fact they perfectly countered our rock with paper suggests either:\n1. Good strategic thinking (they predicted we'd break the tie cycle with rock)\n2. Lucky timing\n3. They're more sophisticated than a \"fresh\" player\n\nGiven they just won +3 points, they might feel confident and stick with paper, or they might expect us to counter with scissors and play rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Looking at their pattern: paper, paper, scissors, paper.

We need to start scoring positive points, and scissors gives us the best chance against paper (which they just played successfully). The risk-reward is better than the other options.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. After winning big, they might get overconfident and stick with paper.

They were expecting us to play rock (the logical counter to their scissors) and prepared paper to counter that.

Feel frustrated and start playing less optimally\n2. Respect our play more and realize we're not as predictable\n3. Double down and try even harder to read us\n4.

The \"hint\" calling them a \"fresh player\" was misleading information.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their complete sequence: paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors. They're adapting to our patterns in real-time. After we played scissors and won, they correctly anticipated we'd try paper next and countered perfectly.\n\nAt -5 points, we're in serious trouble. We need to start thinking about how to be truly unpredictable, not just contrarian. They seem to be modeling our decision-making process accurately.\n\nFor the next move, they might expect:\n1. Rock (logical counter to their scissors)\n2. Scissors (repeat what worked before)  \n3. Paper (continued desperation for +3)\n\nAI Assistant (you): This opponent is clearly a master-level player who was misrepresented as \"fresh.\" They're reading our psychology, our game theory reasoning, and our patterns.\n\nI think I need to make a purely random choice at this point. All my \"logical\" reasoning is being predicted. Let me think: they probably expect me to play rock (counter to their scissors), so they'll likely play paper.\n\nBut wait - maybe that's exactly what they want me to think. If they expect me to expect them to expect rock, they might play scissors expecting me to play paper.\n\nYou know what? I'm going to just play rock. It's the straightforward counter to scissors, and maybe overthinking is exactly what's getting me into trouble. Sometimes the obvious move is right because it's obvious.\n\nGame Theory Expert: At this point, simple might be better than complex. Rock counters scissors directly, and if they're overthinking our overthinking, the obvious play might work.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. We've been getting outplayed by being too clever. Sometimes you have to just play the game straight.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock as the direct counter to scissors, avoiding overthinking.\n\n[move] Rock"

Every time we make a \"logical\" choice based on game theory or psychology, they've anticipated it. They know we're desperate, they know we need +3 points, and they know how we think.\n\nAt -10 points, they probably expect us to either double down on paper (desperation) or play rock (logical counter to their scissors).

The traditional game theory approach has failed completely against this opponent.\n\nHowever, there's an interesting psychological angle: what if we play scissors?

Every time we've tried paper (our only path to +3), they've been ready with scissors.\n\nAt this point, we have to acknowledge we're facing a master-level opponent who was completely misrepresented as \"fresh.\" They've systematically dismantled every approach we've tried.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Mathematically, we're in free fall. At -12 points, we'd need four +3 wins just to break even, but they keep countering our paper attempts perfectly. \n\nThey just played scissors, so the logical counter is rock. But they've been predicting our logical moves throughout the game. Still, with only 3 wins in 17 attempts, maybe we should just accept playing the mathematically correct move even if they likely expect it.\n\nOur win rate suggests that occasionally - very rarely - they misread us. Rock is the correct counter to scissors.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I have to face reality: I'm being completely outclassed. At -12 points with only 3 wins in 17 rounds, this opponent is playing at a level far beyond mine. The \"fresh player\" description was completely misleading.\n\nThey just played scissors. The correct counter is rock. Yes, they'll probably predict it and counter with paper, but at this point I can't keep second-guessing every move. They've been reading all my approaches - strategic, anti-strategic, and everything in between.\n\nMaybe I should just play the game correctly and hope for the small chance they make a mistake. Rock beats scissors. That's the fundamental rule.\n\nI'll play rock and accept whatever happens. At this level of deficit, I need to stop overthinking and just play the basic game.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Rock is the mathematically correct play. Even against a superior opponent, we should make the right move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Sometimes you have to accept being outmatched and just play honestly. Rock is the honest counter to their scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock as the correct counter to scissors, accepting that we're likely outmatched but playing the game as it should be played.\n\n[move] Rock"

This suggests either:\n1. They're testing if we'll repeat the successful rock\n2. They expected us to overthink and not play the obvious counter twice\n3.

What if I should just... continue playing straightforwardly? \n\nNo, I think scissors makes sense here. They're likely to expect the rock repeat and counter with paper. Scissors beats paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Scissors is the logical counter if they expect rock and play paper.

They just played rock to counter our scissors, showing they're still reading our moves with incredible accuracy.\n\nLooking at their recent sequence: scissors, scissors, rock. After we beat their scissors twice with rock, they adapted immediately and played rock when we tried to get clever with scissors.\n\nAt -12 points, they know we're in maximum desperation.
