Analyze the payoff matrix: Paper beating rock gives +3/-3 points, while other wins only give +1/-1 points. This creates an asymmetric reward structure.\n\n2. Consider my opponent: They're described as a \"fresh player,\" meaning I have no information about their playing patterns.\n\n3. Evaluate risk vs reward for each move:\n   - Paper: High reward potential (+3 vs rock), moderate risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Rock: Low reward (+1 vs scissors), high risk (-3 vs paper)  \n   - Scissors: Low reward (+1 vs paper), low risk (-1 vs rock)\n\n4. Consider common first-move tendencies: Many new players have a slight bias toward playing rock initially.\n\n5.

Let me understand the payoff structure first:\n\n- Rock beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Paper beats Rock: Winner gets +3, Loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nThis is interesting - paper beating rock gives much higher rewards/penalties (3 points) compared to the other winning combinations (1 point each).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" I don't have any information about their playing patterns or tendencies. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to play randomly with equal probability for each move, since any predictable pattern can be exploited.\n\nHowever, the asymmetric payoff structure changes things. Let me think about this:\n\nIf I play paper:\n- I win big (+3) if opponent plays rock\n- I lose small (-1) if opponent plays scissors  \n- I tie (0) if opponent plays paper\n\nIf I play rock:\n- I win small (+1) if opponent plays scissors\n- I lose big (-3) if opponent plays paper\n- I tie (0) if opponent plays rock\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- I win small (+1) if opponent plays paper\n- I lose small (-1) if opponent plays rock\n- I tie (0) if opponent plays scissors\n\nFrom a risk-reward perspective:\n- Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also a moderate risk (-1)\n- Rock has low reward (+1) but very high risk (-3)\n- Scissors has low reward (+1) and low risk (-1)\n\nGiven that this is against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about the asymmetric payoff structure, they might play randomly or have some natural bias. Many people have a slight tendency to play rock first in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high reward for paper beating rock, and the relatively low penalty if paper loses to scissors, paper seems like a good strategic choice for the first move against an unknown opponent.",

If they think I think they'll switch to paper, they might go back to scissors\n\nThis is getting into mind games. Let me think about the most rational approach:\n\n- Many players have a tendency to either repeat a winning move or switch after winning\n- Since scissors worked, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with it\n- Rock would beat scissors and give me +1 points\n- The risk is if they switch to paper, I'd lose -3 points\n\nGiven that paper has such a high penalty when it loses to scissors (-1) but such a high reward when it beats rock (+3), and rock has a low reward when it beats scissors (+1) but high penalty when it loses to paper (-3), scissors seems like the most balanced choice:\n- Scissors beats paper for +1\n- Scissors loses to rock for -1\n- Balanced risk/reward\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. If I think they might stick with scissors, then rock is the clear choice for +1. The question is how likely they are to switch to paper.\n\nI think I'll go with rock, betting that they either stick with scissors or don't anticipate my counter-move.",

Consider their likely next move after losing to my scissors:\n   - They'll probably anticipate I'll repeat scissors (since it just won)\n   - If they expect my scissors, they'll likely counter with rock\n   - Less likely to continue paper immediately after being beaten by scissors\n\n4. Evaluate strategic recovery options:\n   - If they counter my expected scissors with rock: Paper wins me +3 (brings me to -7, significant recovery)\n   - If they repeat paper: Scissors wins me +1 (brings me to -9)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock wins me +1 (brings me to -9)\n\n5.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Many new players tend to default to rock as their first move, making paper a strong strategic choice.\n\n5. Even against random play, paper has the best expected value of the three options.\n\n6. The objective is to maximize points, so I should take the move with the highest potential upside while the risk is manageable.\n\n[move] (It offers the best combination of high reward potential and strategic advantage against a new player who might default to rock) paper",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, they likely don't understand this asymmetric payoff structure yet.\n\n3. Fresh players often default to rock as their first move, as it's a common instinctive choice.\n\n4. If I play paper against their likely rock choice, I get the maximum possible points (+3).\n\n5. Even if they don't play rock, my worst case is losing 1 point (if they play scissors), but the potential gain of +3 points makes this a favorable risk.\n\n6. The high-value paper vs rock dynamic should be my priority in this opening move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup and take advantage of a fresh player's likely rock choice.\n\n[move] paper",

Paper beating rock gives much higher points (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1)\n2. This creates an asymmetric payoff structure where paper vs rock has higher stakes\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", they likely don't know about this asymmetry yet\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1.

If they're truly fresh, they probably won't expect me to immediately go for the high-value play.\n\nMy reasoning:\n1. Fresh players often default to rock\n2.
