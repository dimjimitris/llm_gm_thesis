Paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n2. Rock and Scissors both have moderate rewards (+1) and penalties (-1)\n3. Against a \"fresh player\" (new/inexperienced), I need to think about what they might choose\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for new players (it's solid, strong)\n- If I expect them to play Rock, then Paper would give me +3 points\n- However, if they think I expect them to play Rock and they play Scissors instead, then Paper would lose me -1 points\n- Playing Rock would be safe against Scissors (+1) but lose badly to Paper (-3)\n- Playing Scissors would beat Paper (+1) but lose to Rock (-1)\n \nI'm leaning towards Paper as my first move. The probability of gaining +3 points by catching a new player's likely Rock choice seems strategically sound. While there's a small risk of losing -1 points to Scissors, the potential high reward makes Paper the most attractive initial strategy.",
