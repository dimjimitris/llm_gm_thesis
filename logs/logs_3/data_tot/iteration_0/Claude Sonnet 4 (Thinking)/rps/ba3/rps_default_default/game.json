But they might anticipate this and choose scissors to beat my paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock (to beat scissors, thinking they'll try to beat my previous paper), then I should choose paper again.\n\nRock might be a good choice if they stick with paper or if they choose scissors thinking I'll use paper again.\n\nLet me go with rock this time - it beats scissors for 1 point, and if they're trying to counter my previous paper choice with scissors, I'll win. If they stick with paper, I lose 3 points, but if they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. The payoff matrix shows:\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1\n\nGiven that paper has the highest reward when it wins, but also the highest penalty when it loses, it's a high-risk high-reward choice.
