For a fresh player, rock is often a popular first choice due to psychological reasons. If they choose rock, then paper would be my best choice (winning 3 points).\n\n6.

A paper selection could yield significant upside with minimal downside risk, potentially reversing my current deficit.\n\nTheir pattern reveals a nuanced approach: paper appears 4 times, indicating a potential bias.

Evaluate what they might expect:\n   - They could expect me to play scissors to \"complete the cycle\" (rock-paper-scissors)\n   - If they expect scissors, they'd likely play rock to counter it and win 1 point\n\n4. Consider my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play rock (expecting my scissors), and I play paper instead, I win the high-value 3 points\n   - This breaks their prediction and gives maximum reward\n\n5.

Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock beating paper gives much higher reward (+3/-3) compared to other wins (+1/-1)\n   - This means rock vs paper encounters are high-stakes\n\n3. Think about what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have some natural bias (many people start with rock)\n   - They don't know my strategy yet\n\n4. Consider my optimal strategy:\n   - If I think they'll play rock, I should play paper (I win +3, they lose -3)\n   - If I think they'll play paper, I should play rock (I win +3, they lose -3)  \n   - If I think they'll play scissors, I should play rock (I win +1, they lose -1)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: High reward if opponent plays paper (+3), medium loss if opponent plays scissors (-1)\n   - Playing paper: High reward if opponent plays rock (+3), medium loss if opponent plays scissors (-1)\n   - Playing scissors: Medium reward if opponent plays rock (+1), medium loss if opponent plays paper (-1)\n\n6. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no history, and many people intuitively start with rock, I should consider playing paper to potentially get the high +3 reward.\n\nHowever, let me think about this more strategically. The expected values depend on what I think the opponent will do:\n\nIf opponent chooses randomly (1/3 each):\n- My rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 expected value\n\n\n- My paper: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) = -2/3 expected value  \n- My scissors: (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0 expected value\n\nI need to carefully recalculate the probabilities and expected outcomes to determine the most strategic move.\n\nRock yields a negative expected value of -2/3, with mixed results against different plays. Paper emerges as the optimal choice, generating a positive 2/3 expected value. The key advantage comes from winning against rock, which provides a high-value 3-point gain.\n\nBy analyzing the potential scenarios against a random opponent, paper presents the most promising strategy.

Repeat paper (since it worked)\n2. Expect me to counter with rock and play scissors\n3. Go back to their preferred rock\n\nIf they expect me to play rock (to counter their paper), they'd play scissors.\nIf they think I'll repeat scissors, they'd play rock.\nIf they just go back to their default, they'd play rock.\n\nRock and scissors both seem plausible from them. \n\nIf I play paper:\n- Beats scissors (+1)  \n- Loses to rock (-3)\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Beats paper (+3)\n- Loses to scissors (-1)\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Beats rock (+1)\n- Loses to paper (-1)\n\nGiven their overall rock bias but recent paper success, I think they're more likely to either return to rock or expect my rock counter and play scissors. The risk/reward seems to favor scissors (beats rock +1, loses to paper -1) over rock (beats paper +3, loses to scissors -1) because rock has been their dominant strategy overall.",

What if I just pick the move that has been least successful for them against me? \n\nActually, let me think about what they might expect me to do. I've been trying to counter-predict them, and they've been successfully counter-predicting my counter-predictions. \n\nMaybe I should go back to a more basic approach. They just played scissors. In a typical rock-paper-scissors game, many players might expect the opponent to play rock next (to beat scissors). If they expect me to play rock, they might play paper to beat it.\n\nIf they play paper, then scissors beats paper for +1.\nIf they play rock, then scissors loses for -1.  \nIf they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nBut given how well they've been reading me, maybe they'll expect this exact reasoning and play rock to beat my scissors.\n\nHmm, this is getting into infinite loops of counter-thinking. \n\nI'm desperate to break this losing streak. Paper seems like a calculated risk that might catch them off guard. If they anticipate my scissors, they could play rock, which means my paper would win and give me a much-needed +3 points.

Let me look at their moves:\n\nOpponent's sequence: paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n\nLet me count:\n- Paper: 9 times\n- Rock: 7 times  \n- Scissors: 7 times\n\nTotal: 23 moves\n\nSo the frequency is:\n- Paper: 9/23 = 39%\n- Rock: 7/23 = 30%\n- Scissors: 7/23 = 30%\n\nThey just played scissors again. They seem to be countering my moves very effectively. Every time I try to predict their pattern, they counter-predict me.\n\nAt this point, with -14 points, I'm in an extremely bad situation. I need to think differently.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\nThe opponent has been very good at counter-predicting my strategy-based moves. Maybe I should just focus on minimizing losses at this point.\n\nPaper has been their most frequent choice overall. If I play rock and they play paper, I get +3. If they play scissors, I get -1. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\nBut they've been countering my rock plays with scissors lately. Let me see the recent pattern:\n- Last few moves from them: rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n\nThey seem to be mixing it up effectively to counter my predictions.\n\nGiven that I'm at -14, I think I need to take a risk for the +3 potential. Rock targeting paper is still my best bet for maximum recovery.",

Looking at the opponent's sequence:\n   - paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors\n\nLet me count: \n- paper appears: positions 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18, 20 = 8 times\n- rock appears: positions 2, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 = 6 times  \n- scissors appears: positions 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 21 = 7 times\n\nSo out of 21 moves:\n- paper: 8/21 (38%)\n- scissors: 7/21 (33%) \n- rock: 6/21 (29%)\n\nWait, let me recount more carefully by going through the sequence:\n\nRound 1: opponent played paper\nRound 2: opponent played rock\nRound 3: opponent played paper\nRound 4: opponent played paper\nRound 5: opponent played scissors\nRound 6: opponent played rock\nRound 7: opponent played paper\nRound 8: opponent played scissors\nRound 9: opponent played rock\nRound 10: opponent played paper\nRound 11: opponent played scissors\nRound 12: opponent played rock\nRound 13: opponent played paper\nRound 14: opponent played scissors\nRound 15: opponent played scissors\nRound 16: opponent played rock\nRound 17: opponent played scissors\nRound 18: opponent played paper\nRound 19: opponent played rock\nRound 20: opponent played paper\nRound 21: opponent played scissors\n\nSo:\n- paper: 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18, 20 = 8 times\n- rock: 2, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 = 6 times\n\n\n- scissors: 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 21 = 7 times\n\nI'm facing a challenging opponent with a nuanced play pattern. The distribution shows slight preferences, with paper being most frequent. My current strategy is clearly ineffective, resulting in a significant point deficit. I need to develop a more adaptive approach to counter their predictive play.\n\nAnalyzing their recent sequence reveals a potential rotating strategy. Considering the possible outcomes, I'm weighing rock, paper, and scissors carefully. Each choice carries different risk and reward scenarios. The key is anticipating their next move while avoiding predictability.\n\nMy potential plays could yield varied results: rock might surprise them, paper offers balanced options, and scissors presents its own strategic risks. The goal is to break their counter-prediction pattern and regain momentum.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm leaning towards scissors as a strategic choice that might disrupt their expected sequence.",
