Examining their historical pattern after playing scissors throughout the entire game: they've gone to paper approximately 8 out of 10 times after scissors (80% frequency).\n\n3. This is their most reliable transition - scissors \u2192 paper occurs consistently with very few exceptions.\n\n4. If they play paper (their dominant post-scissors move): I need scissors (+1 point)\n5. If they repeat scissors: I need rock (+3 points)\n6. If they try rock: I need scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Scissors provides guaranteed positive results (+1) against both paper and rock, with paper being highly probable based on their 80% pattern.\n\n8. With such a strong scissors \u2192 paper tendency, scissors is the optimal choice for reliable positive value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors capitalizes on their dominant scissors \u2192 paper pattern for consistent positive reward.\n\n[move] Scissors",
