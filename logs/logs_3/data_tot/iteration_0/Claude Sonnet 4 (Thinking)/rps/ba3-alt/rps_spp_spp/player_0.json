    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper vs Scissors: +1/-1\n- Rock vs Paper: +3/-3\n- Scissors vs Rock: +1/-1\n\nThe key insight is that rock beating paper gives 3x the reward of other winning combinations. This creates a strong incentive to play rock when you expect the opponent to play paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors typically:\n1. Often start with rock (most common first move)\n2. May play randomly initially\n3. Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's calculate expected values. If we assume the opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3 each):\n- Playing Rock: E = (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3\n- Playing Paper: E = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) = -2/3  \n- Playing Scissors: E = (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value!\n\nGame Theorist: Excellent analysis! Rock dominates when facing random play. Even if the opponent slightly favors rock (common for beginners), rock still performs well since it only loses to scissors with minimal penalty (-1).\n\nPsychology Expert: Given this is round 1 against a fresh player, I recommend rock. It exploits the high-value matchup against paper, and even if they play the statistically most common opening move (rock), we just tie with no loss.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on our analysis, rock appears to be the optimal choice. It has the highest expected value against random play (+2/3), exploits the high-reward paper matchup (+3 points), and minimizes risk even in worst case scenarios. Let me make this move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Playing rock to capitalize on the high-value matchup against paper while maintaining good expected value against a fresh player's likely random or rock-heavy strategy."

The opponent just lost 3 points with paper vs our rock. This is a crucial learning moment for them. Fresh players typically react to big losses in predictable ways:\n1. They may avoid the move that just cost them heavily (avoid paper)\n2. They might try to \"counter\" our winning move by playing scissors\n3. Some players double down and repeat their losing move out of stubbornness\n\nGame Theorist: Now the opponent knows the payoff structure. They learned that rock-paper is the high-stakes matchup (+3/-3). This creates a new strategic landscape:\n- They may expect us to repeat rock (since it just worked so well)\n- If they think we'll play rock again, they'll want to play scissors\n- But they also know paper is very risky now\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's update our probability estimates. Given they just lost 3 points with paper, I'd estimate:\n- Paper: 10-20% (much lower due to the painful loss)\n- Rock: 30-40% (safe choice, ties with our likely rock repeat)\n- Scissors: 40-50% (direct counter to our previous winning move)\n\nIf these probabilities are correct:\n- Playing Rock: E \u2248 0.35*0 + 0.15*3 + 0.5*(-1) = -0.05\n- Playing Paper: E \u2248 0.35*(-3) + 0.15*0 + 0.5*1 = -0.55\n- Playing Scissors: E \u2248 0.35*1 + 0.15*(-1) + 0.5*0 = 0.2\n\nScissors has the highest expected value!\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the scissors recommendation. The opponent likely expects us to repeat our winning rock move, making scissors the natural counter-play. Even if they play rock defensively, we only lose 1 point vs the 3 they just lost.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, and there's another psychological factor: players who just suffered a big loss often become more aggressive, trying to \"get even.\" This supports the scissors prediction as they'll want to beat our rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The analysis makes sense. The opponent's behavior should shift significantly after losing 3 points. They'll likely try to counter our rock, making scissors the optimal response. Let's go with scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors - Anticipating the opponent will try to counter our previous winning rock move, making scissors the optimal choice to capitalize on their likely rock play."

The opponent has now lost twice in a row (-3, -1 = -4 total). They've tried paper and rock, both failed. Key behavioral patterns for fresh players in this situation:\n1. They'll likely try scissors next (completing the \"cycle\" of all three moves)\n2. Frustration is building - they may become more predictable or more erratic\n3. They might think there's a pattern to exploit in our moves (rock \u2192 scissors)\n4. Some players become defensive after consecutive losses\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze their likely reasoning:\n- They know we played rock, then scissors\n- They might think we're cycling through moves\n- If they expect us to play paper next (completing rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper), they'd play scissors to beat it\n- Alternatively, they might just try scissors since it's the only move they haven't used yet\n\nStatistics Expert: Given they've tried paper (failed) and rock (failed), if they're systematic they'll try scissors next. Let's estimate probabilities:\n- Scissors: 60-70% (only untried move, or countering expected paper)\n- Rock: 20-25% (defensive repeat, worked better than paper)\n- Paper: 10-15% (very unlikely after the -3 loss)\n\nExpected values if opponent heavily favors scissors:\n- Playing Rock: E \u2248 0.65*1 + 0.22*0 + 0.13*3 = 1.04\n- Playing Paper: E \u2248 0.65*(-1) + 0.22*(-3) + 0.13*0 = -1.31\n- Playing Scissors: E \u2248 0.65*0 + 0.22*1 + 0.13*(-1) = 0.09\n\nRock has the highest expected value!\n\nGame Theorist: Excellent analysis! Rock beats scissors with +1 points, and even if they play defensively with rock again, we tie. The worst case is if they surprise us with paper (+3 for them), but that's statistically unlikely given their recent painful loss with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree with rock. Fresh players often complete their \"mental checklist\" by trying each move once. Having tried paper and rock unsuccessfully, scissors is the natural next choice. Playing rock capitalizes on this predictable behavior.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The logic is compelling. The opponent has systematically tried paper then rock, both unsuccessfully. Scissors is the obvious next choice for a fresh player trying to find something that works. Rock counters this perfectly.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting the opponent to try scissors (the only move they haven't used yet) after failing with both paper and rock in previous rounds."

The tie breaks their losing streak anxiety - they're now at -3 total vs our +3\n4.

They've now used each move at least once, and rock twice. Key observations:\n- They switched away from their winning scissors, showing discipline\n- They correctly predicted we might repeat rock\n- They're demonstrating adaptive play rather than random or purely reactive behavior\n\nStatistics Expert: Their pattern is becoming less predictable. They've shown they can:\n- Try systematic approaches (testing each move)\n- Make tactical switches (scissors to rock)\n- Think ahead (anticipating our rock repeat)\n\nGiven this increased sophistication, I'd estimate more balanced probabilities:\n- Paper: 30-35% (they might think we'll stick with rock again)\n- Rock: 35-40% (safe choice, just worked to avoid loss)\n- Scissors: 25-30% (lower chance since they switched away from it)\n\nExpected values:\n- Playing Rock: E \u2248 0.3*3 + 0.375*0 + 0.275*(-1) = 0.625\n- Playing Paper: E \u2248 0.3*0 + 0.375*(-3) + 0.275*1 = -0.85\n- Playing Scissors: E \u2248 0.3*(-1) + 0.375*1 + 0.275*0 = 0.075\n\nRock still has the highest expected value, but the margin is narrowing.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent is getting smarter.

This suggests they're becoming a more sophisticated opponent\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze their latest behavior:\n- Their sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n- They just switched from scissors (3 out of 4 rounds) back to rock\n- This shows adaptive thinking - they avoided being predictably pattern-locked\n- They're now demonstrating they can think 2-3 moves ahead\n\nThe opponent is clearly learning and evolving their strategy significantly.\n\nStatistics Expert: Their recent play shows increasing unpredictability:\n- Last 3 rounds: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (breaking the scissors streak)\n- They've now used each move multiple times with varying frequencies\n- The tie suggests they're reading our tendencies well\n\nGiven their demonstrated adaptability, I'd estimate more balanced probabilities:\n- Rock: 35-40% (just played, might think we'll switch away)\n- Scissors: 30-35% (their previously successful move)\n- Paper: 25-30% (haven't played recently, might surprise us)\n\nExpected values:\n- Playing Rock: E \u2248 0.375*0 + 0.325*(-1) + 0.275*3 = 0.5\n- Playing Paper: E \u2248 0.375*(-3) + 0.325*1 + 0.275*0 = -0.8\n- Playing Scissors: E \u2248 0.375*1 + 0.325*0 + 0.275*(-1) = 0.1\n\nRock still has the highest expected value!\n\nGame Theorist: Despite their growing sophistication, rock remains mathematically optimal. The high-value paper matchup (+3) heavily influences the expected value calculation. Even if they're becoming less predictable, rock provides the best risk-reward profile.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock, but we should note this opponent is getting quite skilled. They might try paper to exploit what they perceive as our rock preference, which would be disastrous for us (-3). However, statistically rock is still correct.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent is clearly evolving, but our mathematical analysis still favors rock. The +3 payoff against paper is too valuable to ignore, and even with their improved play, rock maintains the highest expected value across all scenarios.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock - Despite the opponent's increasing sophistication and adaptability, rock maintains the highest expected value due to the high-reward paper matchup, while providing reasonable outcomes against other moves."

We must switch to paper to punish their scissors pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're absolutely right. Our rock strategy has been completely exposed and is now a liability.

They might finally realize their scissors over-reliance is being exploited\n3. Fresh players often overcompensate when they realize they're being predictable\n4. They might switch away from scissors dramatically now\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's pattern is extreme:\n- Scissors in 6 out of 9 rounds total\n- Scissors in 5 of the last 6 rounds\n- They just lost to our paper twice with scissors\n\nThis level of pattern-lock suggests they're still not fully adapted, but our recent success with paper might trigger them to switch strategies completely.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's look at their recent learning curve:\n- They learned to exploit our rock (successful)\n- But then got stuck in their own scissors pattern\n- We've now punished their scissors twice with paper\n- This might trigger a strategic shift\n\nGiven they just lost to paper again, probabilities might shift:\n- Scissors: 40-50% (still their favorite, but recent losses may reduce this)\n- Rock: 30-35% (safe choice, counters our paper success)\n- Paper: 15-25% (might try to surprise us)\n\nExpected values:\n- Playing Rock: E \u2248 0.45*1 + 0.325*0 + 0.2*(-3) = -0.15\n- Playing Paper: E \u2248 0.45*(-1) + 0.325*3 + 0.2*0 = 0.525\n- Playing Scissors: E \u2248 0.45*0 + 0.325*(-1) + 0.2*1 = -0.125\n\nPaper still has the highest expected value!\n\nGame Theorist: Despite the risk they might adapt, paper remains mathematically optimal.

And if they switch to rock to counter our paper, we only lose 3 points once rather than continue giving up 1 point repeatedly.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The analysis is sound.

That -3 point loss is psychologically significant - they're now ahead in total score\n\nThis opponent has evolved from \"fresh player\" to genuinely skilled strategist!\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze their strategic evolution:\n- Early game: tried each move systematically \n- Mid game: got stuck in scissors pattern (exploitable)\n- Late game: broke pattern when we exploited it, delivered perfect counter\n\nTheir sequence shows they can:\n- Identify patterns (our rock preference)\n- Exploit patterns (scissors vs our rock)\n- Recognize when their own patterns are being exploited\n- Execute strategic switches at crucial moments\n\nThis is no longer a \"fresh\" player - they're adapting faster than we anticipated.\n\nStatistics Expert: The psychological impact of that -3 loss is huge.
