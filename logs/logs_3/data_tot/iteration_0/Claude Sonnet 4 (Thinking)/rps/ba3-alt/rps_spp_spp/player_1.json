    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors due to asymmetric payoffs:\n- If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I lose 3 points\n- If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win 3 points  \n- If I play scissors and opponent plays rock: I lose 1 point\n- If I play rock and opponent plays scissors: I win 1 point\n- If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose 1 point\n- If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win 1 point\n\nThe key insight is that rock vs paper has much higher stakes (\u00b13) compared to other matchups (\u00b11).\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is described as a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. Fresh players often default to rock as their first move - it's psychologically the most \"solid\" choice. However, some might overthink and go with scissors thinking others expect rock.\n\nStatistics Expert: In a single-round game against an unknown opponent, we need to consider the expected value of each move:\n- If opponent plays each move with equal probability (1/3 each):\n  - Rock: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3 points expected\n  - Paper: (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = -2/3 points expected  \n  - Scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 0 points expected\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on this analysis, rock has the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly. However, should we consider that a fresh player might not play randomly?\n\nPsychology Expert: Fresh players tend to have biases. Rock is often the default first choice due to its perceived strength. If that's the case, playing paper would give us +3 points. But there's also the \"I know they expect rock, so I'll play scissors\" meta-thinking.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the high reward for paper beating rock (+3) versus the moderate penalty for rock beating paper (-3), and considering fresh player psychology tends toward rock, I believe paper is our best strategic choice here.\n\nStatistics Expert: I agree. Even if there's only a 40% chance they play rock, the expected value of paper would be: 0.4*3 + 0.3*(-1) + 0.3*0 = 0.9 points, which is still positive and higher than rock's expected value under most reasonable probability distributions.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The analysis is convincing. Paper maximizes our expected return against a fresh player who is likely to default to rock, and even if they don't, the potential +3 reward outweighs the risks.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n\n[move] Based on game theory analysis and fresh player psychology, paper offers the best expected value against a new opponent who is likely to choose rock as their default first move.\n"

The opponent did play rock as we predicted, but I made an error in my previous payoff analysis. Let me recalculate correctly:\n- Paper vs Rock: Rock beats paper, so I lose 3 points (which happened)\n- Rock vs Paper: Rock beats paper, so I win 3 points  \n- Scissors vs Rock: Scissors beats rock, so I win 1 point\n\nIf opponent plays randomly (1/3 each):\n- Rock expected value: (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) = +2/3\n- Paper expected value: (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = -2/3\n- Scissors expected value: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\nSo rock has the highest expected value against random play.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent played rock in round 1, confirming the fresh player tendency. But now they know I played paper. They might think:\n1. \"They played paper, so they might expect me to play rock again, so I should switch\"\n2. \"Rock worked, so I'll stick with it\"\n3. \"They'll expect me to switch, so I'll actually stick with rock\"\n\nStatistics Expert: With only one data point, we can't establish a strong pattern. However, if they're truly a fresh player, they might not have sophisticated counter-strategies yet. They could stick with what worked (rock) or randomly change.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given that rock has the highest expected value overall, and we have limited information about opponent patterns, rock seems like our safest bet. Even if they switch to paper, we only lose 3 points, but if they stick with rock or play scissors, we either tie or win.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The analysis shows rock is mathematically optimal against random play, and psychologically reasonable given the limited information we have about this opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Rock has the highest expected value and hedges against various opponent strategies after their round 1 rock play) rock"

(possibly paper to complete the cycle)\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent showed they can adapt. They switched from rock to scissors after seeing my paper. This suggests they're not just a random player but someone thinking strategically. If they're following a rock-scissors-paper rotation, they'd play paper next.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's think about this differently. They've now played rock and scissors. If they play paper next (completing the cycle), I should play scissors to win 1 point. But they might also be thinking about what I'm thinking - classic game theory recursion. \n\nHowever, let's also consider they might repeat scissors since it just worked, or go back to rock. Against scissors, I'd want rock. Against rock, I'd want scissors (since scissors beats rock for +1).\n\nAI Assistant (you): Wait, I need to double-check the rules. Let me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So scissors beating rock gives scissors player +1 and rock player -1. That matches what happened when I played rock and they played scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given the potential cycle pattern (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper), and the fact that playing scissors against paper would give us +1 points, scissors seems like the strategic choice. Even if they don't follow the pattern, scissors has decent expected value.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. If they play paper (completing the cycle), scissors wins us 1 point.

If they continue alternating, they'd play scissors next.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent seems to be switching between rock and scissors, possibly avoiding paper entirely.

The alternating pattern broke when they played rock twice consecutively. This suggests they might be favoring rock or reacting to my successful scissors play in round 3.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent broke their alternating pattern by playing rock again. This could mean:\n1. They're gravitating back to rock as their \"comfort\" move\n2. They noticed my scissors won last time and want to counter it with rock\n3. They're becoming less predictable\n4.

After successfully using paper, they reverted back to rock - their dominant pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is telling behavior. They successfully broke their pattern with paper (which worked), but then immediately went back to rock. This suggests:\n1. Rock is their true \"comfort zone\" move\n2. The paper was a tactical adaptation, not a permanent strategy shift\n3. They might be second-guessing whether to diversify or stick with what usually works for them\n4. They could be in a psychological tug-of-war between pattern-breaking and pattern-following\n\nGame Theory Expert: The reversion to rock after the successful paper play is interesting. It suggests they view paper as a situational counter rather than a primary strategy. Given their strong rock tendency (71% frequency), they're likely to continue favoring rock.\n\nHowever, they've now shown they CAN and WILL adapt when needed. This makes them more dangerous but also means their rock bias is still exploitable.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent demonstrated adaptability with paper but immediately returned to their rock comfort zone. This suggests rock remains their preferred move, making scissors still our best counter statistically.\n\nStatistics Expert: Exactly. Despite the one-time paper adaptation, their 71% rock frequency suggests scissors continues to have the highest expected value against their likely behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Despite showing adaptability with paper, opponent immediately reverted to rock indicating it remains their preferred strategy, so scissors continues to be optimal) scissors"

The rock bias is getting even stronger, and they've now reverted to rock twice after their strategic deviations.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent has a very clear psychological profile now. They have a dominant rock preference but can make tactical adaptations when necessary. However, they always return to rock afterward, suggesting it's their true strategic anchor. \n\nThe pattern shows: comfort with rock \u2192 occasional strategic deviation \u2192 immediate return to rock. They're predictable in their unpredictability - they'll adapt when needed but always come home to rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: With a 75% rock frequency and the consistent pattern of returning to rock after deviations, scissors continues to have excellent expected value. Even when they adapt (like the paper play), they quickly revert to rock, making scissors profitable in the long run.\n\nThe expected value of scissors against this opponent is approximately 0.75 \u00d7 1 + 0.125 \u00d7 0 + 0.125 \u00d7 (-1) = 0.625 points, which is very strong.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The pattern is crystal clear now. This opponent has shown they will occasionally adapt tactically, but rock is their fundamental strategy. They've now played rock immediately after both of their non-rock moves, confirming their bias.\n\nStatistics Expert: Absolutely. With 75% rock frequency and the consistent reversion pattern, scissors remains our statistically optimal choice with high expected value.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent shows consistent 75% rock preference with tactical deviations that immediately revert back to rock, making scissors the clear statistical favorite) scissors"

Critically, both paper plays successfully countered my scissors - this is NOT coincidental.\n\nPsychology Expert: This opponent has evolved significantly. They've now used paper twice, both times strategically to counter my scissors plays. This shows:\n1. They're actively learning from the game flow\n2. They recognize when I'm using scissors repeatedly \n3. They can deliberately break their rock pattern to counter me\n4. They might be developing a meta-strategy: use rock as default, but switch to paper when I use scissors too much\n\nThis is no longer a simple pattern-based opponent - they're adapting to MY patterns.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This changes everything. The opponent has demonstrated they will use paper specifically to counter my scissors strategy. They've now shown paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper pattern after I had success with scissors. \n\nIf they expect me to continue with scissors, they might play paper again. If they think I'll adapt, they might revert to rock. This is becoming a true strategic mind game.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent is clearly learning and specifically countering my scissors success with paper. They might expect me to switch strategies now, so they could revert to their rock comfort zone. Rock would beat their likely rock play with +3 points, or counter another paper play with +3 points.\n\nStatistics Expert: Given their demonstrated ability to counter-adapt, and their likely expectation that I'll change strategy after two paper losses, rock seems optimal for both scenarios.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent has now used paper twice specifically to counter my scissors success, showing strategic adaptation, so switching to rock to counter their likely continued paper use or rock reversion) rock"

The opponent has now played paper three consecutive times (rounds 6, 9, 10), showing a major strategic shift toward paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a dramatic evolution. The opponent discovered paper's effectiveness and has now made it a primary strategy, not just a tactical counter. They went from 0% paper to 30% paper usage. However, my rock just beat their paper for +3 points, which might cause them to reconsider.\n\nThey could:\n1. Continue with paper thinking it's still a good strategy\n2. Revert to their rock comfort zone after the loss\n3. Expect me to play scissors to counter their paper trend\n\nGame Theory Expert: The three consecutive paper plays represent their biggest pattern shift yet. Given that my rock just successfully countered their paper (+3 points), they face a decision point. If they continue with paper, scissors wins me +1. If they revert to rock (their historical preference), scissors also wins me +1. If they try scissors (rarely used), we tie.\n\nScissors covers most scenarios favorably and is the clear counter to their recent paper trend.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent has shifted heavily toward paper strategy, but my rock just disrupted that with a big +3 win. Whether they continue with paper or revert to rock, scissors provides good expected value.\n\nStatistics Expert: Agreed.

After losing big with paper in round 10, they immediately reverted to rock - their historical safe haven.\n\nPsychology Expert: This confirms the opponent's psychological profile perfectly. When their strategic adaptation (the paper trend) was punished with a -3 loss, they immediately retreated to their comfort zone of rock. This is classic risk-averse behavior after a significant loss.\n\nThey're likely to stick with rock for a while now, having been \"burned\" by their paper experiment. The -3 point loss was psychologically significant.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The reversion to rock after the costly paper failure is very telling. This opponent shows a clear pattern: experiment with adaptations, but when those fail (especially with big losses), retreat to rock. \n\nGiven their 64% rock preference and the psychological impact of the -3 loss, rock is highly likely to continue. Scissors remains the optimal counter.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's immediate return to rock after losing 3 points with paper shows they're psychologically shaken by that loss. They're likely to stick with their \"safe\" rock strategy for the next few rounds to rebuild confidence.\n\nStatistics Expert: Exactly.

This is shocking - they played scissors for only the second time in the entire game, and it completely contradicted our expectation of rock retreat.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a major development. Instead of continuing their rock comfort zone after the paper failure, they made a completely unexpected move to scissors. This suggests:\n1. They're becoming more sophisticated and unpredictable\n2. They might have anticipated my scissors counter to their expected rock\n3. They're actively trying to break their own patterns\n4. They could be testing new strategies\n\nThis opponent is evolving faster than we anticipated.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The scissors play was totally unexpected given their historical patterns and recent psychology. This creates uncertainty about their next move. They could:\n- Continue experimenting with scissors (in which case rock wins +1)\n- Revert to rock (in which case scissors wins +1) \n- Try paper again (in which case scissors wins +1)\n\nRock seems like a good hedge - it beats scissors if they continue experimenting, and gives the big +3 payoff if they try paper again.\n\nAI Assistant (you): This opponent just showed they can make completely unpredictable moves.
