I need to analyze the payoff structure: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it beats paper, while paper and scissors only give +1 point rewards when they win.\n\n2. The opponent is described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n3. Fresh players often make more predictable or random choices, and many beginners tend to start with common moves.\n\n4. While rock has a higher penalty risk (-1 if beaten by scissors), the potential +3 point reward against paper makes it an attractive high-value play.\n\n5.

I need to analyze the payoff structure: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it beats paper, while paper and scissors only give +1 point rewards when they win.\n\n2. The opponent is described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n3.

Key insight: Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also a penalty if it loses (-1). Paper and scissors have lower rewards (+1) but different penalty structures.\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what a new player might do:\n   - New players often don't have a sophisticated strategy\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have some psychological bias (rock is often chosen first by beginners)\n\n5.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.
