The hint says I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n2. Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 when they win/lose\n3. This creates an interesting risk/reward dynamic\n\nFor a fresh/new player, they might:\n- Play randomly\n- Have some bias toward rock (since it's often the first thing people think of)\n- Not realize the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff (+3) but also highest risk (-3), and that paper beats rock, playing paper could be a good strategy against someone who might default to rock.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that if they're truly random, each move has equal probability, so I need to think about expected values:\n\nIf opponent plays randomly (1/3 each):\n- My paper: 1/3 * (+1) + 1/3 * (-3) + 1/3 * (0) = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n- My rock: 1/3 * (+3) + 1/3 * (-1) + 1/3 * (0) = 1 - 1/3 = +2/3  \n\n\n- My scissors: 1/3 * (+1) + 1/3 * (-1) + 1/3 * (0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nAgainst a random player, rock seems strategically advantageous. The expected values suggest a slight edge, with rock providing the best potential outcome.\n\nConsidering the \"fresh player\" context, I'll anticipate a rock-heavy initial approach and counter with paper.",
