Scissors (beat my rock, +1)\n4. Scissors (beat my rock, +1) \n5. Paper (lost to my scissors, -1)\n6. Scissors (beat my rock, +1)\n7. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n8. Rock (beat my paper, +3)\n9. Scissors (tied with my scissors, 0)\n10. Scissors (beat my rock, +1)\n11. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n12. Scissors (beat my rock, +1)\n13. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n14. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n15. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n16. Rock (beat my paper, +3)\n17. Rock (lost to my scissors, -1)\n18. Paper (lost to my rock, -3)\n19. Scissors (beat my rock, +1)\n20. Scissors (lost to my paper, -1)\n21. Rock (beat my paper, +3)\n\nSo their pattern:\n- Started with paper (failed badly)\n- Then had a long scissors streak (rounds 3-4, 6-7, 9-15, 19-20) - that's about 12 scissors plays\n- Tried rock a few times (rounds 8, 16-17, 21) with mixed success but including two big +3 wins\n\nMost recently:\n- Round 19: Scissors (beat my rock)\n- Round 20: Scissors (lost to my paper)  \n- Round 21: Rock (beat my paper for +3)\n\nThey just got a big +3 win with rock against my paper. This is the third time they've used rock to beat paper for +3 points (rounds 8, 16, 21).\n \nI'm anticipating their next move carefully. Rock's recent success makes it tempting, but their scissors pattern runs deep. They might oscillate between rock and scissors, avoiding paper entirely. I'll prepare for both possibilities, leaning towards rock or scissors as the most likely choices.",

Analyze my opponent's recent experimentation:\n   - They've been mixing rock and scissors more frequently in recent rounds\n   - Rock has given them excellent results (3 wins, minimal losses)\n   - The tie with scissors might prompt them to switch strategies\n\n2. Consider their decision after the tie:\n   - They might switch back to rock (which has been very successful)\n   - They could continue with scissors (returning to historical preference)\n   - Paper remains extremely unlikely due to consistent losses\n\n3. Evaluate the mathematical reality:\n   - Rock still has the highest expected value (+2/3) in this asymmetric game\n   - Against rock: I tie (0 points)\n   - Against scissors: I win big (+3 points)\n\n4. Consider risk/reward:\n   - Rock offers the maximum reward if they return to scissors\n   - Even if they stick with rock, it's only a tie\n   - The downside risk is minimal compared to other moves\n\n5. Rock maintains the optimal strategy regardless of their specific choice, maximizing my expected value over time.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for optimal expected value and potential big win.\n\n[move] rock",

      "reasoning_text": "Looking at this step-by-step:\n\nMy opponent has shown some interesting patterns over the 22 rounds:\n\n1. Early rounds (1-6): Played paper 2 times (lost badly), scissors 3 times, rock 1 time\n2. Mid-game (7-15): Long scissors streak of 9 consecutive rounds, with mixed success\n3. Recent experimentation (16-21): Tried rock several times with good success, tried paper once (lost badly)\n4. Just played scissors and tied with me\n\nLet me analyze their likely next move:\n\nThey just switched to scissors after having success with rock. This could mean:\n- They might continue with scissors (returning to their comfort zone)\n- They could switch back to rock (which has been very successful for them lately)\n- Paper remains unlikely given their consistent losses with it\n\nLooking at their rock performance: When they play rock, they've had great success - winning 3 times and losing only once or twice. Rock gives them the +3 bonus when it wins.\n\nGiven that they just tied with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors (their historical preference)\n2. Switch to rock (which has been working well recently)\n\nIf they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\nIf they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n\nRock still has the highest expected value mathematically (+2/3), and it would tie against rock or win big against scissors if they return to that pattern.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. They've been experimenting more with rock lately and having success with it. The tie might make them think about switching again.\n\nTheir recent pattern has been more varied: rock (won), rock (lost), paper (lost), rock (won), scissors (tied).\n\nI think rock is still the mathematically optimal play here.",

Analyze their pattern reinforcement:\n   - Scissors has been their go-to move throughout the game (13+ times)\n   - Recent success with scissors reinforces their preference\n   - Rock has worked well for them, but they seem to default to scissors\n\n3. Consider their likely psychology:\n   - They might expect me to switch away from rock after losing\n   - Scissors just delivered success, encouraging repetition\n   - Their historical pattern shows persistence with successful moves\n\n4. Evaluate optimal responses:\n   - Against scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - Against rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses big (-3), Rock ties (0)\n\n5.

This could be:\n1. Random choice\n2. A pattern (maybe they always choose rock)\n3. They might switch now that they won with rock\n4. They might think I'll switch to scissors to counter rock, so they might switch to paper\n\nSince I don't have much information yet, I should think about the expected values. If I assume random play:\n- If I play rock: 1/3 chance of tie (0 points), 1/3 chance of beating scissors (+1 point), 1/3 chance of losing to paper (-3 points). Expected value = (0 + 1 - 3)/3 = -2/3\n- If I play paper: 1/3 chance of tie (0 points), 1/3 chance of beating rock (+3 points), 1/3 chance of losing to scissors (-1 point). Expected value = (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n- If I play scissors: 1/3 chance of tie (0 points), 1/3 chance of beating paper (+1 point), 1/3 chance of losing to rock (-1 point). Expected value = (0 + 1 - 1)/3 = 0\n\nSo paper has the highest expected value against random play.\n\nHowever, the opponent just played rock. Maybe they'll stick with it since it worked? If they play rock again, I should play paper. Or maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors to beat rock, so they'll switch to paper? That's getting into too much meta-thinking.\n \nI'm leaning towards paper. It offers the best strategic balance, minimizing potential point loss while maximizing potential gain.

This confirms my analysis was correct about the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nNow for the second round, I need to think about what they might do:\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. They just lost 3 points by playing paper against my rock. This is a significant loss that they likely noticed.\n\n2. A fresh player who just experienced this might:\n   - Avoid paper since it just cost them 3 points\n   - Try to counter my previous rock move with scissors\n   - Or possibly stick with paper thinking I won't play rock again\n\n3. Let me analyze my options again:\n   - If I play rock again: Good if they play paper (+3), bad if they play scissors (-1), neutral if rock (0)\n   - If I play scissors: Good if they play rock (+1), bad if they play paper (-1), neutral if scissors (0)  \n   - If I play paper: Good if they play scissors (+1), very bad if they play rock (-3), neutral if paper (0)\n\n4. The opponent just lost to rock, so they might be inclined to play scissors to counter it. But they also might avoid paper due to the big loss.\n\n5. If they're thinking strategically, they might realize that rock has the best expected value and switch to rock themselves.\n\n6. Given that they're a \"fresh player\" and just took a big hit, they're likely to either:\n   - Play scissors to try to beat my rock\n   - Play rock themselves after realizing its advantage\n\nI think scissors might be the safer play here. If they play rock (either repeating my winning move or trying to counter my expected rock), I win +1. If they play paper (unlikely after that loss), I lose -1. If they play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Rock still has the best expected value overall. Even if they try to counter with scissors, I only lose 1 point, but if they stick with paper or switch to rock, I either win big or tie.\n \nI'll maintain my rock strategy, betting on the player's limited adaptation skills after the first round's significant loss.",

They've now played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22-23). \n\n\nI notice a clear pattern of strategic behavior. Their scissors strategy dominates, with a long consecutive streak and frequent returns to this move. They consistently avoid paper due to repeated losses and have limited rock plays. \n\nAnalyzing potential moves, paper seems strategically advantageous against their likely scissors continuation. The game's rhythm suggests a predictable yet adaptable opponent who gravitates toward familiar successful patterns.",
