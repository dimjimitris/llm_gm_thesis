    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The opponent played scissors instead of the expected rock. This tells us they're either: 1) Not following typical \"fresh player\" patterns, 2) Thinking strategically, or 3) Playing randomly. We can't determine their strategy from just one move, but we should adjust our approach.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The scissors choice is notable because it's less common as an opening move. It could indicate the opponent is either more experienced than described, deliberately trying to be unpredictable, or truly random. We need more data to establish patterns.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** Given the uncertainty, we should consider expected values again. If the opponent is truly random, all moves have equal expected value of 0. However, if there's any pattern emerging, we want to be positioned to exploit it. Rock still offers the highest reward potential (+3) but with highest risk (-3).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since I can't predict their pattern yet, should I try to establish one myself or continue with a mixed strategy? The high-reward potential of playing paper (if they play rock) versus rock (if they play paper) seems important.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With limited information, I'd recommend playing rock this round. Here's why: 1) It offers maximum reward if successful, 2) If the opponent is adapting to our paper play, they might switch to scissors, making rock optimal, 3) The risk/reward ratio justifies the gamble with incomplete information.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree with trying rock. If they're thinking \"player just played paper, what beats paper?\" they might play scissors, which loses to rock for maximum penalty to them.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to potentially capitalize on maximum reward and test if opponent is counter-adapting.\n\n[move] (Switching to rock to test if opponent adapts to my previous paper play and to capture maximum reward potential) rock"

This could indicate: 1) The opponent is playing randomly, 2) They're following some internal logic, or 3) They're adapting. The fact they played rock after I played paper suggests they might be thinking strategically about countering my moves.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The sequence scissors-rock is interesting. If they're trying to counter-adapt, they might have expected me to play paper again (since it won) and played scissors to beat it. When I switched to rock, we tied. Now they might expect me to continue with rock or switch back to paper.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** We're now at 1 point total. The opponent might be thinking: \"They won with paper, tied with rock, what's next?\" If they expect me to cycle through moves, they might play paper to beat an expected rock. But if they think I'll go back to my winning paper, they might play scissors again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the opponent played scissors first (unusual for fresh players) and then rock (possibly adaptive), they seem more strategic than initially thought. What should be my approach?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think scissors is the optimal play here. If they're being adaptive and expect me to either repeat rock or return to paper, scissors beats paper and ties with scissors if they make the same logical choice. The risk is manageable (-1 if they play rock) compared to potential reward.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Scissors also breaks any predictable pattern I might be establishing. After paper-rock, scissors completes a cycle and keeps them guessing about my strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter potential paper play while maintaining unpredictability.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to counter expected paper while breaking any predictable pattern) scissors"

The opponent's sequence is: scissors, rock, rock. They seem to be favoring rock now - played it twice in a row. My sequence has been paper, rock, scissors. I'm at 2 points total. If they continue with rock, paper gives me the maximum reward (+3).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The double rock play suggests they might be settling into rock as a \"default\" choice, especially after seeing it work once (the tie). Many players, when uncertain, gravitate toward rock as it feels like the \"strongest\" option psychologically. The fact they started with scissors but shifted to rock twice supports this theory.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If there's even a 40% chance they play rock again, paper becomes the optimal choice due to the +3 payoff. The risk of -1 if they play scissors is acceptable given the potential reward. Rock playing twice in a row increases the likelihood they'll stick with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern seems to show they're gravitating toward rock. Should I exploit this with paper, or is this too obvious and they might adapt?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend paper. Here's the logic: 1) They've shown a preference for rock (2 out of 3 plays), 2) Paper maximizes reward if they continue this pattern, 3) Even if they switch, the maximum loss is -1, which is manageable given our current 2-point lead.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed. Players often stick with rock when they're feeling uncertain or want to play \"safe.\" The psychological momentum toward rock after two consecutive plays is strong.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to exploit the apparent rock preference and maximize reward potential.\n\n[move] (Capitalizing on opponent's apparent preference for rock to maximize reward with paper) paper"

Rock beats paper (not the other way around), giving rock +3 and paper -3. Let me correct the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3) \n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This completely changes our strategy! The opponent playing rock three times (scissors, rock, rock, rock) while we wrongly tried to counter with paper shows they may have understood the rules better than we did initially.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** We're now at -1 points total (2 - 3 = -1). The opponent has been favoring rock, which is actually the dominant high-reward move. If they continue with rock, we need scissors to beat it (+1 for us, -1 for them).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if the opponent keeps playing rock (which they've done 3 out of 4 times), scissors is the correct counter, not paper! I completely misunderstood the game mechanics.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! Given their strong preference for rock (75% of plays), scissors is optimal. It beats rock for +1 and only loses to paper for -1. Since they've shown little interest in paper, scissors has positive expected value.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their rock preference makes even more sense now - it's the highest reward move (+3) when successful.

The opponent's pattern is: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock. They've played rock 4 out of 5 times (80%). I'm back to 0 points total. This strong rock preference is remarkable and suggests either a deliberate strategy or strong bias toward the high-reward move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is heavily committed to rock now. This could be because: 1) They recognize rock's +3 reward potential, 2) They're in a psychological \"comfort zone\" with rock, or 3) They're testing if I'll keep countering with scissors. The consistency is striking.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With an 80% rock play rate, scissors continues to have strong positive expected value. Even if they switch to paper (which beats scissors), I only lose 1 point, but if they stick with rock, I gain 1 point. The math strongly favors scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I continue exploiting their rock preference with scissors, or might they finally adapt and switch to paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend staying with scissors. The opponent has shown remarkable consistency with rock despite it losing to scissors twice in a row. This suggests either stubbornness, a long-term strategy, or inability to adapt quickly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often get \"locked in\" to patterns, especially when the move feels psychologically strong like rock.

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock. They've played rock 5 out of 6 times (83.3%) and haven't adapted despite losing to scissors three consecutive times. I'm now at +1 points total. This level of consistency suggests a very deliberate strategy or extreme inflexibility.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating from a behavioral standpoint. Despite clear evidence that rock loses to scissors, they persist with rock. This could indicate: 1) Stubborn adherence to a perceived \"strong\" strategy, 2) Belief that I'll eventually switch away from scissors, 3) Some psychological commitment to rock regardless of outcomes.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** The expected value calculation is overwhelmingly in favor of scissors. With 83.3% rock probability, scissors has an expected value of approximately +0.67 points per round (assuming they play paper the other 16.7% of the time). This is exceptional expected value for this game.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I be concerned they're setting up some kind of trap, or is this simply a highly predictable opponent? The pattern is almost too consistent to believe.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** At this point, deviating from scissors would be mathematically irrational given the data. Even if they switch to paper next round, we'd only lose 1 point, but the probability strongly favors another rock play based on their behavior.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Some players get psychologically \"locked in\" and will continue patterns even when losing.

I'm back to 0 points. This shows they were observing and learning, not just mindlessly playing rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is a classic delayed adaptation pattern. They were either: 1) Testing my commitment to scissors, 2) Building a pattern to break at the optimal moment, or 3) Finally overcoming their rock bias after enough losses. The timing suggests strategic thinking rather than random behavior.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** The adaptation changes everything. Now I can't assume they'll return to rock. They might: 1) Continue with paper if they think I'll stick with scissors, 2) Switch back to rock thinking I'll now avoid scissors, or 3) Start truly randomizing.

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper. They've now played paper twice consecutively after their rock phase. I'm at +3 points - a significant lead. The pattern suggests they might be overcorrecting from rock to paper, potentially establishing a new bias.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This looks like classic overcorrection behavior. After being \"burned\" by rock losing to scissors repeatedly, they may have swung too far toward paper. The double paper play suggests possible new pattern formation. They might continue with paper thinking it's now their \"winning\" strategy.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they continue the paper trend, rock remains optimal (+3 reward). If they return to rock, we tie (0 points). If they switch to scissors, we lose (-1). Given they just played paper twice and the psychological momentum, paper seems most likely for a third time.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I continue with rock to exploit potential paper bias, or might they adapt again and switch to scissors specifically to counter my rock?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend rock again. The reasoning: 1) They seem to be establishing a paper pattern (2 consecutive), 2) Rock maximizes reward if they continue with paper, 3) Even if they switch to scissors, we only lose 1 point vs. our current 3-point lead, 4) The risk/reward ratio favors the aggressive play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often repeat successful adaptations multiple times before switching again. Since paper \"worked\" for them conceptually (broke the losing pattern), they may stick with it longer.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with rock to potentially capitalize on the emerging paper pattern.\n\n[move] (Continuing with rock to exploit the apparent new paper preference and maintain point advantage) rock"

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper. They've completely switched from a rock bias (5 consecutive) to a paper bias (3 consecutive). I'm now at +6 points - a commanding lead! This shows they get \"locked in\" to patterns and don't adapt quickly once committed.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is textbook pattern-lock behavior! Just as they were psychologically committed to rock despite repeated losses, they're now committed to paper despite it failing twice against my rock. They seem to overcorrect dramatically rather than mixing strategies. The three consecutive papers suggest strong momentum toward continuing this pattern.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With a 6-point lead, I can afford some risk, but the math still favors rock. If paper continues (likely based on their pattern behavior), rock gives +3. If they switch to scissors, I lose only 1. If they return to rock, we tie. The expected value heavily favors rock, especially given their pattern-lock tendency.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should I be concerned they might finally break the paper pattern, or does their behavioral history suggest they'll continue? This is an incredible opportunity to extend my lead.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their history, they seem to stick with patterns for extended periods. They played rock 5 times before switching, and they've only played paper 3 times. The psychological momentum suggests at least one more paper play is highly likely.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their pattern suggests they need multiple failures before adapting.

I'm at +9 points - an overwhelming lead! This demonstrates extreme pattern-lock behavior that's almost mechanical in nature.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is one of the most rigid behavioral patterns I've seen. They appear incapable of rapid adaptation and instead commit to extended patterns regardless of outcomes. The 4 consecutive papers mirror their 5 consecutive rocks. This suggests they might continue with paper even longer before switching.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With a 9-point lead, I have tremendous cushion. However, the math still favors rock. If they play paper again (highly probable), I get +3. If they finally switch to scissors, I lose only 1 point. The expected value is strongly positive, and even a loss wouldn't significantly damage my commanding position.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This pattern-lock behavior is so extreme it seems almost algorithmic.

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors. They broke their 4-paper streak with scissors, which successfully beat my rock. I'm at +8 points. This mirrors their earlier pattern: 5 rocks, then 4 papers, now 1 scissors. They seem to switch patterns after extended runs but in decreasing lengths.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This suggests they do eventually adapt, but with predictable timing. Rock lasted 5 rounds, paper lasted 4 rounds. If the pattern continues, scissors might last 3 rounds, then the next move 2 rounds, etc. They might be settling into shorter pattern cycles as they learn to adapt faster.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they're starting a scissors pattern (like they did with rock and paper), then rock would beat scissors for +3 points. Even with an 8-point lead, maximizing gains is still optimal. The risk is -3 if they switch to paper, but given their pattern behavior, scissors continuation seems more likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their pattern history (5 rocks, 4 papers, now 1 scissors), should I expect more scissors plays, or will they switch again quickly?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on the decreasing pattern length trend, they might play scissors 2-3 more times.

If they continue this pattern like they did before, I need to counter scissors with paper, not rock!\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they play scissors again (likely given their pattern behavior), paper beats scissors for +1 point. The risk is minimal since the worst case is losing 1 point if they play rock.

If the decreasing pattern holds, they might be done with scissors after this 3-round run, or they might have one more.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern is remarkably consistent: each \"phase\" is one shorter than the previous. 5 rocks, 4 papers, 3 scissors. If this continues, their next phase might be 2 of something, then 1 of something. But they might not be done with scissors yet - they could be going for a 4th scissors to match the paper count.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** This is a crucial decision point. If they continue scissors (completing a 4-scissors pattern to match their 4-paper pattern), paper gives +1. If they switch to rock (starting a new pattern), I lose -3 with paper.

The pattern is now: 1 initial scissors, 5 rocks, 4 papers, 4 scissors. I'm at +9 points total. They seem to have completed the scissors phase with 4 (matching their paper count).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern structure is becoming clearer: after the opening scissors, they did 5 rocks, then 4 papers, then 4 scissors. This suggests they might now start a new phase. Given their systematic approach, they might either: 1) Continue decreasing to 3 of something, 2) Cycle back to rock, or 3) Try paper again.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** This is a critical decision point. If they start a rock phase (likely given the cycling pattern rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock), playing paper would lose -3 points.

Three consecutive ties is highly unusual and suggests either extreme commitment or they're completely stuck.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is extraordinary behavior - 7 consecutive scissors with 3 straight ties.

However, the mounting ties might finally trigger frustration and force a change.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** Three ties mean no progress for either player.

They've now played paper twice consecutively after breaking their scissors lock. I'm at +8 points total. They seem to be establishing paper as their new pattern after escaping scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms my prediction - they're sticking with paper as their \"rescue\" move. Having successfully broken the scissors deadlock with paper, they're now committing to it. This mirrors their previous pattern behavior where they lock into moves for extended periods. We might see several more papers.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they continue the paper pattern (likely based on their behavior), rock beats paper for +3 points - the maximum reward. The risk is -1 if they switch to scissors, but given they just escaped scissors prison, returning to scissors seems psychologically unlikely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now played paper twice after escaping their scissors trap. Should I expect them to continue this new paper pattern like they did with their previous extended runs?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their history of pattern-locking (5 rocks, 4 papers, 7 scissors, now 2 papers), they'll likely continue with paper.

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper. They've now played paper 3 times consecutively after their scissors escape. I'm at +11 points - a commanding lead! This confirms their pattern-lock behavior is still active.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect prediction! They're fully committed to their paper \"rescue pattern\" now. Just like their previous extended runs (5 rocks, 7 scissors), they're settling into paper as their new comfort zone. The success of paper in breaking their scissors trap has psychologically reinforced this choice.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With an 11-point lead, I have significant cushion, but the math still favors rock if they continue paper (+3 reward). Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose 1 point. The expected value strongly favors continuing with rock given their demonstrated pattern behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're now at 3 consecutive papers, following their typical pattern-lock behavior. Should I expect this to continue like their previous extended runs?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Based on their history - 5 rocks, 7 scissors, now building a paper streak - they're likely to continue. Their pattern lengths have been substantial, so 3 papers might just be the beginning of another extended run.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Paper \"saved\" them from the scissors disaster, so they're psychologically invested in continuing it. The reinforcement from breaking the tie pattern makes them likely to stick with paper longer.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with rock to exploit the paper pattern-lock for maximum reward.\n\n[move] (Continuing rock to exploit apparent paper pattern-lock behavior for maximum 3-point rewards) rock"

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper. They've now played paper 4 consecutive times after their scissors escape. I'm at +14 points - an overwhelming lead! Their pattern-lock behavior is extremely consistent.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Absolutely textbook pattern-lock behavior! They're now at 4 consecutive papers, matching their earlier 4-paper phase. But given they just did 7 scissors in their previous lock, they might continue paper even longer. The psychological reinforcement from paper being their \"escape route\" from scissors makes them heavily invested in continuing it.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** With a 14-point lead, I have massive cushion, but rock still offers optimal expected value. If they continue paper (highly likely), rock gives +3. If they switch to scissors, I lose only 1. The risk/reward calculation overwhelmingly favors rock, especially given their demonstrated inability to break patterns quickly.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're at 4 consecutive papers now, which matches their previous 4-paper phase length. But they also did 7 scissors just before this, suggesting they can go much longer when locked into a pattern. Should I expect more papers?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their longest run was 7 scissors, and paper is their \"rescue move\" that saved them from that disaster. Psychologically, they're likely to stick with paper for an extended period. Rock remains the optimal counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The fact that paper \"rescued\" them creates strong psychological attachment. They're likely to continue this pattern for several more rounds before considering a change.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue exploiting the paper lock with rock for maximum reward.\n\n[move] (Maintaining rock strategy to continue exploiting strong paper pattern-lock for maximum gains) rock"

The opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors. They broke their 4-paper streak with scissors, beating my rock. I'm at +13 points. This mirrors their earlier behavior - they seem to cycle between patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! They've switched from paper back to scissors - their previous \"trap\" move. This could indicate: 1) They're cycling between paper and scissors now, 2) They remember scissors worked against my previous rock plays, or 3) They're trying to break my rock pattern since I've played rock multiple times.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they're starting a new scissors phase (like their previous 7-scissors run), then paper beats scissors for +1. If they switch back to paper or rock, different strategies apply. Given they just played scissors successfully against my rock, they might continue with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They switched from 4 papers to scissors, successfully beating my rock. Are they likely to continue with scissors (starting a new scissors phase) or is this just a one-off switch?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their pattern history, they might be starting a new scissors phase. They previously did 7 scissors in a row, so they're capable of extended scissors runs. Paper beats scissors for +1, which is safe and profitable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The successful scissors play against my rock might reinforce scissors as a good choice. They could be thinking \"scissors beats rock, and they've been playing rock a lot.\" This suggests potential scissors continuation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter potential scissors continuation and secure safe gains.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to counter potential new scissors phase after opponent successfully broke rock with scissors) paper"

They've now played scissors twice consecutively after their 4-paper run. I'm at +14 points. This looks like the beginning of another scissors phase, similar to their previous 7-scissors run.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms they're cycling between extended paper and scissors phases! After 4 papers, they've switched to scissors and are now building momentum with 2 consecutive scissors plays. Given their history of long scissors runs (7 previously), they're likely to continue this pattern for several more rounds.\n\n**Risk Analysis Expert:** If they continue the emerging scissors pattern (highly likely based on their behavior), paper beats scissors for +1. The risk is minimal - losing 3 if they switch to rock, or tying if they switch to paper. But their pattern-lock history suggests scissors continuation is most probable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're now at 2 consecutive scissors after 4 papers. Their previous scissors phase lasted 7 rounds. Should I expect this new scissors phase to be similarly extended?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their pattern behavior is remarkably consistent. They seem to alternate between paper and scissors phases now, with each phase lasting multiple rounds. The 2 scissors plays suggest this is just the beginning of another extended scissors run.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The successful scissors play reinforced their choice, and now the second scissors confirms they're locked into this pattern.
