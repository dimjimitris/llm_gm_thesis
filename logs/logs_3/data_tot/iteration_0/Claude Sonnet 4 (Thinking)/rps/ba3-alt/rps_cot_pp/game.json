The objective is to maximize my points and/or minimize penalties.\n\n3. I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might not have experience or a developed strategy yet.\n\n4. Let me think about the strategy:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - But rock also gives the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 payoffs\n\n5. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies. In rock-paper-scissors games, people often have psychological biases:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some might choose scissors as it's the \"cutting\" option\n   - Paper is sometimes seen as the \"weakest\" choice\n\n6. Given that rock has the highest reward potential (+3), but also the highest risk (-3), I need to think about what a fresh player might choose.\n\n7. If I assume a fresh player might choose rock (common first choice), then I should choose paper to beat them and get +3 points.\n\n8. However, if they choose scissors, my paper would lose and I'd get -1.\n\n9. If they choose paper, we'd tie with 0 points.\n\n10.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

I need to identify what contributes to winning:\n   - Getting positive points while minimizing negative points\n   - The highest reward is +3 for rock beating paper\n   - The penalties are -1 or -3 depending on what beats what\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (meaning new/inexperienced), I should think about what they might do:\n   - New players often don't have a strategy\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it's psychologically associated with strength)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I lose 3 points (bad)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper, I win 3 points (very good)\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I lose 1 point (not as bad)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper, I win 1 point (good)\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors, I lose 1 point (not as bad)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I win 1 point (good)\n\n5. Since the rock vs paper matchup has the highest stakes (+3/-3), I need to be careful about this.\n\n6. Given that it's a fresh player, and rock is a common first choice, I should consider playing paper to potentially win 3 points. However, this is risky if they don't choose rock.\n\n7. Alternatively, playing scissors is safer - if they play rock I only lose 1 point, and if they play paper I win 1 point.\n   \nI'll calculate the expected value for each move, assuming random play. Rock seems most promising, with an expected value of 2/3. Paper has a negative expected value of -2/3, which makes it a risky choice. The scissors calculation is incomplete, but the partial analysis suggests it might be a balanced option.",
