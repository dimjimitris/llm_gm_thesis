He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I just won with Scissors (beating their Rock), they might anticipate I'll expect them to switch and instead stick with Rock, or they might actually switch as expected.\n\nGiven their historical tendency to cycle through moves and the fact they just completed Rock-Rock, Paper would be a logical next choice. Rock beats Paper, so if they play Paper, I should play Rock.\n\nAlternatively, they might play Scissors. Rock beats Paper and loses to Scissors. \n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. They just played Rock-Rock. In their early pattern it was Rock-Rock, Paper-Paper, Scissors-Scissors. So Paper might be next. Rock beats Paper.\n\nBut they've been adaptive, so they might play Rock again or Scissors.\n\nRock beats Paper, loses to Scissors, ties with Rock.\nPaper beats Scissors, loses to Rock, ties with Paper.  \nScissors beats Rock, loses to Paper, ties with Scissors.\n\nIf I think they're most likely to play Paper (following their old pattern), I should play Rock.\n\n\nIf they play Rock again, I'll counter with Scissors. If Scissors seems likely, I'll choose Paper.\n\nGiven their cycling history and recent Rock-Rock pattern, Paper appears most probable. I'll strategically select Rock to capitalize on this prediction.",
