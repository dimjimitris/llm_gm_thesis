No clear pattern here.\n\nLet me look at their overall tendencies. They heavily favor rock (10 times) and paper (9 times), but use scissors much less (4 times).\n \nI'll anticipate their next move based on past patterns. After losing with rock, they seem more inclined to choose paper. I'll counter with scissors to secure an advantage.",

You scored 1 points.\"\n\nBut according to the rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo rock beats paper - that's correct. Let me make sure I have the rules right:\n- Paper beats scissors  \n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nYes, that's the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. So in round 10, I played rock and opponent played scissors. Scissors beats rock, so I lost. That's correct according to the hint.\n\nLet me continue with the analysis using the correct understanding.",
