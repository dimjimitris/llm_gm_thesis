    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Also trying to counter expected rock plays\n3. Following some other pattern or intuition\nThis tells us they're not completely predictable. We need to gather more data.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us valuable information. Since they didn't play rock first, they might be more sophisticated or random than expected. We should avoid assuming simple patterns and consider mixed strategies. However, with limited data, we can still try to exploit common human tendencies.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** After a tie, many players will:\n1. Stick with their previous move (paper again)\n2. Switch to the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move (scissors to beat our paper)\n3. Try the move they didn't use yet (rock)\nGiven that they already showed some strategic thinking by choosing paper first, I lean toward them either sticking with paper or switching to scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Since the opponent showed they're thinking strategically and might anticipate that I'll switch moves, I should consider what they expect me to do. If they think I'll change from paper, they might play scissors to beat my expected rock, or rock to beat my expected paper.

Have a strong preference for paper\n2. Are stuck in a pattern and haven't adapted yet\n3. Are trying to establish paper as their \"signature\" move\nMany players who find a move they're comfortable with will stick with it, especially newer players. However, after losing with paper, they might finally switch.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's consistency with paper is statistically significant now. If they continue this pattern, scissors would be the optimal counter. However, we must consider that losing might cause them to finally change their strategy. The question is: will they switch randomly, or will they try to counter what they expect us to play next?\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** After losing with paper against our rock, they have three logical options:\n1. Keep playing paper (if they're very pattern-locked)\n2. Switch to scissors (to beat the rock they expect us to repeat)\n3. Switch to rock (to copy our winning move)\nGiven they've shown some strategic thinking but also consistency, I suspect they'll either stick with paper one more time or switch to scissors to counter expected rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent has played paper twice now, including after our tie. This suggests a strong paper preference. Even though they lost this round, some players double down on their preferred move. However, they might also try to counter my rock with scissors. I think scissors is the best play here - it beats paper if they stick to their pattern, and it's unexpected if they're trying to predict my next move.\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to exploit their apparent paper preference.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to exploit opponent's apparent preference for paper) scissors"

After losing with paper in round 2, they switched to scissors. This suggests they ARE adapting, but perhaps with a delay. They might be following a \"try twice, then switch\" pattern, or they could be trying to counter-predict our moves now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The data shows: paper, paper, scissors. They're not completely random, nor completely predictable. After two papers and a loss, they switched. Now after a scissors tie, they have several options. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors (since it didn't lose)\n2. Go back to paper (their apparent favorite)\n3. Try rock (the move they haven't used yet)\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's analyze their decision-making process:\n- Started with paper (strategic choice)\n- Stuck with paper after tie (pattern preference)\n- Switched to scissors after losing (adaptive behavior)\n- Now they've tried 2/3 moves, with rock being unused\n\nGiven they showed adaptability by switching after a loss, and they just tied (not lost) with scissors, they might either stick with scissors or try the remaining option: rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent is showing they can adapt when they lose, but they tied this round so the pressure to change is less. They've now used paper (twice) and scissors (once), but never rock. They might try rock next to complete the set, or stick with scissors since it didn't lose.

They're playing each move exactly twice before switching! This is a classic \"doubling\" pattern that some players unconsciously fall into. If this pattern holds, they should switch to rock next (the only move they haven't used yet) and likely play it twice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The data strongly supports a \"play each move twice\" pattern. This is statistically significant enough to base our strategy on, but we should also be prepared for them to break the pattern. If they continue this sequence, rock is almost certain to be their next move, making paper the optimal counter.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let's verify the pattern:\n- Rounds 1-2: paper, paper\n- Rounds 3-4: scissors, scissors  \n- Round 5 prediction: rock (following the pattern)\n- Round 6 prediction: rock (if pattern continues)\n\nThe opponent has been remarkably consistent with this doubling strategy. They've completed paper (x2) and scissors (x2), leaving only rock for the next phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is crystal clear: they play each move exactly twice. They've done paper twice, scissors twice, so rock should be next. This gives us a huge advantage if they stick to this unconscious pattern.

They've now played scissors THREE times in a row, not the doubling pattern I thought I saw. This suggests they might be stuck in a \"scissors loop\" - some players get fixated on a move after it ties, thinking it's \"due\" to win.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're right - the pattern has changed. The sequence is paper (x2), then scissors (x3). This could indicate:\n1. They're stuck repeating scissors after the tie in round 3\n2. They're trying to \"break through\" with the same move\n3. They've shifted to a new preferred strategy\n\nThis is actually common behavior - players sometimes get locked into repeating a move that didn't lose.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Given they've played scissors three times in a row now (rounds 3, 4, 5), we need to decide:\n- Will they continue with scissors (making it 4 in a row)?\n- Will they finally switch after three losses?\n- Are they now in a \"scissors phase\" similar to their earlier \"paper phase\"?\n\nIf they stick with scissors again, rock beats scissors.

This means they've found a successful strategy and are likely to continue with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're absolutely right - I had the rules backwards too. Scissors beats rock, so the opponent has been very successful with their scissors strategy. They've won the last two rounds with scissors. This reinforces their pattern and makes them likely to continue with scissors, since it's been working.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Let me recalculate the opponent's success:\n- Round 1: paper (tied)\n- Round 2: paper (lost to my rock)\n- Round 3: scissors (tied) \n- Round 4: scissors (beat my paper)\n- Round 5: scissors (beat my rock)\n\nThey're on a winning streak with scissors!

However, the loss might finally shock them into switching moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This level of repetition (5 scissors in a row) is beyond normal strategic play - it's behavioral persistence. They're either:\n1. Extremely stubborn and will try scissors again\n2. Finally ready to break the pattern after losing\n3. Operating under some misunderstanding of the game\n\nThe loss might trigger a change, but their commitment to scissors has been so strong that they might persist.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** After such a long scissors streak, if they do switch, they'll likely go to either:\n- Rock (to beat the scissors they expect me to play to counter their scissors)\n- Paper (their original preferred move from rounds 1-2)\n\nIf they continue with scissors (which is possible given their extreme persistence), paper beats scissors.

This success with rock might reinforce this new choice, making them likely to stick with rock for the next round.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent showed they CAN adapt when their pattern stops working. After losing with scissors in round 6, they switched to rock in round 7 and won. This suggests they're reactive to losses.

However, their switch from scissors to rock happened after they lost with scissors, so they might be ready to switch from rock now too.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent shows a pattern: they commit strongly to a move, stick with it through wins and losses, but eventually switch when it stops working. Rock just failed against our scissors. The question is: will they switch immediately, or try rock one more time like they did with scissors? Their history suggests they might try rock once more before switching.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Looking at their transitions:\n- Paper phase: played 2 times, ended after a loss\n- Scissors phase: played 4 times, ended after a loss  \n- Rock phase: played 3 times so far, just had a loss\n\nThey might either continue the rock phase (as they did with scissors after losses) or switch to a new move.

They're now in a clear switching pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in the last 3 rounds. This is very different from their earlier behavior of sticking with moves for many rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has completely changed their strategy. Instead of persistence, they're now switching moves frequently. The tie with scissors means scissors didn't fail, so they might either:\n1. Continue with scissors (since it didn't lose)\n2. Continue their switching pattern to rock or paper\n3. Try to be even more unpredictable\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Their recent pattern shows rapid switching:\n- Paper (won) \u2192 didn't repeat\n- Rock (tied) \u2192 switched  \n- Scissors (tied) \u2192 might switch or stay\n\nSince scissors just tied (didn't lose), and they have a slight tendency to stick with non-losing moves, they might try scissors again. Alternatively, they might continue the switching pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent is in a new switching mode rather than their old persistence patterns. They just tied with scissors, which means it didn't fail for them. They might stick with scissors since it didn't lose, or continue switching. If they stick with scissors, paper beats scissors. I'll play paper to counter scissors.\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter likely continued scissors or potential switching.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to counter scissors which just tied) paper"

They're in a new switching pattern now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. They just won with rock against my paper, which gives them positive reinforcement to continue with rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock just succeeded for the opponent against my paper. Even though they're in a more dynamic switching phase now, they still show some tendency to repeat moves that work. The success of rock might encourage them to stick with it, at least for one more round.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Their recent pattern shows:\n- Paper (won) \u2192 switched to rock\n- Rock (tied) \u2192 switched to scissors  \n- Scissors (tied) \u2192 switched to rock\n- Rock (won) \u2192 might stick or switch\n\nSince rock just won, they have motivation to continue with rock. Their switching pattern has been less predictable lately, but success often triggers repetition in their behavior.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent just won with rock against my paper. Even though they're in a switching mode now, they still tend to repeat successful moves. Rock just succeeded, so they might stick with it. According to the rules, scissors beats rock, so I should play scissors to counter expected rock.\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter likely continued rock.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to beat rock which just succeeded for opponent) scissors"
