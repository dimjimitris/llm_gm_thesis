    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

According to the rules stated: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This is the REVERSE of standard Rock-Paper-Scissors! In this version: Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, Scissors beats Rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This changes everything! The fresh player chose scissors first (not rock as I predicted), and now they've lost. Fresh players often exhibit \"loss aversion\" - they might switch to what they think is a \"stronger\" move after losing. Since they lost with scissors, they might try rock next, thinking it's more powerful.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're likely to switch to rock after losing with scissors, and rock beats paper in this reversed game, I should play scissors to beat their potential rock choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! In this reversed system, if we expect rock from the opponent, scissors is the winning counter-move. However, we should also consider they might try paper (thinking it beat their scissors), or even stick with scissors out of stubbornness.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given they're a fresh player who just lost, the psychological tendency is to escalate to what seems like a \"harder\" option. Rock feels strongest, so that's most likely. But there's also a chance they'll try to copy your winning move (paper) or randomly switch.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis points toward scissors as the optimal choice, expecting them to upgrade to rock after their loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors, anticipating the fresh player will likely switch to rock after losing with scissors.\n\n[move] (Expecting the opponent might switch to rock after losing with scissors) scissors"

Now they've lost twice in a row with scissors, then rock. They're likely feeling frustrated and might try the remaining option (paper) to complete the cycle, or they could start overthinking and try to break their pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has now played scissors, then rock - a logical escalation pattern. If they continue this pattern, paper would be next. In our reversed rule system, if they play paper, we need rock to beat it (since rock beats paper). However, fresh players who lose multiple times often either: 1) Complete the cycle by trying the third option, 2) Return to their first choice thinking they made a mistake, or 3) Try to copy the winner's strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So if they're likely to try paper next (completing their cycle), I should play rock to counter it. But there's also a chance they might copy one of my winning moves or return to scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two losses, fresh players often experience what we call \"completion bias\" - they want to try all three options to see what works. Since they've tried scissors and rock, paper is the natural next choice. They're probably not sophisticated enough yet to think about copying your strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Statistically, rock is our best bet. If they play paper (most likely), we win. If they play rock, we tie. If they play scissors, we lose. But the probability heavily favors them trying paper to complete their exploration of all moves.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock, expecting the fresh player to try paper next to complete trying all three moves.\n\n[move] (Expecting the opponent to try paper next after losing with scissors and rock) rock"

They went scissors -> rock -> rock instead of scissors -> rock -> paper. This suggests a different psychological pattern. After losing twice, they found rock (which at least didn't lose), so they're sticking with it. This shows they're learning from the tie result and might continue with rock, thinking it's \"safe.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern now shows: scissors (lost), rock (lost), rock (tied). The opponent may be exhibiting \"satisficing\" behavior - they found a move that didn't lose (rock) and are sticking with it. However, fresh players also sometimes alternate between their \"safe\" choice and trying something new. They might stick with rock again, or they might finally try paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're sticking with rock because it didn't lose, I should play paper to beat their rock. But there's also a chance they might switch to paper now, having gotten comfortable with the \"safety\" of the tie.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that they repeated rock after it gave them their first non-losing result, there's a strong chance they'll stick with it again. Fresh players often exhibit \"streak\" thinking - if something worked (or at least didn't fail), they repeat it. I'd say there's about a 60% chance they play rock again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we assume 60% chance of rock, some chance of paper, and lower chance of scissors, then paper is still our optimal choice. Paper beats rock (our most likely scenario), ties with paper, and loses to scissors (least likely scenario).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play paper, expecting the opponent is likely to stick with rock since it gave them their first non-losing result.\n\n[move] (Expecting the opponent to stick with rock since it didn't lose last time) paper"

Looking back at all our results, these are actually STANDARD Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, not reversed. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. I mistakenly thought they were reversed after the first round. \n\n**Psychology Expert:** You're right! And looking at the opponent's actual pattern: scissors (lost), rock (lost), rock (tied), rock (won). They've now found success with rock and just beat us with it. This fresh player is showing a clear learning pattern - they found something that works and they're sticking with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So in standard rules, if they're likely to continue with rock (since it just won), I should play paper to beat rock. The opponent seems to be in a \"hot streak\" mentality with rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! The opponent has played rock three times in a row now, with increasing success each time (lost, tied, won). Fresh players often exhibit \"hot hand\" thinking - they believe their winning move will continue to work. There's a high probability they'll stick with rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After their first win with rock, they're likely feeling confident about this choice. Fresh players typically don't overthink after a win - they repeat what worked.

They've settled into a rock streak after it started working for them. We've now lost twice in a row by predicting they'd continue with rock, and they did continue with rock! But that means our prediction was correct - we just chose the wrong counter.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Wait, I think we're making an error in our game theory. The opponent IS playing rock repeatedly as we predicted, but we keep losing because we're playing paper, and rock beats paper according to the rules. If they're sticking with rock, we need to beat rock, which means we should play scissors, not paper!\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right! I've been making the wrong move. If rock beats paper (which is why I keep losing), then to beat rock I need scissors. The rules state \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly!

Now the opponent has played: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock - and just lost for the first time in 3 rounds. This is a critical psychological moment. Fresh players react to losses in different ways: they might abandon rock thinking it's \"broken\" now, or they might stubbornly stick with it believing it was just bad luck.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent had a very successful rock streak (won 2, tied 1 out of 4 rounds with rock), but now they've lost with it. Statistically, they might either: 1) Switch away from rock, trying paper or scissors, 2) Double down on rock believing the streak will continue, or 3) Return to their original move (scissors) from round 1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a pivotal decision point. After breaking their streak, they might be more unpredictable now. If they abandon rock, they could try paper or scissors. If they stick with rock, I should play scissors again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I think there's a higher chance they'll switch away from rock after their loss. Fresh players often interpret a single loss as \"that move doesn't work anymore.\" They might try paper (the move they haven't used yet in their recent pattern) or return to scissors (their original choice).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we estimate roughly equal chances between paper and scissors (with lower chance of rock), then our best move would be rock - it beats scissors and ties with paper, only losing to paper. But this is a tough call since the opponent could go any direction after their streak was broken.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock seems like a reasonable hedge bet that protects against scissors while not being terrible against paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock, hedging against the opponent likely switching away from their broken rock streak to either scissors or paper.\n\n[move] (The opponent's rock streak was just broken, so they might switch to scissors or paper) rock"

Even after I predicted they'd switch away from rock following their loss, they went right back to rock! This shows an extremely strong commitment to rock - they're not deterred by a single loss. This is classic \"sunk cost\" psychology - they've invested so much in rock that they can't abandon it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is remarkable persistence. The opponent has now played rock 6 consecutive times, including immediately after their only loss with rock. This suggests they have extreme confidence in rock or they're stuck in a very rigid pattern. Given this level of commitment, there's an extremely high probability (maybe 95%+) they'll play rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they're this committed to rock, then scissors is clearly the optimal choice again. They've shown they won't abandon rock even after losing with it, so I should capitalize on this predictability.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! This opponent has moved beyond normal \"fresh player\" psychology into what I'd call \"fixation\" territory. They're locked onto rock and showing no signs of changing strategy. Some players get psychologically attached to a move and can't break free from it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With this level of predictability, we should definitely exploit it.

Even after losing with rock twice now (rounds 6 and 8), they immediately return to rock. This is beyond normal player behavior - this is complete psychological fixation. They're showing zero adaptation or learning.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This level of predictability is extraordinary. Seven rocks in a row, with no deviation even after multiple losses. In game theory terms, they've revealed their strategy completely - they're playing a pure strategy of always choosing rock. Against a pure rock strategy, scissors is the dominant strategy with 100% win rate.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is almost too good to be true. The opponent has essentially given up any element of surprise or strategy. They're just playing rock no matter what happens. Scissors is the obvious choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Some players get into what we call \"choice paralysis\" and default to one option to avoid decision-making stress. Others develop superstitious attachment to a choice. Either way, this opponent has shown they will not deviate from rock under any circumstances.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With this data, scissors has the highest expected value by a massive margin. There's no reasonable scenario where we shouldn't play scissors against this pattern.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is crystal clear - they're locked into rock regardless of outcomes.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors once again, as the opponent has demonstrated absolute commitment to rock through 7 consecutive plays.\n\n[move] (The opponent has played rock 7 times straight with no signs of changing despite multiple losses) scissors"

This opponent has now lost with rock 3 times (rounds 6, 8, and 9) and yet continues to play rock without any variation. This is the most extreme case of behavioral fixation I've ever analyzed. They're completely immune to negative feedback.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is game theory gold! The opponent is playing the purest possible strategy - 100% rock. Against a pure rock strategy, scissors gives us a 100% win rate. There's literally no mathematical reason to play anything else. The opponent has essentially turned this into a deterministic game where we can guarantee victory every time.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is almost surreal. Eight rocks in a row, including after multiple losses, with zero adaptation. The opponent has essentially given up the \"game\" aspect of this game and turned it into a simple pattern recognition exercise.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** At this point, I'm confident they won't change. This level of fixation doesn't break easily. Some players get so psychologically invested in a choice that they can't abandon it even when it's clearly not working. They might even be aware it's not working but feel compelled to continue.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With 8 consecutive rocks, the probability they'll play rock again is essentially 100%.

This breaks everything we thought we knew about this player. The pattern is now: scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper. This suggests they might have been deliberately setting up a pattern to trick us, or they finally broke out of their fixation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a massive shift! After establishing such a predictable pattern, they've now shown they CAN change. This could mean: 1) They were deliberately creating a pattern to exploit our predictability, 2) They finally broke their psychological fixation, or 3) They're starting to randomize their play. We can no longer assume rock with high probability.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes everything! They just broke an 8-round streak of rock to play paper. Now I have to consider whether this is a one-time break or if they're going to start varying their play. If they return to rock, I should play scissors. If they continue with paper, I should play rock. If they try scissors next, I should play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After such a long fixation, breaking free often leads to overcorrection. They might swing to the opposite extreme and avoid rock entirely for a while, or they might alternate between rock and paper. It's also possible they'll try to complete the cycle by playing scissors next, having now played rock (extensively) and paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With the pattern now broken, we're back to a more standard game theory situation. However, their recent play suggests they might favor paper or try scissors to complete the set. Given they just played paper successfully, there's a chance they'll stick with it, but also a chance they'll try scissors or return to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is the most difficult prediction yet. They could go anywhere from here. Rock seems like a reasonable choice to beat potential paper repetition, but they could easily switch to scissors or return to rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play rock, betting that they might stick with paper after it worked, or try to avoid returning to rock immediately after breaking their streak.\n\n[move] (The opponent just broke their 8-rock streak with paper - they might continue with paper or try something new) rock"

They won with paper in round 10, but just lost with paper in round 11. This creates an interesting psychological situation - they broke their rock fixation with paper, had initial success, but now paper has failed them too.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me confirm the rules again based on our results. You just beat paper with rock, which means rock beats paper in this game. Combined with our earlier results, the rules are: Paper beats Scissors, Rock beats Paper, Scissors beats Rock. This is indeed the reverse of standard rock-paper-scissors rules.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the opponent's recent pattern: 8 rocks, then 2 papers. They've now lost with paper, so they might: 1) Return to rock (their comfort zone), 2) Try scissors (the third option), or 3) Stick with paper hoping for better luck.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking their rock fixation and then having mixed results with paper (win, then loss), they're likely feeling uncertain. Fresh players in this situation often either return to what felt \"safe\" (rock) or try the remaining option (scissors) to complete their exploration.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they just lost with paper, and rock was their previous obsession, there's a reasonable chance they'll return to rock. But they might also try scissors, having now experimented with rock and paper extensively. If they return to rock, we should play scissors. If they try scissors, we should play paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a key decision point. They could return to their rock comfort zone or try scissors. Scissors covers the rock possibility and only loses to paper (if they stick with paper again).\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors, anticipating they might return to rock after their paper experiment failed, or covering the possibility they try scissors next.\n\n[move] (After their paper experiment failed, they might return to rock or try scissors to complete the set) scissors"

Their scissors fixation is approaching the same duration as their paper fixation (6 rounds). They're showing incredible persistence, having lost 4 out of these 5 scissors rounds yet continuing with the same strategy. This confirms their complete immunity to negative feedback during fixation phases.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fixation pattern is now: rock fixation (8 rounds), paper fixation (6 rounds), scissors fixation (5 rounds and counting). If their scissors fixation matches their paper fixation duration, we might expect 1-2 more rounds of scissors before they potentially switch. Paper beats scissors, so paper remains the mathematically optimal choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is incredibly consistent behavior. They've now given me 5 consecutive wins with paper against their scissors fixation. Their psychological pattern is so predictable that I can essentially guarantee wins as long as they maintain their fixation. Paper continues to be the obvious choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their fixation durations might be stabilizing around 6-8 rounds. With 5 rounds of scissors completed, they could continue for 1-3 more rounds based on their historical pattern. Either way, they show no signs of breaking fixation mid-cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With 5 consecutive scissors and their established fixation behavior, the probability they'll play scissors again is still extremely high. Paper gives us guaranteed wins against their predictable scissors strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Continue the winning streak - paper beats their scissors fixation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play paper again, as the opponent remains deep in their scissors fixation phase.\n\n[move] (The opponent continues their scissors fixation, now at 5 consecutive scissors, maintaining their pattern despite consistent losses) paper"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** MAJOR PATTERN SHIFT! The opponent just broke their scissors fixation after 5 rounds and switched back to rock! The complete pattern is now: scissors (initial), rock fixation (8 rounds), paper fixation (6 rounds), scissors fixation (5 rounds), and now rock again. This suggests they might be cycling through all three moves in fixation phases!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating! Their fixation durations appear to be: rock (8), paper (6), scissors (5) - potentially decreasing slightly each cycle. If they're returning to rock fixation (completing a full cycle), we need to immediately switch our strategy. In our rule system, scissors beats rock, so we should play scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This completely changes the game again! They've shown they cycle through fixations: rock -> paper -> scissors -> back to rock. If they're starting a new rock fixation phase (like their original 8-round rock streak), then scissors is the optimal counter-move.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their psychology might involve cycling through all three moves in extended fixation phases rather than random switching. If they're back to rock fixation, they could maintain it for several rounds just like before. The decreasing durations (8-6-5) suggest each subsequent fixation might be slightly shorter.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they just switched from scissors to rock, and their history of sustained fixations, there's a high probability they'll continue with rock for multiple rounds. Scissors beats rock, so scissors gives us the highest expected value against a potential new rock fixation phase.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence suggests they're cycling back to rock fixation. Scissors is the clear counter-choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors, as the opponent appears to have cycled back to rock fixation after completing their scissors phase.\n\n[move] (The opponent just broke their scissors fixation and returned to rock, potentially starting a new rock fixation cycle) scissors"

This confirms they've cycled back to rock fixation, completing a full cycle: rock -> paper -> scissors -> back to rock. Their cyclical fixation behavior is becoming clear - they rotate through all three moves in extended fixation phases.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fixation pattern shows: rock (8 rounds), paper (6 rounds), scissors (5 rounds), and now rock again (2 rounds and counting). The durations appear to be decreasing each cycle (8-6-5), so this new rock fixation might be shorter than the original 8-round streak, but they're still likely to maintain it for several rounds based on their psychological profile.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're back in rock fixation mode, just like their opening strategy. If they follow their established pattern, they'll stick with rock for multiple rounds. Scissors beats rock in our rule system, so scissors remains the optimal choice to exploit their predictable rock fixation.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Their cyclical behavior suggests they have an internal rotation system: complete one fixation, move to the next move, complete that fixation, etc. With only 2 rounds into their new rock phase, they're likely to continue for several more rounds based on their historical fixation strength.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With 2 consecutive rocks and their demonstrated cyclical fixation behavior, the probability they'll play rock again is very high. Scissors gives us the best expected value against their rock fixation strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Continue exploiting their rock fixation with scissors - the pattern is clear.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** I'll play scissors again, as the opponent has returned to rock fixation mode and will likely continue playing rock.\n\n[move] (The opponent has cycled back to rock fixation, now playing rock twice in a row after completing their scissors phase) scissors"

Even though they've lost all 3 rounds with rock, they continue with the same stubborn persistence we've seen throughout the game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The cyclical fixation pattern is now: rock (8 rounds), paper (6 rounds), scissors (5 rounds), rock (3 rounds and growing).
