Wait, actually I did win that round.\n\nLet me re-read:\nRound 1: I won. I played paper, opponent played scissors. I scored 1. (This is correct - paper doesn't beat scissors, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost... but the hint said I won. Let me re-read the rules)\n\nThe rules say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, that's backwards from what I thought! Paper beats scissors, not the other way around!\n\nSo:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nLet me re-analyze:\n\n\nI'm carefully tracking the rounds, checking each move's outcome. The pattern seems consistent, but something feels off about the scoring. I need to verify each round's result against the game rules.\n\nThe sequence suggests a predictable cycle, but my understanding of winning and losing needs careful reconsideration. Each move's interaction requires precise analysis to understand the true game mechanics.\n\nTo counter the opponent's emerging pattern, I'll strategically select scissors, anticipating the next rock move. This calculated choice aims to break the repetitive sequence and potentially gain an advantage.",
