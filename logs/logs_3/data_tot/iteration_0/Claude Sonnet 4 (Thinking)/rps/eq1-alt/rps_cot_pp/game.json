Fresh players often have predictable patterns. Rock is statistically the most common first choice for beginners because it feels \"strong\" and is mentioned first in the game rules.\n\n3. To maximize my points, I should counter the most likely move my opponent will make.\n\n4. If I choose paper:\n   - Against rock (most likely): I win +1 point\n   - Against scissors (less likely for beginners): I lose -1 point  \n   - Against paper (possible): Tie, 0 points\n\n5.

My opponent is a fresh player who just lost with scissors. Fresh players often react predictably to losses.\n\n3. Common beginner reactions after losing:\n   - Try rock next (thinking it's \"stronger\" or \"safer\")\n   - Stick with scissors (stubborn repetition)\n   - Switch to paper (less common reaction)\n\n4. Rock seems most likely as their next move since beginners often gravitate toward rock after a loss.\n\n5. To counter rock, I should choose scissors (scissors beats rock according to the rules).\n\n6.

My opponent has now tried scissors and rock, losing both times. As a fresh player, they're likely feeling frustrated.\n\n3. Fresh players often follow a pattern of \"trying everything\" when they keep losing. Since they've used scissors and rock, paper is the logical next choice.\n\n4. Another possibility: they might try to counter what they think I'll do. But as a fresh player, this level of meta-thinking is less likely.\n\n5.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since they played scissors first, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors (some players repeat)\n   - Switch to rock (common beginner pattern after losing)\n   - Switch to paper (less likely)\n\n4. If I expect them to play rock next (common after losing with scissors), I should play paper again\n5. If I expect them to repeat scissors, I should play rock\n6. If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors\n\n7. Given that beginners often switch to rock after losing (it's seen as the \"strongest\" move), paper seems like a good choice again.",
