Maybe they've noticed my pattern and are now playing paper specifically because they know I'll play scissors\n\nThe key insight might be that I need to occasionally deviate from my counter-strategy to keep them guessing, or maybe I should try a different approach entirely.\n\nBut statistically, paper is still their overwhelming preference. I should probably stick with scissors as the optimal counter-play.",

The statistical analysis shows they heavily favor paper, but maybe I should consider if there's something I'm missing or if I should try a different approach.\n\nActually, wait - let me think about this more carefully. They ARE playing paper most of the time (78% of rounds), but I keep losing when I play scissors. This means they're not actually playing paper as much as I think they are recently, or there's some other pattern I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about their recent plays... they've been playing paper consistently when I play scissors. But maybe I should try a different move to see if I can break this pattern or if they'll switch.\n\nActually, let me stick with the statistical approach since 78% is still an overwhelming preference for paper.",
