    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This suggests they may not follow typical beginner patterns, or they received advice. Now we need to predict their second move. After a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move (paper again)\n2. Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's move (scissors, since scissors beats paper)\n3. Go to rock as a \"strong\" fallback option\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us valuable information. If they're thinking strategically, they might assume you'll switch away from paper after the tie. If they expect you to play rock or scissors next, they might play paper again or scissors respectively. However, many players have a psychological tendency to change after any non-winning outcome.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Given that they surprised us with paper in round 1, they might be less predictable than typical fresh players. If they're likely to switch away from paper, they'll probably go to either rock or scissors. If I play scissors, I beat paper (if they stick) and tie with scissors (if they switch to scissors), but lose to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I'd lean toward them switching to scissors or rock rather than repeating paper. Many players feel \"stuck\" after a tie and want to try something different. Scissors feels like a natural progression from paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we expect scissors, then rock would be optimal. Rock beats scissors and gives us the +1 points we want.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Playing rock to counter their likely switch to scissors after the tie.\n\n[move] (After a tie, players often switch moves, and scissors is a likely choice from paper) rock"

This fresh player is either very lucky, following a similar strategic approach, or possibly getting advice. After two ties, players typically feel frustrated and want to \"break the pattern.\" The psychological pressure to finally get a different outcome is building.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern so far: paper-rock. If they're following a simple rotation (paper-rock-scissors), their next move would be scissors. However, the fact that we've both made identical moves suggests either coincidence or they're thinking along similar lines to us. This could mean they're more strategic than initially assumed.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Looking at the sequence: paper-rock-?. If they complete the cycle with scissors, I should play rock. But if they're trying to counter-predict my moves, they might expect me to expect scissors and play something else. However, after two ties, many players just want to win and might go with their \"strongest\" feeling.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After consecutive ties, players often resort to their most \"confident\" or \"powerful\" feeling choice. For many people, that's rock - it feels solid and aggressive. Others might think \"third time's the charm\" and try scissors to complete the sequence.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the established pattern of paper-rock, scissors is the most logical next move if they're following sequence. I recommend playing rock to beat scissors. Even if they play paper, we only lose 1 point, but if they play scissors as predicted, we win.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Playing rock to beat the likely scissors move that would complete their paper-rock-scissors sequence.\n\n[move] (Following the pattern paper-rock, scissors would complete the sequence, so rock beats scissors) rock"

This suggests the fresh player is either mirroring our strategy, receiving similar advice, or there's some systematic pattern at play. The repeated rock suggests they may have locked onto it as their \"safe\" choice after the first tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating from a game theory perspective. Either we're facing someone who thinks exactly like us, or they're using a counter-strategy where they predict our moves perfectly. The sequence paper-rock-rock suggests they might be sticking with rock now, having found it \"worked\" twice.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** If they're sticking with rock because it's been \"successful\" (even though ties aren't wins), then I should play paper to finally break the tie streak and win. But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect me to play paper to beat their rock, they might switch to scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After three ties, most players experience significant frustration and urgency to finally win. They might either:\n1. Stick with rock since it's been \"working\" (preventing losses)\n2. Switch dramatically to try something completely different\nThe psychological pressure is intense now - they want resolution.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the rock-rock pattern in rounds 2-3, there's a decent chance they'll play rock again.

Looking back at the rules: rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock. So when they played rock and I played paper, rock beat paper, hence I lost. I had the relationships backwards in my reasoning!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** You're absolutely right! Let me correct the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock wins +1, Paper loses -1)\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper wins +1, Scissors loses -1)  \n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors wins +1, Rock loses -1)\n\nSo they've been playing: paper-rock-rock-rock.

Rock probably feels like their power move now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they played rock three consecutive times and it finally paid off against my paper, the probability they stick with rock is quite high.

They're definitely not a typical \"fresh player\" - they're adapting and counter-predicting our moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze their pattern: paper-rock-rock-rock-paper. They're not following simple sequences or sticking with winning moves. Instead, they seem to be anticipating our counter-moves. When we expected them to stick with rock, they switched to paper. This suggests they're thinking strategically about what we might play.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** I'm now 0-2 in decided rounds (with 3 ties).

After paper-rock-rock-rock-paper, predicting their next move is very difficult.

In a mixed strategy equilibrium, each move should be played 1/3 of the time randomly. Since they're outpredicting us with logic, perhaps we should choose more randomly.

Let me track their sequence in decided rounds: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their recent pattern, they were alternating rock-scissors for several rounds (rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock), but then they switched to paper. This breaks the rock-scissors alternation pattern we thought we identified.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Their sequence shows: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper. The original rock-paper-scissors cycle ran for 6 moves, then shifted to rock-scissors alternation, and now they've played paper. The pattern is becoming less predictable again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing with paper to my rock, they might switch strategies again. Given that they just broke their rock-scissors pattern with paper, they could go back to rock, try scissors, or stick with paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Without a clear pattern emerging from their recent moves, this is becoming more like random play. If I had to guess, after playing paper and losing, they might switch to scissors or rock. If they play scissors, rock beats scissors. If they play rock, paper beats rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Playing rock, which beats scissors if they choose that option.\n\n[move] (Pattern less clear, playing rock to beat potential scissors choice) rock"

Let me carefully track their sequence in decided rounds: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their full sequence: they started with perfect rock-paper-scissors cycles for the first 9 moves, then switched to: scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors. It appears they might have shifted to a scissors-rock-paper cycle instead of the original rock-paper-scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Yes! Their recent pattern shows: scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors. If they're now following a scissors-rock-paper cycle, and they just played scissors, their next move should be rock. To beat rock, I need to play paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The shift from rock-paper-scissors to scissors-rock-paper makes sense as a variation. It maintains the three-move cycle structure but changes the starting point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they continue the scissors-rock-paper pattern and play rock next, our paper will beat their rock and give us another win. This seems consistent with their recent behavior.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Playing paper to beat their expected rock in the scissors-rock-paper cycle.\n\n[move] (Following scissors-rock-paper pattern, next should be rock, paper beats rock) paper"

The pattern has become quite complex and less reliable.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Their recent moves show: rock, paper, scissors, paper. If there's any pattern here, it's not immediately obvious. After playing paper and getting a tie, they might stick with paper, switch to rock, or go to scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie with paper, they might feel the need to switch to break the stalemate. Rock or scissors seem equally likely as their next choice to avoid another tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given the uncertainty in their pattern and the need to avoid another tie, I'd suggest playing scissors. If they play paper again (to stick with what tied), scissors beats paper. If they play rock, we lose, but if they play scissors, we tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Playing scissors to beat paper if they repeat their tie move.\n\n[move] (After paper tie, scissors beats paper if they repeat) scissors"
