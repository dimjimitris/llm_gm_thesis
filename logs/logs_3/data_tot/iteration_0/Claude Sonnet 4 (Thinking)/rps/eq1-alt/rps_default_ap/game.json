In traditional rules:\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n- paper beats rock\n\nBut in this game:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo I played paper, opponent played scissors, and paper beats scissors, so I won and got 1 point. That makes sense now.\n\nFor my next move, I need to think about what the opponent might do. They just played scissors and lost. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something that would have beaten my paper (rock beats paper according to these rules)\n3. Play randomly\n\nSince they lost with scissors, they might try rock to counter my paper strategy. If they play rock, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock in this game). But they might also think I'll expect that and play something else.\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time, as it covers me if they try paper, and gives me a different option than my previous paper move.",

Let me re-read this carefully.\n\nThe rules state:\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1) \n- scissors beats rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1)\n\nSo in this version:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper  \n- Scissors > Rock\n\nThis is the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors! In traditional RPS:\n- Paper > Rock\n- Rock > Scissors\n- Scissors > Paper\n\nBut here it's:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nSo I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won because paper beats scissors in this game. I got 1 point.\n\nNow for round 2, I need to think about what the opponent might do. They just lost with scissors. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to try to counter what I played (paper) - so they might play rock since rock beats paper\n3. Try something completely different\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player\" they might not have a sophisticated strategy. If they try to counter my previous move, they'd play rock. If I expect them to play rock, I should play scissors since scissors beats rock.\n\nBut this is only the second move, so it's hard to establish a pattern yet. I'll go with scissors to counter a potential rock play.",

They seem to get stuck in long patterns - they played rock heavily early on, then switched to paper for 8 consecutive rounds, and now they're in a scissors phase for 6 rounds.\n\nGiven this pattern behavior, they'll likely continue with scissors, so I should continue with paper.",
