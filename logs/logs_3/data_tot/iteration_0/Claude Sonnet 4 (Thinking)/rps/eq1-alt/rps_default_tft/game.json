But wait, that doesn't match the rules I was given. Let me re-read:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors. I played paper, opponent played scissors, so I won. That matches what the hint said. Good.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about what the opponent might do. They played scissors in the first round. Since they're described as a \"fresh player\", they might not have a sophisticated strategy. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to something else randomly\n3. Try to counter what I played (they might expect me to play paper again and play scissors)\n\nSince this is only the second round, there's not much pattern to go on.

In this version:\n- paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo if I played paper and opponent played scissors, I won because paper beats scissors in this game.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent also played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\nSo the opponent's pattern so far: scissors, then rock.\n\nI need to think about what they might play next. They've tried scissors (lost), then rock (tied). They might try paper next to complete the cycle, or they might try to counter what they think I'll play.\n\nIf they play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper).\nIf they play rock again, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock).\nIf they play scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors).\n\nSince they haven't tried paper yet, and many players will cycle through all options, I'll guess they'll try paper next.",

Switch to something else\n\nSince this is described as a \"fresh player\", they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. They might randomly pick or they might react to losing by switching. \n\nIf they switch randomly, I have a 1/3 chance with any move.\nIf they try to counter my previous move (paper), they might play rock (which beats paper).\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play paper again.\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time, as it's a good counter if they try to play paper to beat my previous paper move.",
