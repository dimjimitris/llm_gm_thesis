In the absence of information, I should consider what most players tend to choose in their first move.\n4.

A common psychological pattern is for players to switch to what would have beaten their previous choice - in this case, scissors (to beat my paper).\n5. If I predict they'll play scissors, my optimal counter would be rock.\n6. However, they might also anticipate that I'll continue with paper since it worked before, and choose scissors to counter.\n7.
