Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the absence of information, I should consider what most players might choose in a first move.\n   - Rock is statistically the most common first move choice for many players\n   - People often avoid Scissors as a first move\n   - Paper is a reasonable counter to the common Rock opening\n4. However, if my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this thinking and choose Scissors to counter my Paper.\n5. Since this is just the first round and I have no information, any choice has equal expected value mathematically.\n6.

After a tie, players often change their move in the next round to try to gain advantage.\n4. Since we both played Paper, my opponent might anticipate me switching to Scissors (which beats Paper).\n5.

Since changing move after a tie is a common behavior, I think my opponent is most likely to switch to either Rock or Scissors.\n10.

My opponent's sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n\n3. I've now won three rounds in a row, which is significant.\n\n4. My sequence in those winning rounds was: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper, essentially cycling through all three options.\n\n5. My opponent might recognize this cycle and expect me to play Rock next (continuing the cycle).\n\n6. If they expect me to play Rock, they would likely choose Paper to counter.\n\n7. Additionally, after playing Rock (round 11), they have typically followed with Scissors in previous rounds (after rounds 2, 4, and 8).\n\n8. However, they might be aware of their own pattern and deliberately break it.\n\n9. Given that I've won 7 rounds, lost 1, and tied 3, they're likely getting frustrated and might change their approach entirely.\n\n10. Weighing all factors, I believe they're most likely to either:\n    - Play Paper (to beat my expected Rock)\n    - Play Scissors (following their pattern after Rock)\n\n11. Between these two options, Paper seems more likely as they try to anticipate my next move in the apparent cycle.\n\n12.

My sequence in these winning rounds has been: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n5.

This is significant as it may indicate my opponent has adapted to my strategy.\n\n4. After playing Paper (round 12), they chose Scissors this time - breaking their usual pattern of following Paper with Paper or Rock.\n\n5. This suggests they've become more unpredictable or are now actively trying to counter my moves rather than following their own pattern.\n\n6. Looking at my recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 ?, they might expect me to complete the cycle with Rock.\n\n7. If they expect me to play Rock, they would likely choose Paper.\n\n8. However, after playing Scissors (round 13), they have historically followed with either Paper or Rock.\n\n9. Given that they just broke their pattern successfully, they might continue with this new adaptive approach.\n\n10. Since I just lost with Paper against their Scissors, they might expect me to switch to Rock (the natural counter to their Scissors).\n\n11.

I've now lost two rounds in a row, which suggests my opponent has successfully adapted to counter my strategy.\n\n4. Their last three moves have been: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper, cycling through all three options.\n\n5. After playing Paper (round 19), historically they've often followed with either Paper again or Rock.\n\n6. My recent performance has declined - I need to break this losing streak.\n\n7. Since I just lost with Rock against their Paper, they might expect me to switch to Scissors (which beats Paper).\n\n8. If they expect me to play Scissors, they would likely choose Rock.\n\n9. However, they might also continue their apparent cycling pattern (Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 ?), which would mean Scissors next.\n\n10. Given that they've won two consecutive rounds with different moves, they might be gaining confidence in their adaptability.\n\n11. Considering all factors, they're more likely to play Rock next - both as a counter to my expected Scissors and as a logical follow-up to their Paper.\n\n12. To counter their expected Rock play, my best move would be Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Since I just won with Paper against their Rock, they might expect me to play Paper again (repeating a successful move).\n\n8. If they expect me to play Paper, they would likely choose Scissors.\n\n9. Alternatively, after playing Rock and losing (round 20), they might switch to Paper to try a new approach.\n\n10. However, they've shown a tendency to follow Rock with Scissors in multiple previous instances.\n\n11. Weighing all factors, Scissors seems like their most likely next move - both following their historical pattern after Rock and as a counter to my potential repeated Paper.\n\n12. To counter their expected Scissors play, my best move would be Rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
