    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing against a fresh player, which means I don't have prior information about their play patterns.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal expected value in theory.\n3. Since I don't have information about my opponent's tendencies, I should avoid being predictable myself.\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n5. If my opponent chooses rock first (which is common), then paper would be the optimal counter.\n6. However, if my opponent is strategically sophisticated, they might anticipate this and choose scissors instead.\n7. Given the uncertainty, I need to make a balanced choice that gives me a reasonable chance.\n8. Since paper beats the common first-move choice (rock), I'll select paper for this round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If my opponent is using a pattern, they might stick with a winning move (scissors) since it worked before.\n4. Alternatively, they might expect me to counter their scissors with rock, so they might switch to paper.\n5. I need to consider what my opponent thinks I might do:\n   - They know I played paper last time and lost\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock to counter their scissors\n   - If they anticipate this, they would play paper\n6. Given this reasoning, I should play scissors to counter their potential paper play.\n7. However, if they're simply using a rotation strategy, they might play rock next after their scissors.\n8.
