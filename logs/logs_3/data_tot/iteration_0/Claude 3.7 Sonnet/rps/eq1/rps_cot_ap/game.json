Key insights:\n   - My opponent has finally broken their extreme paper pattern\n   - They waited until I had established a clear pattern of playing scissors to counter their paper\n   - This suggests they were capable of adapting but waited until my strategy became very predictable\n   - They might be more strategic than their previous behavior suggested\n\n5. After this significant change, the opponent might:\n   - Return to their paper strategy now that they've broken my confidence in predicting them\n   - Continue with rock since it just won\n   - Play scissors to try to establish a more varied pattern\n\n6. I need to adapt to this new information:\n   - Playing scissors again would be risky as they might stick with rock\n   - Playing rock would counter their potential scissors but lose to paper\n   - Playing paper would beat their rock if they repeat it, and tie with paper if they return to their old pattern\n\n7.

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. The opponent's moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played paper eleven times (58%), rock five times (26%), and scissors three times (16%)\n   - They've played rock five times in a row\n   - They've lost three times with rock against my paper but continued playing it\n\n3. My overall record is now 12 wins, 4 ties, and 3 losses.\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - My opponent has maintained their rock strategy despite losing three times in a row with it\n   - This reinforces their pattern of sticking with a move for many consecutive rounds\n   - They first played paper for many rounds (with occasional scissors), now they're doing the same with rock\n   - Their strategy appears to be to maintain the same move for extended periods regardless of outcomes\n\n5. Given their extremely consistent pattern:\n   - They are very likely to play rock again despite the losses\n   - They eventually switched from paper to rock after 14 rounds, so they might switch again at some point\n   - But based on their pattern, that switch probably won't happen immediately\n\n6. After losing three times in a row with rock, a typical player would switch moves, but this opponent has shown they don't follow typical patterns.\n   - If they play rock again, paper would win\n   - If they finally switch to scissors, rock would win\n   - If they switch back to paper, scissors would win\n\n7. Given their demonstrated persistence with a single move despite losses, paper remains the best choice.\n\n[move] paper (Expecting my opponent to continue with rock despite three consecutive losses)\n"

My overall record is now 13 wins, 4 ties, and 3 losses.\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - My opponent has maintained their rock strategy despite losing four times in a row\n   - This confirms their pattern of extreme persistence with a single move\n   - They appear to change strategies only after many rounds (they switched from paper to rock after 14 rounds)\n   - Their behavior is remarkably consistent and predictable\n\n5. Given their established pattern:\n   - They are highly likely to continue playing rock despite the repeated losses\n   - Even if they do eventually switch, it likely won't happen immediately based on past behavior\n   - If a switch does occur, it might be to paper (their previously favored move) or scissors\n\n6. The safest move continues to be paper:\n   - If they play rock again (most likely), paper wins\n   - If they finally switch to scissors, I would lose\n   - If they switch back to paper, we would tie\n\n7. The risk of them switching to scissors exists, but their demonstrated pattern suggests they're more likely to stick with rock for at least another round.\n\n[move] paper (Continuing to counter my opponent's remarkably persistent rock strategy)\n"

After this change, the opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors since it just won\n   - Return to rock or paper (their previously used moves)\n   - Their pattern suggests they might stick with scissors for multiple rounds now\n\n6.

Common Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology suggests that after a tie, players often shift to what would have beaten their previous move.\n5.

Given that we both played paper last time, there's a higher chance my opponent will switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again.\n5.

Interestingly, the opponent has now played scissors twice in situations where I played rock, suggesting they might be somewhat predictable or falling into a pattern.\n\n5. After losing with scissors against my rock, my opponent is likely to:\n   - Avoid scissors (as it just lost)\n   - Potentially choose paper (to beat the rock that just beat them)\n   - Less likely to choose rock (as it would be an expected reaction)\n\n6. People who lose often choose the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move, suggesting they might play paper.\n\n7. However, they might also recognize that I could be anticipating this and choose rock instead.\n\n8. Looking at the broader pattern, my opponent seems to favor paper (played 3 times) and might revert to it as a \"comfort move\" after losing.\n\n9. Given all this reasoning, paper seems like their most probable move, so I should counter with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors (Expecting my opponent to play paper to counter my previous rock)\n",

Given that they've never played rock in 10 rounds, even when it would have been advantageous, I think they'll either:\n   - Play paper again (their preferred move that just won)\n   - Return to scissors (their secondary move)\n\n8.

Key insights:\n   - My opponent has dramatically changed their strategy after I exploited their paper preference\n   - They waited until I had established a clear pattern of playing scissors to counter their paper\n   - They likely recognized my adaptation to their consistent paper play and countered it\n   - This suggests they are capable of strategic thinking and adaptation\n   - They may have been setting up this move by establishing a false pattern\n\n6. Possible scenarios for their next move:\n   - They might return to paper (their most frequent move)\n   - They might play rock again, thinking I'll expect them to switch\n   - They might play scissors to counter my potential paper counter to their rock\n\n7. Since they've shown they can adapt, I need to be more cautious:\n   - If they're truly strategic, they might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - In that case, they would play scissors\n   - However, given their overall preference for paper throughout the game, they might revert to it\n\n8.

I need to decide whether:\n   - Their pattern-following tendency will continue (suggesting rock again)\n   - They've reached a breaking point and will adapt (suggesting scissors)\n\n7. Given that they switched from paper to rock after I had established a clear scissors counter-pattern, they might now switch to scissors after my established paper counter.\n\n8. However, they played paper for 11 rounds before switching, and have only played rock for 4 rounds so far, suggesting they might stick with rock longer.\n\n9. On balance, I think they will play rock again based on their historical pattern length, but I need to be prepared for them to adapt soon.\n\n[move] paper (Anticipating my opponent will continue their rock strategy despite losing with it)\n",

Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2.

My overall record is now 15 wins, 4 ties, and 4 losses.\n\n4. Key insights:\n   - My opponent has maintained a clear pattern throughout the game:\n     a) They played paper for many rounds (with occasional scissors)\n     b) They then played rock for 6 consecutive rounds\n     c) They're now playing scissors for multiple rounds\n   - They've consistently shown they stick with a move despite losing with it multiple times\n   - They only change their primary move after many rounds\n\n5. Given their established behavior pattern:\n   - They are likely to continue playing scissors despite losing twice with it\n   - They might eventually switch, but their history suggests this won't happen immediately\n   - If they do switch, they might return to paper or rock\n\n6. To counter their most likely move:\n   - Rock would win against their likely scissors play\n   - Rock would lose against paper if they switch\n   - Rock would tie with rock if they switch\n\n7. Based on their consistent pattern of sticking with a move for multiple rounds even after losses, rock remains the optimal choice.\n\n[move] rock (Anticipating my opponent will continue with scissors despite losing twice with it)\n",

Key insights:\n   - My opponent continues their pattern of sticking with the same move for multiple rounds\n   - They've now shown this pattern with all three moves (paper, rock, and scissors)\n   - They tend to continue with a move for several rounds even after losing with it\n   - They've now lost twice with scissors against rock but kept playing scissors\n\n5. Given their extremely consistent behavior pattern:\n   - They are likely to continue playing scissors for at least another round\n   - They've played each move in streaks (paper for many rounds, then rock for 6 rounds, now scissors)\n   - If they do switch, they might return to paper or rock, but this seems less likely based on their pattern\n\n6. To counter their likely scissors play, rock remains the best choice.\n   - If they play scissors again (most likely based on pattern), rock wins\n   - If they switch to paper, rock loses\n   - If they switch to rock, we tie\n\n7. The probability they'll play scissors again seems high given their demonstrated pattern of move persistence.\n\n[move] rock (Expecting my opponent to continue their scissors streak despite losing twice with it)\n"
