Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n3. In a single shot of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, no move has a strategic advantage over others.\n4. Rock, paper, and scissors each win against one option and lose against another.\n5. Without additional information, the optimal strategy is to randomize my choice.\n6. Many novice players tend to choose rock as their first move, so paper might be a reasonable counter.\n7. However, if my opponent is thinking at a higher level, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n8.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "I need to think about my strategy for this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n1. This is round 1 against a fresh opponent. I don't have any information about their tendencies yet.\n2. In rock-paper-scissors, without prior information, no move has a theoretical advantage.\n3. Since this is our first interaction, I have no pattern to analyze from previous rounds.\n4. Common first moves in rock-paper-scissors often include:\n   - Rock (many players instinctively choose this as a \"strong\" opening)\n   - Random selection\n5. I could try to anticipate my opponent's move, but without data, this would be a guess.\n6. For this first move, I'll choose paper since it would beat rock if the opponent follows the common tendency to open with rock.\n7. Choosing paper gives me a balanced option that can win against rock while building information for future rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I'll solve this step-by-step for the Rock Paper Scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n1. I need to choose between rock, paper, and scissors.\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n3. In a single shot of rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, no move has a strategic advantage over others.\n4. Rock, paper, and scissors each win against one option and lose against another.\n5. Without additional information, the optimal strategy is to randomize my choice.\n6. Many novice players tend to choose rock as their first move, so paper might be a reasonable counter.\n7. However, if my opponent is thinking at a higher level, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n8. Given the equal payoffs and lack of information, I'll go with paper for this first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I'll approach this Rock-Paper-Scissors game strategically.\n\nSteps:\n1. I need to determine my first move. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any historical data to base my decision on.\n\n2. In Rock-Paper-Scissors with standard players, the three moves should theoretically be equally likely to be chosen (1/3 probability each).\n\n3. However, studies show that in the first round, human players tend to choose Rock more frequently than the other options. This is a psychological tendency since Rock is perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a fresh player who might follow this tendency, choosing Paper would be advantageous against a Rock-playing opponent.\n\n5. If my opponent anticipates this reasoning and chooses Scissors instead, I would lose. If they choose Paper, we would tie.\n\n6. Considering all possibilities, Paper offers a reasonable strategic advantage for the first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n",
        "I'll think through how to approach this rock-paper-scissors game strategically.\n\nSteps:\n1. I need to choose between rock, paper, and scissors for my first move against a new player.\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their tendencies or patterns.\n3. In a single round of rock-paper-scissors without prior information, no move has a statistical advantage over others.\n4. In this situation, randomizing my choice is a reasonable strategy to avoid being predictable.\n5. I'll consider that many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as studies suggest it's a common first choice. If that's true, paper would be the optimal counter.\n6.

However, research shows that in the first round, many people tend to choose Rock as their first move.\n4. If I expect my opponent might choose Rock, then Paper would be my best counter.\n5. Alternatively, I could choose randomly among the three options to be unpredictable.\n6. Since this is just the first round and I have no data on my opponent, I'll choose Paper as it has a good chance of beating a first-round Rock.\n7.

There are several possibilities:\n   a) They might stick with rock, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat\n   b) They might choose paper, predicting I'll play rock\n   c) They might choose scissors to counter my previous paper move\n4.

The most common response after losing is to switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move.\n5. Since I played paper, my opponent might switch to scissors to counter it.\n6.

However, they might anticipate this and play paper instead, thinking I'll play rock.\n7. Given that they lost with rock, they're likely to change their strategy.\n8.

        "I'll analyze this twenty-fourth round step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. I've now won twenty-three consecutive rounds with a perfect counter-strategy: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n2. My opponent has maintained their counter-clockwise cycle (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) with perfect consistency through all twenty-three rounds.\n3. After twenty-three rounds of absolute pattern adherence, there is no statistical doubt whatsoever about the deterministic nature of my opponent.\n4. Following their established pattern, after playing scissors, they will play paper next.\n5. To counter paper, the optimal choice is scissors.\n6. With twenty-three rounds of perfect pattern adherence, the mathematical certainty of their next move is effectively 100%.\n7. Game theory principles dictate continuing my perfect counter-strategy against their deterministic behavior.\n8. Any deviation from my counter-strategy would unnecessarily introduce risk with no strategic benefit.\n9. My optimal move is unquestionably scissors, continuing my perfect exploitation of their predictable cycle.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
