Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, I don't see a clear pattern.\n7. However, their overall game has shown an ability to anticipate and counter my moves.\n8. At this point, attempting to predict their next move based on patterns seems ineffective.\n9. After a series of wins, players often:\n   - Continue with their winning strategy\n   - Become more confident and potentially predictable\n   - May revert to preferred moves\n10. Their paper preference might reassert itself after building confidence with these wins.\n11. Given the difficulty in prediction, a new approach is needed.\n12. Since direct counter-strategies haven't been working, perhaps a less predictable approach is required.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given the difficulty in predicting this opponent and their demonstrated ability to counter my moves, I'll play paper for this round, breaking my recent pattern of trying to directly counter their moves.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is the second time they've played scissors twice in a row.\n6. After five consecutive wins, my opponent may:\n   - Continue with their successful anticipatory strategy\n   - Become more confident in their ability to predict my moves\n   - Potentially become more predictable themselves\n7. Their recent success might lead them to stick with scissors again, thinking I'll play paper.\n8. Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll play rock to counter their scissors and switch to paper.\n9. The conventional counter to consecutive scissors plays would be rock.\n10. Given that my attempts to predict their moves have been unsuccessful for several rounds, a different approach is needed.\n11. At this point, the game seems to be more psychological than pattern-based.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given their consecutive scissors plays and my recent losses, I'll play the direct counter to scissors - rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
