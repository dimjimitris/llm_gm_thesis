    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, studies suggest that rock is the most common first move choice among players, followed by scissors, then paper.\n4. If my opponent follows this tendency, playing paper would give me the highest expected value.\n5. Another strategy is to be unpredictable myself, especially in the first round where I have no data.\n6.

My predictions continue to be extremely accurate.\n\n4. After eighteen rounds with sixteen losses and two ties, my opponent might:\n   - Be completely demoralized and frustrated\n   - Possibly be playing almost mechanically at this point\n   - Or might finally try to break their patterns drastically\n\n5. Examining their behavior after losing with scissors in previous rounds:\n   - After round 2 (scissors loss), they played paper\n   - After round 4 (scissors loss), they played paper\n   - After round 8 (scissors loss), they played paper\n   - After round 12 (scissors loss), they played paper\n   - After round 15 (scissors loss), they played paper\n\n6. This shows a perfect pattern: after losing with scissors, they ALWAYS play paper.\n\n7. This paper-after-scissors-loss pattern is completely consistent throughout the game.\n\n8. If they play paper (extremely likely based on their perfect pattern), scissors would win.\n9. If they play rock (breaking their strongest pattern), paper would win.\n10. If they play scissors again (extremely unlikely based on their behavior), rock would win.\n\n11. Given the 100% consistency of them playing paper after scissors losses throughout the entire game, paper is almost certain to be their next move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to paper after losing with scissors, which is consistent with their perfect pattern following scissors losses throughout the game.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This shows a strong pattern: after losing with paper, they predominantly play rock (4 out of 5 times, or 80%).\n\n7. This rock-after-paper-loss pattern has strengthened over time, with the last four paper losses all being followed by rock.\n\n8. If they play rock (highly likely based on their recent pattern), paper would win.\n9. If they play scissors (happened once early in the game), rock would win.\n10.
