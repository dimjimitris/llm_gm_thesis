Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I should consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against rock.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\n5. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain).\n\n6. If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n7. If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n8. The expected value of choosing paper seems best, given the higher reward potential and the common tendency for first-time players to select rock.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

To counter their potential scissors play, my best move would be rock.\n\n5.

I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence of moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. After 9 consecutive rounds of following the \"beat my previous move\" pattern, they finally broke it in round 10. Instead of playing Paper (which would follow the pattern after their Scissors), they played Rock.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They may have finally noticed that I figured out their pattern\n   - They may be shifting to a new strategy\n   - They might be trying to counter my counter-strategy\n\n5. I need to consider what their new approach might be:\n   - They might go back to their original pattern (which would mean Paper next)\n   - They might repeat Rock again, expecting me to play Paper to counter their previous Rock\n   - They might be starting a new pattern entirely\n\n6. Given this uncertainty after a pattern break, I need a strategic approach that doesn't rely on predicting their exact move.\n\n7. Looking at the history, my most successful outcomes have been when playing Paper against Rock (+3 points). Rock is also a common first choice when players reset their strategy.\n\n8. Since they just played Rock and broke their pattern, there's a reasonable chance they might play Rock again to test if I've noticed the pattern break.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round. If they play Rock again, I gain the maximum possible points (+3). If they play Scissors, I only lose 1 point. This is a calculated risk based on the pattern disruption.\n\n[move] paper\n"

After breaking their long-standing pattern in round 10 with Rock, they played Paper in round 11.\n\n4.

If they're starting a new rock-scissors-paper sequence, they would play Scissors next.\n\n6. If they're playing what beats my previous move, after my Paper, they would play Scissors.\n\n7.

Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Their pattern seems to be reactive to game outcomes:\n   - After I won in Round 18 (Paper beats Rock), they played Paper in Round 19\n   - After they won in Round 19 (Paper beats Rock), they played Rock in Round 20\n\n4. Interestingly, after they win, they don't continue with their winning move but instead switch to a different move.\n   After I win, they seem to try to counter what worked for me previously.\n\n5. Since I just won in Round 20 with Paper, following their pattern:\n   - They might expect me to play Paper again (since it worked)\n   - They would then play Scissors to counter my expected Paper\n\n6. To counter their anticipated Scissors, I should play Rock.\n\n7. If I play Rock:\n   - If they play Scissors (countering my expected Paper), I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Paper, I lose 3 points\n\n8. Given their recent behavior of trying to counter my winning moves, Rock is the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock this round, anticipating they will play scissors to counter what they expect me to play (paper again).\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. After further analysis, their pattern appears more complex than I initially thought:\n   - After they lost in Round 20, they played Scissors in Round 21 (trying to counter what they thought I'd play)\n   - After they lost in Round 21, they played Rock in Round 22 (which did counter my Scissors)\n\n4. It seems they might be:\n   - Trying to directly counter my previous move rather than predicting my next move\n   - Alternating between Rock and other moves (Rock appears frequently)\n   - Adapting their strategy more dynamically than I expected\n\n5. Since I just lost with Scissors against their Rock:\n   - If they're countering my previous move, they would play Paper (to beat my Scissors)\n   - If they're continuing their tendency to favor Rock, they might play Rock again\n   - If they're using a more complex pattern, it's harder to predict\n\n6. Given that they just won with Rock, they might stick with it (a common strategy is to repeat winning moves).\n\n7. If I expect them to play Rock again or Paper:\n   - Paper would beat Rock and tie with Paper\n   - Paper provides the best expected outcome\n\n8. If I play Paper:\n   - If they play Rock again, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Scissors, I lose 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round, anticipating they might play rock again (repeating their winning move) or possibly paper (countering my previous scissors).\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they continue this alternating pattern, after Scissors, they would play Rock next.\n\n5. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\n6. However, I should consider that:\n   - They might have noticed I've adjusted my strategy\n   - They might break this alternating pattern\n   - They might be using a more complex strategy than simple alternation\n\n7.
