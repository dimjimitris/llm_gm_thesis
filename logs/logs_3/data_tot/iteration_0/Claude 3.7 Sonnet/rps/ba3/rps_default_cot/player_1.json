Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. This is the first move against a fresh player, so I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Examining the payoff structure more closely:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) if it wins against rock\n   - Paper also has the highest potential penalty (-3) if it loses against scissors\n   - Rock and scissors both have lower stakes (+1/-1)\n\n4. Since this is the first round with no information about the opponent, I could:\n   - Choose randomly (equal probability strategy)\n   - Go for the high-risk, high-reward option (paper)\n   - Go for a moderate option (rock or scissors)\n\n5. I note that many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as shown in psychological studies. If that's true, paper would be advantageous.\n\n6. Given the higher payoff for winning with paper (+3) versus the moderate risk (-1 if scissors is played), I'll choose paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me some information about my opponent's thought process:\n   - They also chose paper in the first round\n   - They might have been thinking similarly to me (e.g., expecting rock from a new opponent)\n   - Or they might generally prefer the high-risk, high-reward option\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they'll do in this round:\n   - Option 1: They might stick with paper, thinking it worked okay (avoided a loss)\n   - Option 2: They might switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n   - Option 3: They might switch to rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper\n\n4. My possible responses:\n   - If I play paper again: Tie if they play paper, lose if they play scissors, win if they play rock\n   - If I play scissors: Win if they play paper, tie if they play scissors, lose if they play rock\n   - If I play rock: Lose if they play paper, win if they play scissors, tie if they play rock\n\n5. Given that we both played paper in round 1, there's a decent chance my opponent will switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play. This is a common pattern in RPS psychology.\n\n6. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors move. This gives me +1 if they choose scissors, 0 if they also switch to rock, but -3 if they stay with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

It's interesting that we've had several ties, suggesting my opponent and I may be thinking similarly or employing similar strategies.\n\n5. After playing Paper and tying, my opponent might:\n   - Expect me to play Scissors to counter their Paper\n   - Play Rock to counter my anticipated Scissors\n   - Or they might stick with Paper thinking I'll switch to Rock\n\n6. Given that they've played Paper after playing Rock twice, they might follow a similar pattern and play Scissors after playing Paper.\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If I play Scissors: I win against Paper (+1), lose against Rock (-1)\n   - If I play Rock: I win against Scissors (+1), lose against Paper (-3)\n   - If I play Paper: I win against Rock (+3), lose against Scissors (-1)\n\n8. Based on the pattern analysis and the opponent's tendency to switch moves after playing the same move twice, I anticipate they may play Scissors. To counter this, I'll play Rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score: -2 - 1 = -3 points total\n\n3. The opponent's pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors twice in a row\n   - Their overall distribution: Paper (6), Rock (7), Scissors (5)\n\n4. Interesting pattern development:\n   - They've played Scissors twice consecutively for the first time in the game\n   - Previously when they repeated moves (Rock-Rock or Paper-Paper), they tended to play the same move a third time or switch to a completely different move\n\n5. After playing Scissors twice, my opponent might:\n   - Play Scissors again (continuing the streak)\n   - Switch to Rock (following their tendency to switch after playing the same move twice)\n   - Switch to Paper (less likely based on their patterns)\n\n6. Looking at my losing pattern:\n   - I tend to lose when I play Paper (lost 4 times with Paper, won 2 times)\n   - I've had better success with Rock (won 2, lost 1, tied 2)\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with Scissors, Rock would be my best move\n   - If they switch to Rock, Paper would be best\n   - If they switch to Paper, Scissors would be best\n\n8. Given their pattern of occasionally continuing streaks to three moves, and the fact that Rock has been my most successful move against them, I'll play Rock to counter their potential third consecutive Scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical observation:\n   - My opponent appears to be effectively anticipating my moves\n   - They seem to be one step ahead in their thinking\n   - I've lost the last two rounds with significant point differentials\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - After playing Scissors twice, they switched to Paper (breaking their previous pattern)\n   - They've now played Paper against my Rock twice (rounds 7 and 19), costing me -3 points each time\n   - Their choice distribution has become more balanced over time\n\n6. My opponent may be:\n   - Identifying my attempts to find patterns in their play\n   - Deliberately breaking patterns when I start to recognize them\n   - Using higher-order thinking to anticipate my next move\n\n7. Breaking this losing cycle:\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - I should avoid making the obvious counter-move to their last play\n   - I need to mix up my strategy\n\n8. Since they just successfully played Paper against my Rock, they might:\n   - Expect me to play Scissors to counter their Paper\n   - Play Rock to counter my anticipated Scissors\n   - Or they might play Paper again, thinking I'll avoid Scissors expecting their Rock\n\n9. Given their effectiveness at countering my moves, I'll play Paper. This is less predictable than playing Scissors (the obvious counter to their Paper) and would tie if they play Paper again or win if they play Rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their pattern after losing:\n   - Previously, they've shown varied responses after losses\n   - However, they often try to counter what worked against them\n   - After losing to Paper in round 3, they played Scissors next\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - They now know I'm willing to break patterns and be less predictable\n   - They might expect me to continue this less predictable approach\n   - They may play more cautiously or try to re-establish their own pattern recognition\n\n8. Given their likely expectation that I'll play Paper again or switch to Rock, and their tendency to counter what worked against them, they're most likely to play Scissors. To counter this, I'll play Rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Looking at their pattern after ties:\n   - After tie in round 1 (Paper-Paper), they played Rock\n   - After tie in round 2 (Rock-Rock), they played Rock again\n   - After tie in round 9 (Rock-Rock), they played Paper\n   - After tie in round 10 (Paper-Paper), they played Paper again\n   - After tie in round 15 (Paper-Paper), they played Rock\n   - No strong consistent pattern after ties, but they've generally continued with the same move or switched to Paper after Rock-Rock ties\n\n5. After playing Rock twice in a row, based on their previous patterns, they might:\n   - Play Rock a third time (they've played the same move three times in a row before)\n   - Switch to Paper (they've done this after Rock-Rock before)\n   - Switch to Scissors (least likely based on their history)\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play Rock again: Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock would win (+1)\n\n7. Given their strong tendency to play Rock overall, their history of occasionally playing the same move three times consecutively, and the higher payoff for Paper beating Rock (+3), I'll play Paper.
