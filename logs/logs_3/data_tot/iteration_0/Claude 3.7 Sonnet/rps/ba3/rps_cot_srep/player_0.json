First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors psychology, many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if it wins against rock.\n\n5. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses rock, I gain 3 points. If they choose scissors, I lose only 1 point. If they choose paper too, it's a tie.\n\n6. The expected value analysis suggests paper is a good strategic first move due to the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

A common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is for players to rotate through options. Since they played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n5. Given that paper beats rock for the highest potential gain (3 points), I could choose paper again. However, this seems risky as they just used scissors.\n\n6.

So far, my opponent has played scissors in round 1 and paper in round 2.\n\n2. I've now lost with both paper and rock, scoring -1 and -3 points respectively.\n\n3. Analyzing the pattern: my opponent seems to be making optimal counter-moves to my choices. This could be coincidence, or they might be strategically anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at their sequence so far (scissors \u2192 paper), there's a possibility they're following a pattern. In classic rock-paper-scissors strategy, a common pattern is to play what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they might play rock next (as rock would beat their previous scissors move).\n\n6. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (gaining 3 points).\n\n7. However, they might also be employing reverse psychology, expecting me to choose paper after they played paper, in which case they would choose scissors again.\n\n8. The payoff matrix is asymmetric: paper winning against rock gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning scenarios only award 1 point.\n\n9. Given my current negative score (-4 points total), I need to prioritize a high potential gain, but I also need to be cautious about further losses.\n\n10.

Notably, my opponent has beaten me every time, suggesting they might be predicting my moves or using a specific strategy.\n\n4. Their sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) follows the pattern of standard rock-paper-scissors rotation. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n5. Another observation: their moves have followed what would beat my previous move.

This could indicate:\n   - They've found a pattern in my play they believe they can exploit\n   - They're employing a deliberate strategy of repetition to create unpredictability\n   - They might continue with scissors again, betting on my reluctance to expect four identical moves in a row\n\n6. After losing with paper against scissors, the most straightforward counter would be to play rock.\n\n7. If they play scissors for a fourth time in a row, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n8. However, they might anticipate this adjustment and switch to paper (to beat my expected rock).\n\n9. Another possibility is they'll switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors (thinking they'll play paper).\n\n10. Given their unusual repeated scissors strategy, I need to determine if they're likely to continue or break the pattern:\n    - Most players wouldn't repeat the same move four times\n    - They might expect me to counter with rock and thus switch to paper\n    - The safer play with moderate upside is rock\n\n11. Considering my current negative score and their recent behavior, rock offers the best combination of potential gain and protection against further losses.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

The most striking pattern is that my opponent has now played scissors four consecutive times, which is extremely unusual in standard rock-paper-scissors strategy.\n\n5. This persistent repetition suggests:\n   - They might be employing a deliberate strategy of extended repetition\n   - They could be testing how I respond to repetition\n   - They might continue with scissors yet again, betting I'll think \"surely they won't play scissors five times in a row\"\n\n6. Their strategy has become somewhat predictable, but precisely because it's so unusual, it creates doubt.\n\n7. If they continue with scissors for a fifth time, rock would win again (+1 point).\n\n8. However, they might finally break the pattern after losing and switch to paper (to beat my expected rock) or rock (to tie if I play rock again).\n\n9. The question becomes: how committed are they to this scissors strategy, and how likely are they to adapt after losing?\n\n10. Most rational players would change strategies after losing with the same move four times in a row.\n\n11.

We just tied with scissors. My total remains at -2 points.\n\n4. My opponent has now played scissors FIVE times in a row, which is extraordinary in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n5. This extreme repetition suggests:\n   - They might be employing a deliberate strategy of extended repetition until it fails\n   - They could be using a psychological strategy, attempting to make me doubt myself\n   - They might be playing completely randomly and coincidentally repeating scissors\n\n6. After I switched to scissors (expecting them to switch to paper), they still played scissors, leading to a tie.\n\n7. The question remains: will they continue this unusual scissors streak, or will they finally change?\n\n8. If they continue with scissors for a sixth time, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n9. However, after five consecutive scissors moves, they might finally switch:\n   - To paper (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors streak)\n   - To rock (trying to beat my potential scissors play)\n\n10. The probability of them continuing scissors for a sixth time seems lower than them finally switching, but their extreme commitment to this strategy so far makes it difficult to predict.\n\n11.

After four consecutive scissors moves and our recent tie, they might be:\n   - Continuing their commitment to scissors until it definitively fails\n   - Setting me up to expect scissors again before finally switching\n   - Playing completely randomly and coincidentally repeating scissors\n\n9. If they continue with scissors for a fifth time (in this new streak), rock would win (+1 point).\n\n10. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n11. If they switch to rock, paper would win (+3 points).\n\n12. Considering their strong historical pattern of scissors repetition, and weighing the probabilities, rock seems like the most strategic choice with good winning potential.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

I lost the last round by playing rock against their paper, losing 3 points. My total is now -4 points.\n\n4. This is a significant development in their pattern:\n   - After four consecutive scissors moves, they switched to paper\n   - They correctly anticipated I would play rock again\n   - This demonstrates more strategic thinking than their repetitive pattern suggested\n\n5. After successfully countering my rock with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock again\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock in a more complex psychological move\n\n6. They've demonstrated two behavioral patterns so far:\n   - Extended repetition of the same move (particularly scissors)\n   - Occasional strategic switches to counter my anticipated moves\n\n7. Given that they just successfully switched strategies and won 3 points, they might be emboldened to continue adapting rather than returning to repetition.\n\n8.

Their pattern has taken another interesting turn:\n   - After breaking their scissors streak with paper (which beat my rock)\n   - They've now returned to scissors\n\n5. This suggests:\n   - They might be returning to their scissors repetition strategy\n   - They could be alternating between scissors and paper\n   - They might be trying to establish a new, less predictable pattern\n\n6. If they're returning to their scissors repetition, they might play scissors again.\n\n7. If they're alternating between scissors and paper, they would play paper next.\n\n8. If they're trying to be less predictable, they might play rock to complete a rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n9. Given their history of extended scissors repetition and their recent return to scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n10. If they play scissors again, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n12. If they switch to rock, paper would win (+3 points).\n\n13.

Their last two paper plays suggest:\n   - They're anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n   - They're adapting strategically rather than repeating moves blindly\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock given my previous success with it\n\n6.
