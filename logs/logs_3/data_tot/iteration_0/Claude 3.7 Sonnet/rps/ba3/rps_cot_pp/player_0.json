Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I'll identify the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for rock, -1 for scissors\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for paper, -3 for rock\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for scissors, -1 for paper\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. The payoff structure is asymmetric - winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points).\n\n3. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider what a typical first move might be:\n   - Rock is often a common first move for many players\n   - If they play rock, paper would give me 3 points\n   - If they play scissors, paper would cost me 1 point\n   - If they play paper, paper would result in 0 points\n\n4. The expected value calculation:\n   - If I assume equal probability (1/3) for their move selection:\n     - Paper: (3 - 1 + 0)/3 = +0.67 points expected value\n     - Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -0.67 points expected value  \n     - Scissors: (-1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0 points expected value\n   \n5. Given that winning with paper has the highest reward (3 points), and many players instinctively choose rock first, paper seems like the optimal strategic first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round:\n   - I played paper\n   - My opponent played scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (-1 points)\n\n2. Now I need to consider my opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They played scissors in the first round\n   - They might:\n     a) Stay with scissors since it worked (some players repeat winning moves)\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to rock to beat their scissors, so they might switch to paper\n     c) Choose randomly\n\n3. Let me analyze the expected outcome of each of my possible moves:\n   - If I play rock:\n     - Beats scissors (+1 point if they repeat)\n     - Loses to paper (-3 points if they anticipate my rock)\n     - Ties with rock (0 points)\n   \n   - If I play paper:\n     - Loses to scissors again (-1 point if they repeat)\n     - Beats rock (+3 points)\n     - Ties with paper (0 points)\n   \n   - If I play scissors:\n     - Ties with scissors (0 points if they repeat)\n     - Loses to rock (-1 point)\n     - Beats paper (+1 point if they anticipate my rock and switch to paper)\n\n4. Given that my opponent just won with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again. Playing rock would be my best counter to this.\n\n5.

Review of all previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0 points).\n   - Round 3 onward: I've correctly predicted and countered every move.\n\n2. Through eighteen consecutive rounds, my opponent has maintained the exact same pattern:\n   - Round 1: Scissors\n   - Round 2: Rock\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Scissors\n   - Round 5: Rock\n   - Round 6: Paper\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Scissors\n   - Round 11: Rock\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n   - Round 14: Rock\n   - Round 15: Paper\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - They consistently cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper...\n\n3. Based on this perfect pattern that has held without exception for eighteen rounds, their next move will be scissors.\n\n4. To counter scissors, my optimal move is rock:\n   - If they play scissors as predicted: I win +1 point\n   - If they break pattern with rock: It's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they break pattern with paper: I lose 3 points\n\n5. I've now won sixteen consecutive rounds by correctly predicting their moves. The opponent is clearly following a fixed, programmed sequence that doesn't adapt whatsoever.\n\n6. With eighteen rounds of consistent evidence, there is essentially no doubt they will continue their predictable pattern.\n\n7. I should maintain my counter-strategy to maximize my points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter their predicted scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
