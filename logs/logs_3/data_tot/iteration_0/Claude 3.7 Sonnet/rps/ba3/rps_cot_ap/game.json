I'm playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with a point system:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins against Rock.\n\n4. However, Paper also risks losing to Scissors (-1 points).\n\n5. Rock is safer in that it can only lose 3 points (to Paper) but can win 1 point (against Scissors).\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what a typical first move might be.\n\n7. Many players choose Rock as a first move, as it's a common intuitive choice.\n\n8. Given that Paper beats Rock for the highest point gain (+3), and this is the first round with no prior information, Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for the potential higher payoff against a likely Rock throw.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Psychology suggests opponents often change their move after losing, especially with a significant point loss (-3).\n\n5. Given that my opponent likely expects me to repeat Paper (since it worked), and they likely want to counter that, they will probably choose Scissors this time.\n\n6.

This suggests my opponent is becoming more strategic and adaptive rather than following a simple pattern.\n\n7. My opponent's recent moves now look like:\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   So they've played Paper twice in a row.\n\n8.

Possible scenarios:\n   - They continue with Scissors (which seems increasingly likely given past behavior)\n   - They finally switch to Rock (to counter my expected Rock)\n   - They switch to Paper (to counter my expected Rock)\n\n6.

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 5: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. I lost -1 point.\n   - Round 7: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 8: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 9: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 5-9: They played Scissors five consecutive times\n   - Round 10: They finally switched to Paper\n\n3. This pattern change is significant:\n   - After 5 consecutive Scissors plays, they've broken their pattern\n   - They correctly anticipated my switch to Paper (resulting in a tie)\n   - This suggests they may be more strategic than previously thought\n\n4. My opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They saw I played Rock twice recently and won\n   - They correctly predicted I would switch to Paper to counter their expected Rock\n   - This shows adaptive thinking and potential multi-level reasoning\n\n5. For their next move, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with Paper, expecting me to play Paper again or Rock\n   - Switch to Scissors, anticipating I'll play Paper again\n   - Switch to Rock, trying to reset the pattern or counter my potential Scissors\n\n6. Given they just switched from a long Scissors streak to Paper and tied:\n   - They might feel validated in changing their strategy\n   - They might continue adapting rather than locking into a new move\n   - They likely believe I'm tracking their patterns\n\n7. Since we both just played Paper, common psychology suggests:\n   - I might play Scissors to beat their Paper\n   - They might anticipate this and play Rock\n   - Or they might stick with Paper expecting me to overthink\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Paper again and I play Scissors: I win +1\n   - If they switch to Scissors and I play Rock: I win +1\n   - If they switch to Rock and I play Paper: I win +3\n\n9. Given their demonstrated adaptability in the last round after a long pattern:\n   - They're more likely to change moves again than start another streak\n   - Scissors would be a logical counter to our mutual Paper play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll switch to Scissors to counter my expected Paper or Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors.

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 11: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 5-9: Five consecutive Scissors plays\n   - Round 10: Switched to Paper (tied)\n   - Round 11: Returned to Scissors (lost)\n\n3. This is fascinating behavior:\n   - They briefly broke their Scissors streak with Paper\n   - But immediately returned to Scissors despite losing with it repeatedly\n   - This suggests either a predetermined pattern or very limited adaptability\n\n4. My recent moves and results:\n   - Round 9: Rock vs. Scissors - I won\n   - Round 10: Paper vs. Paper - Tie\n   - Round 11: Rock vs. Scissors - I won\n\n5. Overall pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played Scissors in 7 out of 11 rounds\n   - Against my Rock, they've consistently played Scissors and lost\n   - They've only deviated from Scissors once (with Paper)\n\n6. Psychology and game theory considerations:\n   - After returning to Scissors and losing again, they should be highly motivated to change\n   - They might expect me to play Rock again after my recent success\n   - Logical counters to Rock would be Paper\n\n7. The opponent seems to have two modes:\n   - A default \"play Scissors\" mode they return to\n   - Occasional attempts at adaptation that don't persist\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Scissors again (returning to default): Rock wins\n   - If they play Paper (logical adaptation): Scissors wins\n   - If they play Rock (complete strategy change): Paper wins\n\n9. Weighing probabilities:\n   - Given their history, there's still a chance they'll play Scissors again\n   - However, after multiple losses with Scissors to Rock, Paper is their most logical move\n   - Rock seems least likely as it would be an overcorrection\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll finally adapt consistently and play Paper to counter my expected Rock. This breaks my own pattern of playing Rock and accounts for their likely strategic adjustment.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern has shifted in an interesting way:\n   - Rounds 10-12: They alternated Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Before that, they had played mostly Scissors with one Paper\n\n3. I observe that my opponent is now using Paper more frequently:\n   - Paper in rounds 3, 4, 10, and now 12\n   - This might indicate a shift in their strategy\n\n4. My recent results:\n   - I've won the last two rounds\n   - I won with Rock against Scissors in round 11\n   - I won with Scissors against Paper in round 12\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's pattern from rounds 10-12:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This could suggest they're developing an alternating pattern\n\n6. If they're following an alternating Paper \u2192 Scissors pattern:\n   - Their next move would logically be Scissors\n\n7. Considering psychological factors:\n   - They just lost with Paper against my Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again after it worked\n   - To counter expected Scissors, they might play Rock\n\n8. However, they might also recognize:\n   - I've been successfully predicting their moves\n   - I've won most rounds\n   - They need to be less predictable\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Scissors (following their alternating pattern): Rock wins\n   - If they play Rock (countering my expected Scissors): Paper wins\n   - If they stay with Paper (being unpredictable): Scissors wins\n\n10. Probability assessment:\n    - Given their recent alternating pattern, Scissors seems most likely\n    - Given they just lost with Paper to Scissors, Rock is a reasonable counter\n    - They seem to be adapting more now than earlier in the game\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll follow their alternating pattern and play Scissors, or switch to Scissors to counter my potential repeat of Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 13: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I lost -3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's most recent pattern (rounds 10-13):\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper in the last two rounds consecutively\n\n3. This is a significant change:\n   - They appear to have abandoned their earlier preference for Scissors\n   - They've played Paper three times in the last four rounds\n   - They've won with Paper against my Rock (-3 points for me)\n\n4. My opponent may have identified a pattern in my play:\n   - They correctly anticipated my Rock with their Paper\n   - This resulted in their biggest win of the game\n\n5. Looking at my recent moves:\n   - Round 11: Rock (won)\n   - Round 12: Scissors (won)\n   - Round 13: Rock (lost badly)\n   - I've become somewhat predictable by returning to Rock\n\n6. Opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They've found success with Paper against my Rock\n   - They might expect me to switch to Scissors after losing to Paper\n   - If they anticipate Scissors, they may play Rock\n\n7. Alternative analysis:\n   - They might stick with Paper after it worked well\n   - They might think I wouldn't expect them to play Paper three times in a row\n   - Their recent plays suggest increased strategic thinking\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Paper again: Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play Rock (anticipating my Scissors): Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they play Scissors (expecting me to play Paper): Rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Scissors is relatively safe (wins against Paper, loses only -1 to Rock)\n   - Playing Paper is higher risk/reward (wins +3 against Rock, loses -1 to Scissors)\n   - After losing -3 points, I need to be more cautious\n\n10. Given they've played Paper twice in a row and won significantly with it last round:\n    - They might stick with Paper expecting me to overthink\n    - Or they might switch to Rock expecting me to play Scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll either stick with Paper for a third time after their success or expect me to play Paper to counter their Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Rock (countering my expected Scissors): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (complete change): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stubbornly stick with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Probability assessment:\n   - Given two consecutive losses with Paper, switching to Rock is their most logical move\n   - Continuing with Paper seems unlikely after repeated losses\n   - Scissors is possible but less logical as a first adaptation\n\n10.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 12-15: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \n   - They've now played Paper FOUR consecutive times\n\n3. This is remarkable persistence:\n   - Despite losing with Paper twice to my Scissors\n   - They've continued with Paper regardless of outcomes\n   - Similar to their earlier persistence with Scissors\n\n4. Recent outcomes (rounds 12-15):\n   - They lost with Paper vs Scissors\n   - They won with Paper vs Rock\n   - They lost with Paper vs Scissors\n   - They tied with Paper vs Paper\n\n5. My opponent demonstrates:\n   - Strong commitment to single moves for extended periods\n   - Limited adaptation despite varied outcomes\n   - When they do change, it's a complete shift rather than frequent adjustments\n\n6. After our tie with mutual Paper plays:\n   - They might anticipate I'll play Scissors to counter their expected Paper\n   - If they expect my Scissors, they would logically play Rock\n   - However, given their pattern of persistence, they might also continue with Paper\n\n7. Strategic calculation:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n8. Probability assessment:\n   - Based on their demonstrated behavior pattern:\n     - Highest probability: they continue with Paper (consistent with their pattern)\n     - Medium probability: they switch to Rock (logical counter to expected Scissors)\n     - Lowest probability: they switch to Scissors (complete strategy change)\n\n9. Risk analysis:\n   - Playing Scissors is the most aligned with their demonstrated pattern\n   - It has the lowest risk given their tendency for move persistence\n   - Playing Rock would be a higher-risk counter to a potential strategy change\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll continue their pattern of move persistence and play Paper again, or at least considering it's the most probable outcome based on their demonstrated behavior.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern:\n   - Rounds 12-16: They've now played Paper FIVE consecutive times\n   - This mirrors their earlier behavior with Scissors (5 consecutive Scissors plays)\n\n3. This is extraordinary persistence:\n   - They've lost with Paper THREE times to my Scissors\n   - They've tied once with Paper\n   - They've won once with Paper against Rock\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 14-16: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've played Scissors against their Paper three times and won each time\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent shows an unusual commitment to moves regardless of outcomes\n   - They seem to switch strategies completely after 5-6 rounds with one move\n   - Their first pattern: 5-6 rounds of mostly Scissors\n   - Their current pattern: 5 rounds of exclusively Paper\n\n6. Looking at their full history:\n   - Rounds 1-11: 7 Scissors, 3 Paper, 1 Rock\n   - Rounds 12-16: 5 Paper, 0 Scissors, 0 Rock\n\n7. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Paper three times to Scissors, they have strong reason to change\n   - They've completed a 5-move sequence with Paper (matching their Scissors sequence)\n   - This could be a psychological trigger point for them to switch strategies\n\n8. Potential opponent thinking:\n   - They might finally abandon Paper after repeated losses\n   - If they switch, Rock would be the logical counter to my successful Scissors\n   - They might anticipate I'll continue with Scissors after multiple wins\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Rock (most logical adaptation): Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they continue with Paper (consistent with persistence pattern): Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (complete pattern change): Rock would win (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Paper is higher risk/reward, winning big if they switch to Rock\n    - Playing Scissors is safer if they stubbornly continue with Paper\n    - Given their pattern of eventual adaptation after 5-move sequences, change is likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll finally switch to Rock after completing their 5-move Paper sequence and experiencing multiple losses to Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 12-16: Five consecutive Paper plays\n   - Round 17: Switched to Rock\n   - This confirms my theory that they tend to use a move 5-6 times before changing\n\n3. My prediction was correct:\n   - I anticipated they would switch to Rock after completing their 5-move Paper sequence\n   - I played Paper and won significantly (+3 points)\n\n4. Analysis of opponent's behavior patterns:\n   - They show commitment to single moves for extended sequences\n   - They eventually adapt but in predictable ways\n   - After playing Rock in round 17, they might:\n     a) Start a sequence of Rock plays\n     b) Continue adapting and switch to countering my expected move\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 14-17: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - I've been alternating between Paper and Scissors\n\n6. If the opponent is observant, they might:\n   - Notice my alternating pattern\n   - Expect me to play Scissors next (continuing the alternation)\n   - Play Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. However, if they're following their own pattern:\n   - They might continue with Rock for several rounds\n   - Regardless of the outcome of each round\n\n8. Psychological factors:\n   - They just lost significantly with Rock against my Paper (-3 points)\n   - This might motivate them to change strategies\n   - But their history shows they often persist with moves despite losses\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (countering my expected Paper): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (complete strategy change): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. Strategic calculation:\n    - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Rock is fairly likely\n    - Given they just lost badly, Scissors is also a reasonable possibility\n    - Given my alternating pattern, they might expect Scissors and play Rock\n\n11. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Paper has the highest reward (+3) if they play Rock again\n    - Rock is safest against potential Scissors\n    - Either Paper or Rock seems justified based on different reasoning\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll either continue with Rock (following their pattern of persistence) or play Rock to counter my expected Scissors (if they noticed my alternating pattern).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After 5 consecutive Paper plays, they switched to Rock (round 17)\n   - Then immediately switched to Scissors (round 18)\n   - This suggests they've abandoned their pattern of extended move sequences\n\n3. I notice they're becoming more adaptive:\n   - They're no longer sticking to one move for multiple rounds\n   - They seem to be actively countering my moves now\n   - They played Scissors to beat my Paper after losing with Rock\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 16-18: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - I repeated Paper and lost\n\n5. Opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They might be noticing my patterns and adapting\n   - They correctly predicted I would play Paper again\n   - They countered successfully with Scissors\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with Scissors, they might:\n     a) Continue with Scissors, expecting me to play Paper again\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to Rock to counter their Scissors\n     c) Switch to Rock to counter my expected Rock\n\n7. Their overall game evolution:\n   - Early game: Very predictable, long sequences of the same move\n   - Mid game: Complete switch to a different long sequence\n   - Recent rounds: More adaptive, responsive play\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (anticipating my Rock): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Given their recent adaptation, continued adaptation is likely\n   - Given their success with Scissors, they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to play Rock to counter their Scissors\n\n10. Double-level thinking:\n    - They'll expect me to switch to Rock after losing to Scissors\n    - If they think I'll play Rock, they might play Paper\n    - However, this assumes a high level of strategic thinking\n\n11. Considering their overall pattern recognition:\n    - They've become more responsive to my moves\n    - They've started to break their own patterns\n    - But they might not yet be thinking multiple moves ahead\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll either continue with Scissors after their success or fail to anticipate that I'll switch from Paper to Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's most recent pattern:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors (repeated Scissors)\n\n3. They've played Scissors in the last two rounds:\n   - First time, they won against my Paper\n   - Second time, they lost against my Rock\n\n4. My recent moves and outcomes:\n   - Round 17: Paper (won +3)\n   - Round 18: Paper (lost -1)\n   - Round 19: Rock (won +1)\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent had previously shown a pattern of sticking with moves for 5+ rounds\n   - Recently they've become more adaptive\n   - But they just repeated Scissors despite losing with it\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing with Scissors to Rock, they'll likely change\n   - They've shown they can adapt when necessary\n   - They might expect me to play Rock again after it worked\n\n7. If they expect me to play Rock again:\n   - Their optimal counter would be Paper\n   - This would give them +3 points\n\n8. Looking at their overall behavior:\n   - Earlier in the game: Very stubborn, repeating moves despite outcomes\n   - Middle of the game: Complete strategy shifts after 5-6 rounds\n   - Recent rounds: More responsive but not perfectly adaptive\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Paper (countering my Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (complete change): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they continue with Scissors (unlikely): Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors anticipates their most logical move (Paper)\n    - This has lower risk than playing Paper (which loses to Scissors)\n    - The reward is lower (+1 vs +3) but more probable\n\n11. Considering their evolution toward more adaptive play:\n    - They're more likely to counter my last successful move\n    - They've shown they learn from losses\n    - Paper is their most logical next move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll switch to Paper to counter my successful Rock play from the previous round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played Scissors three consecutive times\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They lost with Scissors in round 19\n   - But continued with Scissors in round 20\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their earlier behavior of sticking with moves\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've used all three moves in the last three rounds\n\n5. After our tie with mutual Scissors:\n   - Common psychology suggests players often switch after a tie\n   - The natural counter to Scissors is Rock\n   - Many players would expect their opponent to play Rock after a Scissors tie\n\n6. My opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - Early: Long sequences of the same move (particularly Scissors)\n   - Middle: Long sequence of Paper\n   - Recent: More adaptive, but now possibly returning to Scissors persistence\n\n7. Considering their potential approaches:\n   - If they're returning to move persistence: Scissors is likely\n   - If they're being adaptive: Rock is likely (countering expected Scissors)\n   - If they're thinking multiple moves ahead: Paper is possible (countering expected Rock)\n\n8. Looking at their longest patterns:\n   - They played Scissors for 5-6 rounds early in the game\n   - They played Paper for 5 rounds in the middle\n   - They're now on 3 consecutive Scissors\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Scissors again: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. Strategic calculation:\n    - Given their history of move persistence, Scissors remains possible\n    - Given the natural tendency to switch after a tie, Rock is possible\n    - Paper seems least likely as it requires multiple levels of prediction\n\n11. Weighing the evidence:\n    - Their most consistent pattern is sticking with moves for extended sequences\n    - They've now played Scissors three times in a row\n    - The simplest and most aligned prediction is that they may continue with Scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll either continue their Scissors streak (following their pattern of move persistence) or make the most straightforward adaptation by switching to Rock after our tie.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors FOUR consecutive times\n\n3. This confirms their return to move persistence:\n   - Despite losing twice to my Rock with their Scissors\n   - Despite tying once with Scissors\n   - They've continued to play Scissors regardless of outcome\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 19-21: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - I've won twice with Rock against their Scissors\n\n5. This pattern strongly resembles their earlier behavior:\n   - Early in the game, they played Scissors 5-6 times in a row\n   - They appear to be repeating this pattern now\n   - They're currently on a 4-round Scissors streak\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - Their persistence with Scissors despite repeated losses shows remarkable commitment to their pattern\n   - This suggests they might not be strategizing based on outcomes\n   - They might be following a predetermined sequence or simple algorithm\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors (consistent with pattern): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to Rock (to counter my Rock): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper (to counter my expected Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n8. Pattern completion theory:\n   - If they're following their earlier pattern length, they might play Scissors 1-2 more times to complete a 5-6 move sequence\n   - After that, they might switch completely to a different move\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Rock is safest if they continue with Scissors\n   - Playing Paper has highest reward but highest risk\n   - The evidence strongly suggests they'll continue with Scissors\n\n10. Given their demonstrated commitment to patterns despite losses:\n    - The most probable outcome is they continue with Scissors\n    - Their historical behavior suggests pattern completion over adaptation\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock again, anticipating they'll continue their Scissors streak based on their demonstrated pattern persistence and historical behavior.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - Round 22: Paper (significant pattern break)\n\n3. This is an important development:\n   - After 4 consecutive Scissors plays, they switched to Paper\n   - This perfectly countered my Rock play for their biggest win (+3)\n   - They've become more adaptive than I anticipated\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 20-22: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - I repeated Rock and lost badly\n\n5. Their adaptation suggests:\n   - They noticed I was exploiting their Scissors pattern with Rock\n   - They waited until I was confident enough to play Rock twice\n   - Then they countered perfectly with Paper\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After a significant win, they might:\n     a) Continue with Paper after it worked well\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to Scissors and play Rock\n     c) Return to their Scissors pattern\n\n7. Their overall strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Predictable patterns of 5-6 same moves\n   - Mid game: Different predictable patterns\n   - Recent rounds: More adaptive and responsive\n\n8. My missed prediction:\n   - I thought they would complete a 5-6 move Scissors sequence\n   - Instead, they adapted after 4 moves\n   - This suggests they're becoming less predictable\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper after success: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they anticipate my Scissors and play Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they return to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - After my significant loss (-3), I should be more cautious\n    - Playing Scissors is relatively safe (wins vs Paper, loses only -1 to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper is higher risk (loses -1 to Scissors) but higher reward (+3 vs Rock)\n\n11. Most likely scenarios based on their evolution:\n    - They're becoming more adaptive\n    - They recognize patterns and exploit them\n    - After a big win with Paper, continuing with Paper is reasonable\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll either continue with Paper after their significant success or expect me to overthink and play Paper again.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 22-23: Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - After their 4-round Scissors streak, they've played Paper twice in a row\n\n3. Analysis of their recent behavior:\n   - They switched from Scissors to Paper to counter my Rock\n   - They continued with Paper despite losing to my Scissors\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new move sequence with Paper\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 21-23: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I successfully adapted to their Paper with Scissors\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They've shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Their first pattern: 5-6 rounds of Scissors\n   - Their second pattern: 5 rounds of Paper\n   - Their recent pattern: 4 rounds of Scissors followed by 2 rounds of Paper so far\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Paper to my Scissors, they have two likely responses:\n     a) Continue their Paper sequence despite the loss (consistent with earlier behavior)\n     b) Switch to Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. Their historical adaptability:\n   - They've shown they stick with moves despite losses\n   - They've also shown they can make strategic adaptations\n   - The question is whether they're currently in \"pattern mode\" or \"adaptive mode\"\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n9. Weighing probabilities based on their history:\n   - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Paper is still likely\n   - Given they just lost with Paper, Rock is also plausible\n   - Given their overall play style, Scissors seems less likely\n\n10. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors again has moderate risk/reward (wins vs Paper, loses to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper has higher risk/reward (wins big vs Rock, loses to Scissors)\n    - Given their historical preference for move persistence, Scissors may be safer\n\n11. Since they've demonstrated move persistence even after losses:\n    - They might continue with Paper despite the loss\n    - This aligns with their behavior in previous sequences\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, anticipating they'll continue with Paper based on their historical pattern of move persistence even after losses.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

First, let me analyze the point structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Same moves: Tie, no points\n\n2. This is my first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior history to analyze patterns.\n\n3. Looking at expected values:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if the opponent plays rock\n   - Rock and scissors both offer lower rewards (1 point each)\n   - Paper also risks the lowest penalty (-1) compared to rock (-3)\n\n4. Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I should maximize my potential gain while minimizing potential loss.\n\n5. Paper offers the best risk-reward ratio: highest potential gain (3) and lowest potential loss (-1).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

First, let's analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, which means they haven't established a pattern yet.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against rock. However, it also has a potential loss (-1) against scissors.\n\n4. Rock has a moderate reward (+1) against scissors but a high potential loss (-3) against paper.\n\n5. Scissors has a moderate reward (+1) against paper but a moderate loss (-1) against rock.\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a new player with no established patterns, I should consider what most people tend to play first. Many players often choose rock in their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n7. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (gaining +3 points).\n\n8. Even if they don't play rock, paper is not the worst option: against scissors I'd lose only 1 point, and against paper it would be a tie.\n\n9. The expected value calculation suggests paper might be the optimal first move given the payoff structure and lack of information about my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n",

Since the payoff for winning with paper is higher (+3 vs +1), playing paper has the highest potential reward.\n\n3. However, if my opponent also analyzes this way, they might prefer to play scissors to counter paper.\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to use.\n\n5. Without knowledge of my opponent's tendencies, I should consider that rock is psychologically often chosen first by many players in RPS.\n\n6. Given the payoff matrix, paper would be a good counter to this common first move, giving me a chance at the highest possible gain (+3).\n\n7. The risk of playing paper is that if my opponent plays scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n8. The expected value of playing paper appears higher than rock or scissors in this first round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n",

This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins against Rock.\n\n4. However, Paper also risks losing to Scissors (-1 points).\n\n5. Rock is safer in that it can only lose 3 points (to Paper) but can win 1 point (against Scissors).\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what a typical first move might be.\n\n7. Many players choose Rock as a first move, as it's a common intuitive choice.\n\n8. Given that Paper beats Rock for the highest point gain (+3), and this is the first round with no prior information, Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for the potential higher payoff against a likely Rock throw.\n\n[move] Paper\n",
        "I need to carefully think through my strategy for this rock-paper-scissors variant with asymmetric scoring.\n\nSteps:\n1.

Since this is our first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Let me analyze the expected value for each move:\n   - Rock: Wins against scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Wins against rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Wins against paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n4. Without knowing opponent tendencies, if moves were chosen randomly:\n   - Rock expected value: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d7(-3) + (1/3)\u00d70 = -2/3\n   - Paper expected value: (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d70 = 2/3\n   - Scissors expected value: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0\n\n5. Based on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\n6.

Psychology suggests opponents often change their move after losing, especially with a significant point loss (-3).\n\n5.

Alternatively, they might switch to Paper themselves, thinking I might choose Rock.\n\n5. Another possibility is that they stick with Rock, either because they have a preference for it or they think I might switch to Scissors expecting them to change.\n\n6. If I assume my opponent is strategic, the most likely adaptation would be for them to switch to Scissors to counter my previous Paper play.\n\n7.

If they stubbornly stick with Rock, I would tie with my Rock play (0 points), which is not ideal but not terrible.\n\n10. Given these considerations, playing Rock provides a good balance of potential gain against their likely Scissors play while limiting losses in other scenarios.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock as my counter-strategy to their likely adaptation.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

Since my opponent just lost to Paper, they might anticipate me playing Paper again and adjust their strategy accordingly.\n\n4. A common response after losing to Paper would be to play Scissors, which beats Paper.\n\n5. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to anticipate their switch to Scissors, and thus they might play Rock again or switch to Paper.\n\n6. I have several options:\n   - Play Paper again, but this risks losing to Scissors (-1 point)\n   - Play Rock, which would beat Scissors (+1 point) but lose to Paper (-3 points)\n   - Play Scissors, which would beat Paper (+1 point) but lose to Rock (-1 point)\n\n7. The most common pattern in RPS is for players to switch their move after losing, so there's a higher probability my opponent will switch to Scissors.\n\n8.

So far, I've won all three rounds and my opponent has shown a clear pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - This is a cycle of Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n5. Based on this pattern, my opponent's next move is likely to be Rock again, continuing their cycle.\n\n6. However, my opponent has lost three times in a row and might recognize they're being predictable.\n   - They might break their pattern to try to win\n   - They might think I'll expect Rock and play Paper to counter it\n\n7. I need to consider two main possibilities:\n   - If they stick to their pattern and play Rock, I should play Paper (win +3)\n   - If they try to outsmart me by playing Scissors, I should play Rock (win +1)\n\n8. Given that they've lost consistently by being predictable, they're more likely to change their strategy than continue it.\n\n9. However, the pattern has been so clear that they might think I wouldn't expect them to continue it.\n\n10. The payoff for correctly predicting Paper beats Rock (+3) is higher than Rock beats Scissors (+1), which makes Paper a more rewarding choice if I'm correct.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll return to Rock either by continuing their pattern or as a strategic choice thinking I wouldn't expect it.\n\n[move] Paper\n",
        "I need to decide on my next move based on the results of all previous rounds. Let me think through my strategy step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Reviewing the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (+3)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (+1)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern so far has been:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This is a clockwise rotation through the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence\n\n3. If this pattern continues, their next logical move would be Rock.\n\n4. However, my opponent might now realize they've been predictable and I've won every round. This could trigger a strategy change.\n\n5. They might notice I've been perfectly countering them each time, which suggests I might be predicting their pattern.\n\n6. Given that I've won all three rounds, my opponent is likely to break their pattern to try something unexpected.\n\n7. They have two options to break their pattern:\n   - Play Paper again (repeating their last move)\n   - Skip Rock and play Scissors instead\n\n8. Since they lost with Paper last time, psychologically, people tend to avoid repeating a losing move. Therefore, they're more likely to skip to Scissors.\n\n9. If I expect them to play Scissors, my best counter would be Rock.\n\n10. Even if they stick to their pattern and play Rock, a Rock vs. Rock outcome would be a tie (0 points) rather than a loss, limiting my downside.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, which counters Scissors if they break their pattern as I expect, or results in a tie if they follow their pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n",
        "I need to determine my next move based on the patterns established in our previous rounds. Let me analyze step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. History of the game so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (+3)\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (+1)\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This is a cycling pattern following the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence\n   - Based on this pattern, they're likely to play Rock next\n\n3. Looking at my pattern:\n   - I've played Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've also been following the same standard sequence\n   - My opponent might notice this and expect me to play Rock next\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If my opponent follows their pattern, they'll play Rock\n   - If I follow my pattern, I'd play Rock, which would tie against their Rock\n   - If they notice my pattern and try to counter it, they might play Paper instead\n\n5. My opponent has lost three times in a row, which may make them:\n   - More desperate to change their strategy\n   - More likely to break their pattern\n   - Possibly aware that I've been winning by correctly predicting their moves\n\n6. Since they've been following a simple pattern and losing consistently, they'll likely break the pattern.\n   \n7. If they think I'll play Rock next (following my pattern), then they'd play Paper to beat my Rock.\n\n8. To counter their expected Paper, I should play Scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, breaking my own pattern, to counter their anticipated Paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",
        "I need to determine my next move based on the results of all previous rounds. Let me analyze the pattern carefully.\n\nSteps:\n1. Recap of all rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won +3\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won +1\n\n2. I notice I've won all three rounds, which means I've successfully predicted my opponent's moves each time.\n\n3. My opponent's sequence has been: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors sequence in order.\n\n4. If my opponent continues this pattern, they would play Rock next.\n\n5. However, my opponent has lost three times in a row and might recognize their pattern is being predicted:\n   - They might break their pattern deliberately\n   - They might assume I'll expect Rock and play something else\n   - They might overthink and try a completely new strategy\n\n6. Given that I've won three consecutive times, my opponent is likely becoming frustrated and might:\n   - Either stick exactly to their pattern (playing Rock next)\n   - Or completely break their pattern to try to catch me off guard\n\n7. If they play Rock next, Paper would be my best move (+3 points).\n   If they break pattern and play Scissors, Rock would be best.\n   If they play Paper again, Scissors would be best.\n\n8. Considering psychology, after three losses, opponents often break patterns. But they might also think I'll expect them to break the pattern, so they might stick to it.\n\n9. The safest move with the highest potential gain would be Paper:\n   - If they play Rock (continuing pattern): I win +3\n   - If they play Paper (repeating last move): I tie, 0 points\n   - If they play Scissors (breaking pattern): I lose -1\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, betting that either they continue their pattern with Rock or they overthink and play Paper again.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Scissors (repeated Scissors)\n\n3. This is the first round I've lost. My opponent is becoming more successful at anticipating my moves.\n\n4. My opponent has now played Scissors twice in a row, which could indicate:\n   - They found a winning move and are sticking with it\n   - They're trying to establish a pattern to trick me\n   - They believe I'll play Paper again\n\n5. After losing with Paper against Scissors, the obvious counter would be to play Rock.\n\n6. However, my opponent might anticipate this exact thinking and switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock.\n\n7. Looking at my own pattern, I've played:\n   - Round 4: Paper\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Paper\n   So I've been somewhat predictable myself.\n\n8. Since my opponent has stuck with Scissors twice, and it worked for them last time, there's a decent chance they'll play Scissors again expecting me to play Paper again or thinking I won't expect them to use the same move three times.\n\n9. The safest counter to Scissors is Rock, which would give me +1 point if they play Scissors again.\n\n10. If they anticipate my Rock and play Paper instead, I would lose 3 points, which is the worst-case scenario.\n\n11. However, given they've played Scissors twice and it worked last time, Rock seems like the most logical choice to break their winning streak.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their potential third Scissors play, accepting the risk they might anticipate this and switch to Paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent just had their first success by playing Scissors against my Paper. This might encourage them to:\n   - Play Scissors again (since it worked)\n   - Or anticipate I'll change to Rock and switch to Paper\n\n4. After a loss, players often change their strategy. My opponent might expect me to switch from Paper to Rock to counter their Scissors.\n\n5. If my opponent expects me to play Rock, they would logically play Paper.\n\n6. However, my opponent might also stick with Scissors since it just worked for them.\n\n7. I need to break our recent pattern of mutual predictions while also countering their likely move.\n\n8. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - If I play Rock and they play Scissors: I win +1\n   - If I play Rock and they play Paper: I lose -3\n   - If I play Rock and they play Rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n9. The risk of playing Rock is high (-3 if they play Paper), but given they've played Scissors twice in a row, Rock seems like a reasonable counter.\n\n10. Since they just won with Scissors, there's a psychological tendency to repeat a successful move, making Rock a stronger choice for me.\n\n11. Even if they anticipate this and play Paper, I'll have broken the pattern of mutual prediction for future rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their potential third Scissors move in a row, which seems likely after their recent success.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent might play Scissors again.\n\n5. Alternatively, they might anticipate that I'll expect Scissors and switch to Rock to counter my expected Rock.\n\n6. Looking at broader patterns:\n   - My opponent seems to be adapting to counter my moves\n   - We had two ties followed by my loss, which suggests they might be starting to predict my choices\n\n7. I've been using somewhat predictable logic, which my opponent might have identified.\n\n8. To break this pattern, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n\n9. The safest counter to their potential Scissors (if they repeat) is Rock.\n\n10. If they switch to Rock anticipating my Rock, we'd tie.\n\n11. If they switch to Paper anticipating my Rock, I'd lose.\n\n12. Given they've played Scissors twice and won with it last time, psychologically they're most likely to play Scissors again or switch to Rock (thinking I'll play Rock to counter their Scissors).\n\n13.

After losing with Paper against Scissors, my natural reaction would be to play Rock.\n   - My opponent might anticipate this and play Paper to counter\n   - However, they might also expect me to overthink and stick with Scissors\n\n5. My opponent seems to be getting better at predicting my moves as the game progresses:\n   - I won the first three rounds\n   - Then two ties\n   - Now I've lost a round\n\n6. They might be picking up on my tendency to cycle through moves or respond to their previous move.\n\n7. To break any pattern they might be seeing, I need to be less predictable.\n\n8. The safest move against an opponent who has played Scissors twice in a row is Rock:\n   - If they play Scissors again, I win +1\n   - If they play Paper, I lose -3\n   - If they play Rock, we tie (0)\n\n9. While there's a risk of losing 3 points if they play Paper, the recent pattern suggests they favor Scissors.\n\n10. Looking at the overall point structure, I've accumulated 4 points total so far.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 6: Scissors\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Scissors (four Scissors in a row)\n\n3. This is quite remarkable - my opponent has now played Scissors four consecutive times, despite experiencing different outcomes (win, loss, tie).\n\n4. After a tie with our mutual Scissors play, I need to determine what they're likely to play next.\n\n5. There are two main possibilities:\n   - They continue with their Scissors streak (showing unusual commitment to one move)\n   - They finally break the pattern and switch to either Rock or Paper\n\n6. If they maintain their Scissors play, my best counter would be Rock (+1 point).\n\n7. If they anticipate I'll play Rock to counter their potential fifth Scissors, they might switch to Paper.\n\n8. If they switch to Paper and I play Rock, I would lose 3 points.\n\n9. If they switch to Rock and I play Rock, it would be a tie (0 points).\n\n10. Given their unusual commitment to playing Scissors repeatedly, the simplest and most logical response is to play Rock, which directly counters Scissors.\n\n11. However, this would be obvious to them as well, which might prompt them to finally switch to Paper.\n\n12. Considering the payoff structure:\n    - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point (moderate gain, but likely scenario)\n    - Paper loses to Scissors: -1 point (small loss)\n    - Scissors ties with Scissors: 0 points (neutral)\n\n13. Given their consistent pattern of playing Scissors regardless of outcomes, Rock offers the best expected value, even considering the risk they might finally change their strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, betting that my opponent will continue their unusual commitment to playing Scissors, or at least won't switch directly to Paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 6: Scissors\n   - Round 7: Scissors\n   - Round 8: Scissors (four Scissors in a row)\n\n3. This is extraordinary - my opponent has now played Scissors four consecutive times, despite experiencing both losses and ties with this move.\n\n4. This suggests either:\n   - They have a very rigid strategy\n   - They're trying to establish a strong pattern to break later\n   - They believe I won't expect them to play the same move again\n\n5. Looking at my moves, I've played:\n   - Round 6: Paper (lost to Scissors)\n   - Round 7: Rock (won against Scissors)\n   - Round 8: Scissors (tied with Scissors)\n\n6. After our Scissors tie, conventional thinking would suggest we might both switch to Rock (as Rock beats Scissors).\n\n7. However, given my opponent's extraordinary commitment to playing Scissors repeatedly, I need to consider:\n   - Will they finally switch after four consecutive Scissors plays?\n   - Or will they stubbornly continue with Scissors?\n\n8. If they finally switch, the most logical move would be Rock (to beat my expected Scissors).\n\n9. If they stick with Scissors again (which seems unlikely but they've surprised me before), then Rock would be my best response.\n\n10. If I play Rock:\n    - It beats their Scissors if they continue this pattern (+1)\n    - It ties with their Rock if they switch to that (0)\n    - It loses to their Paper if they make this unlikely big jump (-3)\n\n11. Given their demonstrated pattern rigidity, the possibility of them suddenly jumping to Paper seems lowest, while continuing with Scissors or switching to Rock seem more plausible.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, which covers the two most likely scenarios - them continuing with Scissors or switching to Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's pattern:\n   - Rounds 5-8: They have now played Scissors FOUR times consecutively\n   - This is an extreme commitment to one move despite varied outcomes\n\n3. My opponent has played Scissors in four straight rounds, resulting in:\n   - Two ties (when I also played Scissors)\n   - One win for them (against my Paper)\n   - One loss for them (against my Rock)\n\n4. This suggests either:\n   - An extremely stubborn strategy\n   - A deliberate pattern to establish expectations before breaking it\n   - A simple algorithm that hasn't yet changed its output\n\n5. After four consecutive Scissors plays, including our most recent tie:\n   - There's a chance they'll continue with Scissors, believing in persistence\n   - There's a strong possibility they'll finally change their move\n   - If they change, Rock would be the logical choice to beat my expected Scissors\n\n6. My possible responses:\n   - Play Rock: Beats Scissors, ties with Rock\n   - Play Paper: Loses to Scissors, beats Rock\n   - Play Scissors: Ties with Scissors, beats Paper, loses to Rock\n\n7. Given their extreme commitment to Scissors, I think there's a higher probability they'll either:\n   - Continue with Scissors (out of stubbornness or simple strategy)\n   - Switch to Rock (as a direct counter to expected Scissors)\n\n8. Between these two most likely scenarios, Rock is my safest move:\n   - If they play Scissors again, I win +1\n   - If they switch to Rock, we tie (0)\n   - The only risk is if they switch directly to Paper, which seems less likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, which counters their persistent Scissors strategy and also protects against them switching to Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper.

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 9: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. Important pattern break:\n   - My opponent finally broke their streak of five consecutive Scissors moves\n   - They switched to Paper in Round 10, resulting in a tie\n\n3. My opponent's pattern evolution:\n   - Rounds 5-9: Five consecutive Scissors moves\n   - Round 10: Switched to Paper\n   - This indicates they're now adapting their strategy\n\n4. Analyzing their strategy shift:\n   - Their switch to Paper was likely anticipating my Rock (which I had played twice recently and won with)\n   - However, I also switched to Paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests we may be applying similar reasoning\n\n5. Predicting their next move:\n   - After a tie with Paper-Paper, they need to determine what I'll play next\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors to counter their Paper\n   - If they expect me to play Scissors, they would logically play Rock\n\n6. My options:\n   - Play Rock: Beats Scissors, loses to Paper, ties with Rock\n   - Play Paper: Ties with Paper, beats Rock, loses to Scissors\n   - Play Scissors: Beats Paper, loses to Rock, ties with Scissors\n\n7. Strategic assessment:\n   - Now that my opponent has shown they'll adapt, I expect more strategic play\n   - Their most recent move (Paper) suggests they're thinking at least one step ahead\n   - If they expect me to counter their Paper with Scissors, Rock would be their optimal choice\n\n8. Advanced game theory:\n   - If they played Paper expecting my Rock, but got a tie instead, they might predict I'll play Scissors next\n   - To counter this, they would play Rock\n   - My counter to their expected Rock would be Paper\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Paper is risky if they play Scissors (-1 point)\n   - Playing Rock is safe against Scissors (+1 point) but loses badly to Paper (-3 points)\n   - Playing Scissors beats Paper (+1 point) but loses to Rock (-1 point)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock. Given that they just switched to Paper and might expect me to play Scissors to counter, Rock is the most strategic move to counter their likely Rock play. This breaks the cycle of mutual prediction.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 5-9: They played Scissors five consecutive times\n   - Round 10: They finally switched to Paper\n\n3. This pattern change is significant:\n   - After 5 consecutive Scissors plays, they've broken their pattern\n   - They correctly anticipated my switch to Paper (resulting in a tie)\n   - This suggests they may be more strategic than previously thought\n\n4. My opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They saw I played Rock twice recently and won\n   - They correctly predicted I would switch to Paper to counter their expected Rock\n   - This shows adaptive thinking and potential multi-level reasoning\n\n5. For their next move, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with Paper, expecting me to play Paper again or Rock\n   - Switch to Scissors, anticipating I'll play Paper again\n   - Switch to Rock, trying to reset the pattern or counter my potential Scissors\n\n6. Given they just switched from a long Scissors streak to Paper and tied:\n   - They might feel validated in changing their strategy\n   - They might continue adapting rather than locking into a new move\n   - They likely believe I'm tracking their patterns\n\n7. Since we both just played Paper, common psychology suggests:\n   - I might play Scissors to beat their Paper\n   - They might anticipate this and play Rock\n   - Or they might stick with Paper expecting me to overthink\n\n8.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 10: Paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 12: Paper (lost)\n\n3. Looking at my opponent's overall pattern:\n   - They played Scissors for many rounds (dominant strategy)\n   - Then briefly switched to Paper in Round 10 (tie)\n   - Returned to Scissors in Round 11 (lost)\n   - Back to Paper in Round 12 (lost)\n\n4. This suggests they're now alternating between Paper and Scissors. They have yet to play Rock in recent rounds.\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Round 10: Paper\n   - Round 11: Rock\n   - Round 12: Scissors\n   I've been cycling through all three moves.\n\n6. If they're establishing an alternating Scissors-Paper pattern, they would play Scissors next.\n\n7. However, they've lost two rounds in a row and might be more likely to try a completely different strategy, potentially introducing Rock which they haven't played recently.\n\n8. If they expect me to anticipate their Scissors-Paper pattern, they might play Scissors expecting me to play Paper.\n\n9. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play Scissors (continuation of alternating pattern): Rock wins\n   - If they play Paper (breaking the pattern): Scissors wins\n   - If they play Rock (completely new approach): Paper wins\n\n10. Given they've lost with both Scissors and Paper recently, and considering they haven't played Rock in a while, Rock becomes more likely as a fresh approach.\n\n11. Playing Paper would be my safest move as it:\n    - Beats Rock if they switch to it\n    - Only loses 1 point to Scissors if they continue alternating\n    - Has the highest potential gain (+3)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they might switch to Rock as a completely fresh approach after losing with both Scissors and Paper, while accepting the moderate risk they might play Scissors again.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

Opponent movement analysis:\n   - They're now alternating between Paper and Scissors in the most recent rounds\n   - They haven't played Rock since the very first round\n   - They've lost the last two consecutive rounds\n\n4. My recent success:\n   - I've won the last two rounds with different moves (Rock, then Scissors)\n   - I've been correctly anticipating my opponent's moves\n   - I'm demonstrating adaptability while they seem to be following a more rigid pattern\n\n5. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing with Paper, my opponent likely expects me to play Scissors again\n   - They would logically counter with Rock\n   - However, given they haven't played Rock in 11 rounds, this would be a significant pattern break\n\n6. Pattern recognition:\n   - Their recent Paper-Scissors-Paper sequence suggests they might play Scissors next\n   - But they've lost with both moves recently and may be seeking a new strategy\n   - The absence of Rock in their play history is very notable\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Rock (to counter my Scissors): I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If they play Paper again (repeating despite loss): I should play Scissors (+1)\n   - If they play Scissors (alternating pattern): I should play Rock (+1)\n\n8.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 10: Paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: Scissors (lost)\n   - Round 12: Paper (lost)\n\n3. The opponent's overall pattern:\n   - Heavy preference for Scissors (7 out of 12 rounds)\n   - Paper played 3 times\n   - Rock played only in Round 1\n   - They appear to oscillate between Paper and Scissors with rare Rock plays\n\n4. Recent behavior analysis:\n   - They broke their Scissors streak to play Paper (Round 10)\n   - Returned to Scissors (Round 11) and lost\n   - Tried Paper again (Round 12) and lost\n   - This suggests they're trying different moves but not in a sophisticated way\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Round 10: Paper\n   - Round 11: Rock\n   - Round 12: Scissors\n   - I've now played all three moves in sequence\n\n6. The opponent might recognize I've played Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ? and try to predict my next move.\n\n7. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing with Paper to my Scissors, the opponent has two likely reactions:\n     - Switch to Rock (to beat my expected Scissors)\n     - Return to Scissors (their default move)\n   - Given their history, returning to Scissors seems more likely than adapting to Rock\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play Rock (adapting): Paper beats Rock\n   - If they play Scissors (returning to default): Rock beats Scissors\n   - If they play Paper again (stubbornness): Scissors beats Paper\n\n9. In their 12 moves so far:\n   - Rock: 1 time (8.3%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (25%)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (66.7%)\n   \n   This strongly suggests Scissors is their preferred move, which they return to when uncertain.\n\n10.

Critical observation: My opponent played Paper twice in a row (rounds 12-13) and won with it in the last round.\n\n4. Their pattern has evolved:\n   - Early game: Mostly Scissors (rounds 2, 5-9, 11)\n   - Mid-late game: Increased Paper usage (rounds 10, 12-13)\n   - They've now played Paper 3 out of the last 4 rounds\n\n5.

Opponent's most recent pattern (rounds 10-14):\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper THREE times consecutively\n   - This is a significant pattern shift from their earlier Scissors preference\n\n3. Results of recent rounds:\n   - Round 13: They won with Paper against my Rock\n   - Round 14: They lost with Paper against my Scissors\n   - Despite losing in Round 14, they've stuck with Paper for three consecutive rounds\n\n4. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing with Paper to my Scissors, they will likely change their move\n   - They've shown they can stick with a strategy even after losses (as with their earlier Scissors streak)\n   - But three consecutive Papers and a recent loss suggests a high probability of change\n\n5. The most logical responses from my opponent:\n   - Switch to Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n   - Switch to Scissors to mix up their strategy\n   - Continue with Paper (least likely given their recent loss)\n\n6. My recent moves:\n   - Round 12: Scissors (won)\n   - Round 13: Rock (lost)\n   - Round 14: Scissors (won)\n   - I've played Scissors in 2 of the last 3 rounds, both successfully\n\n7. My opponent may expect:\n   - That I'll play Scissors again after it worked\n   - Or that I'll mix up my strategy to be less predictable\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Rock (most logical counter): Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock would win (+1)\n   - If they stay with Paper: Scissors would win (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper is high risk/reward (wins +3 against Rock, loses -1 to Scissors)\n   - Rock is moderate risk (wins +1 against Scissors, loses -3 to Paper)\n   - Scissors is now highest risk after I've used it successfully twice (they're most likely to counter it)\n\n10. Given that they've lost to Scissors and played Paper three times in a row:\n    - The highest probability is they'll switch to Rock to counter my Scissors\n    - This makes Paper my optimal play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll switch to Rock to counter my recent successful Scissors plays.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - They've now played Paper THREE times consecutively (rounds 12-14)\n   - Before that, they alternated more frequently\n\n3. This consistent Paper play is notable:\n   - It won them 3 points in round 13\n   - But lost them 1 point in rounds 12 and 14\n   - Despite losing twice with Paper to my Scissors, they persisted with it\n\n4. My recent plays and results:\n   - Round 12: Scissors vs Paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 13: Rock vs Paper - I lost (-3)\n   - Round 14: Scissors vs Paper - I won (+1)\n\n5. Psychological assessment:\n   - My opponent has shown a surprising commitment to Paper despite losses\n   - This suggests either:\n     - A predetermined pattern they're following\n     - A belief I'll switch to Rock after winning with Scissors\n     - An inability to adapt quickly to losses\n\n6. Their potential next moves:\n   - Continue with Paper a fourth time (which would be highly unusual)\n   - Switch to Rock (anticipating I'll play Scissors again after it worked)\n   - Switch to Scissors (completely changing strategy)\n\n7. After losing twice with Paper against my Scissors, logic strongly suggests they should change their move.\n\n8. The most rational move for them would be Rock, as it beats my successful Scissors play.\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Rock (most logical): Paper beats Rock (+3)\n   - If they play Scissors (complete change): Rock beats Scissors (+1)\n   - If they stubbornly play Paper again: Scissors beats Paper (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Paper is higher reward if they play Rock, but risks losing to Scissors\n    - Playing Rock is safer against potential Scissors, but loses to continued Paper\n    - Continuing with Scissors only wins if they inexplicably play Paper again\n\n11.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 12-15: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've now played Paper four consecutive times\n\n3. Results of these Paper plays:\n   - Lost to my Scissors in Round 12\n   - Won against my Rock in Round 13 (+3)\n   - Lost to my Scissors in Round 14\n   - Tied with my Paper in Round 15\n\n4. This consistent use of Paper despite mixed results suggests:\n   - A predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - Very limited adaptability (similar to their earlier Scissors streak)\n   - Possible attempt to establish a pattern before breaking it\n\n5. Psychological analysis:\n   - They've persisted with Paper despite two losses and a tie\n   - This mirrors their earlier persistence with Scissors\n   - They seem to commit to moves for extended periods regardless of results\n\n6. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 13-15: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - I've been cycling through all three options\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - After four consecutive Paper plays by my opponent, including a tie in the last round:\n     - They might finally switch away from Paper\n     - They might continue with Paper despite its mixed results\n     - If they change, Rock would be logical to counter my potential Scissors\n\n8. If they maintain their pattern-based strategy:\n   - Given their history of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, Paper remains likely\n   - But the tie might motivate them to finally switch\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Paper again: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Given their demonstrated behavior:\n    - They tend to stick with moves for extended periods\n    - They've played Paper four times consecutively\n    - After the tie, they might be more likely to change than after losses\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll either continue their Paper streak or that the change probability isn't high enough to justify a different play. This is the safest play with a reasonable chance of success.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My recent moves:\n   - I've played Scissors in rounds 14 and 16, winning both times\n   - I played Paper in round 15, resulting in a tie\n\n5. Behavioral analysis of opponent:\n   - They show extreme move persistence regardless of outcomes\n   - Their pattern suggests they play in streaks before completely changing\n   - Their first streak was Scissors (5 times), now it's Paper (5 times)\n   - Based on previous behavior, they might finally change after 5 Paper plays\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing with Paper to Scissors three times (including twice in a row now)\n   - They have strong motivation to change their strategy\n   - If they follow their previous pattern, five consecutive plays might be their threshold\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n8.

My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 12-16: Five consecutive Paper plays\n   - Round 17: Switched to Rock\n   - This confirms my theory that they tend to use a move 5-6 times before changing\n\n3. My prediction was correct:\n   - I anticipated they would switch to Rock after completing their 5-move Paper sequence\n   - I played Paper and won significantly (+3 points)\n\n4. Analysis of opponent's behavior patterns:\n   - They show commitment to single moves for extended sequences\n   - They eventually adapt but in predictable ways\n   - After playing Rock in round 17, they might:\n     a) Start a sequence of Rock plays\n     b) Continue adapting and switch to countering my expected move\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 14-17: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - I've been alternating between Paper and Scissors\n\n6. If the opponent is observant, they might:\n   - Notice my alternating pattern\n   - Expect me to play Scissors next (continuing the alternation)\n   - Play Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. However, if they're following their own pattern:\n   - They might continue with Rock for several rounds\n   - Regardless of the outcome of each round\n\n8. Psychological factors:\n   - They just lost significantly with Rock against my Paper (-3 points)\n   - This might motivate them to change strategies\n   - But their history shows they often persist with moves despite losses\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (countering my expected Paper): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (complete strategy change): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. Strategic calculation:\n    - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Rock is fairly likely\n    - Given they just lost badly, Scissors is also a reasonable possibility\n    - Given my alternating pattern, they might expect Scissors and play Rock\n\n11. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Paper has the highest reward (+3) if they play Rock again\n    - Rock is safest against potential Scissors\n    - Either Paper or Rock seems justified based on different reasoning\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll either continue with Rock (following their pattern of persistence) or play Rock to counter my expected Scissors (if they noticed my alternating pattern).\n\n[move] Paper\n",

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern shift:\n   - After 5 consecutive Paper plays, they've switched to Rock\n   - This confirms their pattern of persistence followed by change\n\n3. Their overall pattern structure:\n   - First phase: 5-6 rounds primarily with Scissors\n   - Second phase: 5 rounds exclusively with Paper\n   - Now: Potentially beginning a new phase with Rock\n\n4. My predictions have been accurate:\n   - I correctly anticipated their switch to Rock after completing their Paper sequence\n   - I've won the last three rounds using different moves\n   - My understanding of their pattern-based strategy is working\n\n5. Their potential thinking:\n   - They've just lost with Rock to my Paper (-3 points)\n   - They might expect me to play Paper again after it worked well\n   - Logical counter to Paper would be Scissors\n\n6. Alternatively:\n   - They might stick with Rock despite losing (consistent with their persistence pattern)\n   - They might think I wouldn't expect them to play Rock twice after losing\n   - They might think I'd avoid Paper after it worked too well\n\n7. My recent success:\n   - I've won the last 3 rounds\n   - I've correctly predicted their moves by understanding their pattern structure\n   - I should continue to leverage this understanding\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Scissors (countering my expected Paper): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they stick with Rock (consistent with persistence pattern): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper (complete pattern change): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Pattern probability:\n   - Based on their established behavior pattern of persistence:\n     - They might be starting a new sequence with Rock\n     - If so, Rock is their most likely next move\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) if they stick with Rock\n    - Playing Rock is safer with a lower reward (+1) if they switch to Scissors\n    - Their demonstrated tendency is to stick with moves for multiple rounds\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper again, anticipating they'll stick with Rock for at least another round based on their established pattern of move persistence despite losses.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

My opponent's pattern has dramatically shifted:\n   - Rounds 12-16: Five consecutive Paper plays\n   - Round 17: Switched to Rock\n   - This confirms their pattern of playing the same move 5-6 times before changing\n\n3. Previous patterns:\n   - First they played mostly Scissors for about 5-6 rounds\n   - Then they played Paper for exactly 5 rounds\n   - Now they've switched to Rock\n\n4. My prediction from last round was correct:\n   - I anticipated they would switch to Rock after their 5-move Paper sequence\n   - I played Paper and won +3 points\n\n5. My opponent's behavior suggests:\n   - They follow distinct \"phases\" of 5-6 moves with one dominant choice\n   - They likely just entered a \"Rock phase\"\n   - They tend to stick with moves despite losses\n\n6. My recent moves:\n   - Round 15: Paper (tie)\n   - Round 16: Scissors (won)\n   - Round 17: Paper (won significantly)\n\n7. Psychological analysis:\n   - After losing significantly with Rock (-3), they might be tempted to switch\n   - However, their established pattern suggests they'll persist with Rock\n   - They seem to follow predetermined sequences rather than adapting to outcomes\n\n8.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played Scissors three consecutive times\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They lost with Scissors in round 19\n   - But continued with Scissors in round 20\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their earlier behavior of sticking with moves\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've used all three moves in the last three rounds\n\n5.

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Scissors (three consecutive Scissors plays)\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They lost with Scissors in round 19\n   - Yet they played Scissors again in round 20\n   - This suggests a possible return to their earlier pattern of move persistence\n\n4. My recent moves and outcomes:\n   - Round 18: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 19: Rock (won)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (tie)\n\n5. After our Scissors tie:\n   - Common psychology suggests people often switch after a tie\n   - My opponent might expect me to switch to Rock (which beats Scissors)\n   - If they anticipate my Rock, they might play Paper\n\n6. However, looking at their persistence with Scissors:\n   - They've now played Scissors three times in a row\n   - This mirrors their earlier behavior of sticking with moves\n   - They might continue with Scissors despite the tie\n\n7. Pattern recognition:\n   - Early game: 5-6 rounds of mostly Scissors\n   - Mid game: 5 rounds of exclusively Paper\n   - Recent rounds: Return to Scissors preference?\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (anticipating my Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (complete change): Paper wins (+3)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Rock has good odds if they continue their Scissors streak\n   - Playing Rock also ties if they switch to Rock\n   - Playing Rock only loses if they accurately predict and play Paper\n\n10. Considering their demonstrated move persistence throughout the game:\n    - There's a significant chance they'll play Scissors again\n    - The evidence for persistence outweighs the common psychology of switching after a tie\n    - Their behavior pattern throughout the game suggests commitment to moves\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll either continue their Scissors streak or fail to make the double-level prediction that I'd switch to Paper after our Scissors tie.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Round 18: Scissors (won against my Paper)\n   - Round 19: Scissors (lost against my Rock)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (tied with my Scissors)\n   - They've now played Scissors three rounds in a row\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They previously played Paper five times in a row\n   - Before that, they played Scissors extensively\n   - They might be returning to a pattern of sticking with one move\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Round 18: Paper (lost)\n   - Round 19: Rock (won)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (tied)\n   - I've played all three options in the last three rounds\n\n5. After our tie with mutual Scissors:\n   - Common psychology suggests players often shift to Rock after a Scissors tie\n   - This is because Rock beats the previous move (Scissors)\n   - This is a natural tendency in RPS games\n\n6. Opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They might continue their Scissors streak despite mixed results\n   - They might anticipate I'll play Rock to beat their Scissors\n   - If they think I'll play Rock, they might play Paper\n\n7. Their overall pattern suggests:\n   - They tend to stick with moves for extended periods\n   - They occasionally adapt but not consistently\n   - They've played Scissors more than any other move throughout the game\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (anticipating my Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (breaking pattern): Paper wins (+3)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Rock is relatively safe given their pattern of Scissors plays\n   - Playing Paper is higher risk but higher reward if they switch to Rock\n   - Since they've played Scissors in 3 consecutive rounds, Rock seems logical\n\n10. Considering their historical tendency for move persistence:\n    - There's a good chance they'll play Scissors again\n    - After a tie, they might be less likely to change than after a loss\n    - Rock would be my safest counter to their potential Scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll continue their pattern of playing Scissors, or at least considering it's the most probable outcome based on their demonstrated behavior.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors FOUR consecutive times\n\n3. This is a strong return to their earlier behavior:\n   - Earlier, they played Scissors for 5-6 consecutive rounds\n   - Then Paper for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - Now Scissors again for 4 consecutive rounds\n\n4. Results of their recent Scissors plays:\n   - Round 18: They won with Scissors vs my Paper\n   - Round 19: They lost with Scissors vs my Rock\n   - Round 20: They tied with Scissors vs my Scissors\n   - Round 21: They lost with Scissors vs my Rock\n\n5. Despite losing twice with Scissors to my Rock:\n   - They've continued to play Scissors\n   - This confirms their tendency for move persistence regardless of outcomes\n\n6. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 19-21: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - I've won both times I played Rock (against their Scissors)\n\n7. Psychological considerations:\n   - My opponent has shown they can be predictable for extended sequences\n   - They've now lost twice with Scissors against Rock\n   - If they follow their earlier pattern, they might still continue with Scissors\n   - But the repeated losses may finally trigger a change\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors (consistent with persistence): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (countering my expected Rock): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper (complete strategy change): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Based on their history, they might play Scissors a fifth time\n   - However, after losing twice with Scissors to Rock, adaptation is increasingly likely\n   - They've shown they eventually change strategies after 5-6 rounds\n\n10. Pattern completion consideration:\n    - If they're following their earlier pattern, they might play Scissors once more\n      to complete a 5-round sequence before changing\n    - This would align with their behavior in the first half of the game\n\n11. Higher-level thinking:\n    - They might expect me to play Rock again after it worked twice\n    - If so, they would switch to Paper to counter\n    - However, their history suggests they don't consistently employ this level of reasoning\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock again, anticipating they'll either complete their Scissors sequence (for a fifth round) or fail to adapt quickly enough despite their recent losses.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is a significant shift:\n   - They played Paper at exactly the right time to counter my Rock\n   - They won significantly (+3 for them)\n   - This shows strategic adaptation rather than pattern persistence\n\n4. Looking back at my opponent's behavior:\n   - They've shown periods of move persistence (Scissors early, Paper mid-game)\n   - But they've also shown strategic adaptability at key moments\n   - They might be combining pattern play with occasional strategic moves\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 20-22: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - I repeated Rock and lost badly\n\n6.

My opponent's pattern has changed:\n   - After 4 consecutive Scissors plays, they switched to Paper\n   - This broke their apparent return to move persistence\n   - It was a successful counter to my Rock\n\n3. Analyzing their broader patterns:\n   - Early game: Scissors streak for ~5-6 rounds\n   - Mid game: Paper streak for 5 rounds\n   - Recent: Scissors streak for 4 rounds, then Paper\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Following sequences of predetermined length\n   - Adapting occasionally when they recognize a pattern in my play\n   - Using a more complex strategy than initially appeared\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 20-22: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - I repeated Rock and lost badly (-3 points)\n\n6.

Psychological considerations:\n   - They just won significantly (+3) with Paper\n   - This success might encourage them to stick with Paper\n   - Similar to how they stuck with Scissors after occasional successes\n\n8. My pattern has become predictable:\n   - I've played Rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - I've won with Rock multiple times against their Scissors\n   - They successfully countered with Paper\n\n9.

Risk assessment:\n    - After their significant win with Paper, continuing with Paper is a reasonable strategy for them\n    - Given their historical pattern persistence, they might stick with Paper for multiple rounds\n    - If I were them, I would continue with the move that just gave a big win\n\n11. Breaking the cycle:\n    - I need to avoid being predictable with Rock\n    - Scissors is the logical counter to their expected Paper\n    - This would break my pattern of frequent Rock plays\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll continue with Paper after their significant win against my Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

Psychological assessment:\n   - They lost with Paper to my Scissors\n   - Based on their history, they might:\n     a) Continue with Paper despite the loss (consistent with their pattern behavior)\n     b) Switch to Rock to counter my successful Scissors\n     c) Return to Scissors (less likely given their sequence patterns)\n\n8. Looking at their full game behavior:\n   - They've played Scissors the most (11 times)\n   - Followed by Paper (8 times)\n   - Rock only 4 times\n\n9. They seem to prefer moves in this order:\n   - Scissors (most frequent)\n   - Paper (second most frequent)\n   - Rock (least frequent)\n\n10. Strategic options:\n    - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n    - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n    - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n11. Risk assessment:\n    - Given their pattern behavior, Paper is a reasonable possibility\n    - But they also might switch to Rock to counter my successful Scissors\n    - Their least likely move is Scissors based on their pattern of sequences\n\n12. Considering their historical patterns:\n    - They've shown they can play Paper for multiple rounds\n    - They've shown they don't always change after losses\n    - But they've also shown increasing adaptation\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, anticipating they'll continue with Paper despite their loss. This is based on their historical tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds even after losses. If I'm wrong and they switch to Rock, I'll only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",
        "I need to analyze our complete game history to determine my next move. Let me think through this step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n1. Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper.

I lost -3 points.\n   - Round 23: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 22-23: Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - After their 4-round Scissors streak, they've played Paper twice in a row\n\n3. Analysis of their recent behavior:\n   - They switched from Scissors to Paper to counter my Rock\n   - They continued with Paper despite losing to my Scissors\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new move sequence with Paper\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 21-23: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I successfully adapted to their Paper with Scissors\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They've shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Their first pattern: 5-6 rounds of Scissors\n   - Their second pattern: 5 rounds of Paper\n   - Their recent pattern: 4 rounds of Scissors followed by 2 rounds of Paper so far\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Paper to my Scissors, they have two likely responses:\n     a) Continue their Paper sequence despite the loss (consistent with earlier behavior)\n     b) Switch to Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. Their historical adaptability:\n   - They've shown they stick with moves despite losses\n   - They've also shown they can make strategic adaptations\n   - The question is whether they're currently in \"pattern mode\" or \"adaptive mode\"\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n9. Weighing probabilities based on their history:\n   - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Paper is still likely\n   - Given they just lost with Paper, Rock is also plausible\n   - Given their overall play style, Scissors seems less likely\n\n10. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors again has moderate risk/reward (wins vs Paper, loses to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper has higher risk/reward (wins big vs Rock, loses to Scissors)\n    - Given their historical preference for move persistence, Scissors may be safer\n\n11. Since they've demonstrated move persistence even after losses:\n    - They might continue with Paper despite the loss\n    - This aligns with their behavior in previous sequences\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, anticipating they'll continue with Paper based on their historical pattern of move persistence even after losses.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 22-23: Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper twice consecutively\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They won big with Paper in round 22 (+3)\n   - They stuck with Paper in round 23 despite losing (-1)\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their pattern of move persistence\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 21-23: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I switched to Scissors after losing with Rock and won\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - Earlier: They showed patterns of 5-6 consecutive same moves\n   - Recently: They played 4 Scissors, then switched to Paper\n   - Current: They've played Paper twice consecutively\n\n6. If they're returning to move persistence:\n   - They might continue with Paper for several more rounds\n   - Regardless of outcomes\n\n7. Psychological considerations:\n   - They lost with Paper to my Scissors\n   - But their history suggests they often continue moves despite losses\n   - They might believe I won't expect them to play Paper a third time\n\n8. If they're becoming more adaptive:\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again after it worked\n   - Their counter would be Rock\n   - Or they might try to counter my potential Rock with Paper\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (countering my Scissors): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (complete change): Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors again is relatively safe if they continue with Paper\n    - Playing Rock is safer against their potential switch to Scissors\n    - Playing Paper is riskiest but highest reward if they play Rock\n\n11. Pattern recognition:\n    - Their behavior shows they often stick with moves for multiple rounds\n    - We've seen this with both Scissors and Paper previously\n    - This suggests Paper again is reasonably likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, anticipating they'll continue with Paper for a third time (following their historical pattern of move persistence) or expecting me to overthink and switch away from my successful Scissors play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

This is noteworthy:\n   - They played Paper in round 22 and won big (+3)\n   - They played Paper again in round 23 despite losing\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new pattern of Paper plays\n\n4. Their pattern behavior throughout the game:\n   - Rounds 1-11: Mostly Scissors (especially rounds 5-11)\n   - Rounds 12-16: Mostly Paper (5 consecutive Paper plays)\n   - Rounds 17-21: Mixed, then 4 consecutive Scissors\n   - Rounds 22-23: 2 consecutive Paper plays\n\n5. My recent moves and results:\n   - Round 21: Rock (won vs Scissors)\n   - Round 22: Rock (lost vs Paper)\n   - Round 23: Scissors (won vs Paper)\n\n6. Potential opponent thinking:\n   - They might be starting another extended Paper sequence\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again after it worked\n   - They might switch to Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. Their adaptation patterns:\n   - They've shown they can adapt (switching from Scissors to Paper in round 22)\n   - But they've also shown persistence with moves despite losses\n   - Their most consistent pattern is playing the same move multiple times\n\n8.

My opponent's most recent moves:\n   - Round 22: Paper (won +3)\n   - Round 23: Paper (lost -1)\n   - They repeated Paper despite having switched from Scissors\n\n3. Looking at their broader pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Four consecutive Scissors plays\n   - Rounds 22-23: Two consecutive Paper plays\n   - This suggests they may be starting a new sequence with Paper\n\n4. My recent moves and results:\n   - Round 21: Rock (won +1)\n   - Round 22: Rock (lost -3)\n   - Round 23: Scissors (won +1)\n\n5. Opponent's adaptation patterns:\n   - Earlier in the game: 5-6 move sequences of the same move\n   - Recently: 4 move sequence of Scissors, now 2 move sequence of Paper\n   - They might be shortening their sequences or becoming more adaptive\n\n6. After losing with Paper to Scissors, they have three main options:\n   - Continue with Paper (consistent with their pattern of persistence)\n   - Switch to Rock (direct counter to my winning Scissors)\n   - Switch to Scissors (complete pattern change)\n\n7. Psychological factors:\n   - They've now lost with Paper after it worked once\n   - If following their historical behavior, they might persist with Paper\n   - If becoming more adaptive, they might counter with Rock\n\n8. Their overall trend:\n   - They started very rigid (long sequences regardless of outcome)\n   - They've shown increasing adaptation over the course of the game\n   - But they still show some tendency toward move persistence\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3) \n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors again is riskiest (loses to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper is safest (wins vs Rock, loses only -1 to Scissors)\n    - Playing Rock is balanced (wins vs Scissors, loses -3 to Paper)\n\n11. Considering their evolution toward adaptation:\n    - They're more likely to counter my successful Scissors with Rock\n    - They've shown they learn from losses\n    - Their pattern persistence has been decreasing\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll switch to Rock to counter my successful Scissors play from the previous round.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
