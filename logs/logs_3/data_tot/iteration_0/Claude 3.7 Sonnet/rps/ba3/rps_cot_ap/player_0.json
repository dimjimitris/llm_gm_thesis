Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I'm playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with a point system:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats Rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats Paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. This is the first round against a fresh player, so I don't have any history to base my decision on.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins against Rock.\n\n4. However, Paper also risks losing to Scissors (-1 points).\n\n5. Rock is safer in that it can only lose 3 points (to Paper) but can win 1 point (against Scissors).\n\n6. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider what a typical first move might be.\n\n7. Many players choose Rock as a first move, as it's a common intuitive choice.\n\n8. Given that Paper beats Rock for the highest point gain (+3), and this is the first round with no prior information, Paper seems like a reasonable strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for the potential higher payoff against a likely Rock throw.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

So far, I've won all three rounds and my opponent has shown a clear pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - This is a cycle of Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n5.

This level of move repetition is highly unusual and suggests:\n   - A predetermined strategy regardless of outcomes\n   - A very simple algorithm or pattern that doesn't adapt\n   - An attempt to establish an extreme pattern before breaking it\n\n4. My analysis of likely next moves:\n   - Given they've lost twice with Scissors against Rock, logic would strongly suggest they change\n   - However, they've demonstrated an unusual commitment to Scissors\n   - If they do change, Rock would be the most logical choice to counter my expected Rock\n\n5. Possible scenarios:\n   - They continue with Scissors (which seems increasingly likely given past behavior)\n   - They finally switch to Rock (to counter my expected Rock)\n   - They switch to Paper (to counter my expected Rock)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play Rock and they play Scissors again: I win +1\n   - If I play Rock and they play Rock: Tie, 0 points\n   - If I play Rock and they play Paper: I lose -3 points\n   - If I play Paper and they play Scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play Paper and they play Rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play Paper and they play Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n7. Strategic consideration:\n   - After five consecutive Scissors plays and two recent losses to Rock, the probability they switch away from Scissors has increased\n   - If they do switch, Paper is their optimal move against my expected Rock\n   - Playing Rock again has worked twice, but carries the highest potential loss (-3 points)\n\n8. Breaking the pattern:\n   - Since I've played Rock twice recently and won, changing to Paper protects against their potential switch to Rock\n   - This would give me the highest payoff (+3) if they do finally adjust\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they will finally break their Scissors pattern and switch to Rock, while accepting the risk they might stubbornly play Scissors again.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 9: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played Paper, opponent played Paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 5-9: They played Scissors five consecutive times\n   - Round 10: They finally switched to Paper\n\n3. This pattern change is significant:\n   - After 5 consecutive Scissors plays, they've broken their pattern\n   - They correctly anticipated my switch to Paper (resulting in a tie)\n   - This suggests they may be more strategic than previously thought\n\n4. My opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They saw I played Rock twice recently and won\n   - They correctly predicted I would switch to Paper to counter their expected Rock\n   - This shows adaptive thinking and potential multi-level reasoning\n\n5. For their next move, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with Paper, expecting me to play Paper again or Rock\n   - Switch to Scissors, anticipating I'll play Paper again\n   - Switch to Rock, trying to reset the pattern or counter my potential Scissors\n\n6. Given they just switched from a long Scissors streak to Paper and tied:\n   - They might feel validated in changing their strategy\n   - They might continue adapting rather than locking into a new move\n   - They likely believe I'm tracking their patterns\n\n7. Since we both just played Paper, common psychology suggests:\n   - I might play Scissors to beat their Paper\n   - They might anticipate this and play Rock\n   - Or they might stick with Paper expecting me to overthink\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Paper again and I play Scissors: I win +1\n   - If they switch to Scissors and I play Rock: I win +1\n   - If they switch to Rock and I play Paper: I win +3\n\n9. Given their demonstrated adaptability in the last round after a long pattern:\n   - They're more likely to change moves again than start another streak\n   - Scissors would be a logical counter to our mutual Paper play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll switch to Scissors to counter my expected Paper or Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 5-9: Five consecutive Scissors plays\n   - Round 10: Switched to Paper (tied)\n   - Round 11: Returned to Scissors (lost)\n\n3. This is fascinating behavior:\n   - They briefly broke their Scissors streak with Paper\n   - But immediately returned to Scissors despite losing with it repeatedly\n   - This suggests either a predetermined pattern or very limited adaptability\n\n4. My recent moves and results:\n   - Round 9: Rock vs. Scissors - I won\n   - Round 10: Paper vs. Paper - Tie\n   - Round 11: Rock vs. Scissors - I won\n\n5. Overall pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent has played Scissors in 7 out of 11 rounds\n   - Against my Rock, they've consistently played Scissors and lost\n   - They've only deviated from Scissors once (with Paper)\n\n6. Psychology and game theory considerations:\n   - After returning to Scissors and losing again, they should be highly motivated to change\n   - They might expect me to play Rock again after my recent success\n   - Logical counters to Rock would be Paper\n\n7. The opponent seems to have two modes:\n   - A default \"play Scissors\" mode they return to\n   - Occasional attempts at adaptation that don't persist\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Scissors again (returning to default): Rock wins\n   - If they play Paper (logical adaptation): Scissors wins\n   - If they play Rock (complete strategy change): Paper wins\n\n9. Weighing probabilities:\n   - Given their history, there's still a chance they'll play Scissors again\n   - However, after multiple losses with Scissors to Rock, Paper is their most logical move\n   - Rock seems least likely as it would be an overcorrection\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll finally adapt consistently and play Paper to counter my expected Rock. This breaks my own pattern of playing Rock and accounts for their likely strategic adjustment.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern has shifted in an interesting way:\n   - Rounds 10-12: They alternated Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - Before that, they had played mostly Scissors with one Paper\n\n3. I observe that my opponent is now using Paper more frequently:\n   - Paper in rounds 3, 4, 10, and now 12\n   - This might indicate a shift in their strategy\n\n4. My recent results:\n   - I've won the last two rounds\n   - I won with Rock against Scissors in round 11\n   - I won with Scissors against Paper in round 12\n\n5. Looking at the opponent's pattern from rounds 10-12:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - This could suggest they're developing an alternating pattern\n\n6. If they're following an alternating Paper \u2192 Scissors pattern:\n   - Their next move would logically be Scissors\n\n7. Considering psychological factors:\n   - They just lost with Paper against my Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors again after it worked\n   - To counter expected Scissors, they might play Rock\n\n8. However, they might also recognize:\n   - I've been successfully predicting their moves\n   - I've won most rounds\n   - They need to be less predictable\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Scissors (following their alternating pattern): Rock wins\n   - If they play Rock (countering my expected Scissors): Paper wins\n   - If they stay with Paper (being unpredictable): Scissors wins\n\n10. Probability assessment:\n    - Given their recent alternating pattern, Scissors seems most likely\n    - Given they just lost with Paper to Scissors, Rock is a reasonable counter\n    - They seem to be adapting more now than earlier in the game\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll follow their alternating pattern and play Scissors, or switch to Scissors to counter my potential repeat of Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's most recent pattern (rounds 10-13):\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They've played Paper in the last two rounds consecutively\n\n3. This is a significant change:\n   - They appear to have abandoned their earlier preference for Scissors\n   - They've played Paper three times in the last four rounds\n   - They've won with Paper against my Rock (-3 points for me)\n\n4. My opponent may have identified a pattern in my play:\n   - They correctly anticipated my Rock with their Paper\n   - This resulted in their biggest win of the game\n\n5. Looking at my recent moves:\n   - Round 11: Rock (won)\n   - Round 12: Scissors (won)\n   - Round 13: Rock (lost badly)\n   - I've become somewhat predictable by returning to Rock\n\n6. Opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They've found success with Paper against my Rock\n   - They might expect me to switch to Scissors after losing to Paper\n   - If they anticipate Scissors, they may play Rock\n\n7. Alternative analysis:\n   - They might stick with Paper after it worked well\n   - They might think I wouldn't expect them to play Paper three times in a row\n   - Their recent plays suggest increased strategic thinking\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they play Paper again: Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play Rock (anticipating my Scissors): Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they play Scissors (expecting me to play Paper): Rock would win (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Scissors is relatively safe (wins against Paper, loses only -1 to Rock)\n   - Playing Paper is higher risk/reward (wins +3 against Rock, loses -1 to Scissors)\n   - After losing -3 points, I need to be more cautious\n\n10.

Strategic calculation:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n8.

This is extraordinary persistence:\n   - They've lost with Paper THREE times to my Scissors\n   - They've tied once with Paper\n   - They've won once with Paper against Rock\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 14-16: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've played Scissors against their Paper three times and won each time\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent shows an unusual commitment to moves regardless of outcomes\n   - They seem to switch strategies completely after 5-6 rounds with one move\n   - Their first pattern: 5-6 rounds of mostly Scissors\n   - Their current pattern: 5 rounds of exclusively Paper\n\n6. Looking at their full history:\n   - Rounds 1-11: 7 Scissors, 3 Paper, 1 Rock\n   - Rounds 12-16: 5 Paper, 0 Scissors, 0 Rock\n\n7. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Paper three times to Scissors, they have strong reason to change\n   - They've completed a 5-move sequence with Paper (matching their Scissors sequence)\n   - This could be a psychological trigger point for them to switch strategies\n\n8. Potential opponent thinking:\n   - They might finally abandon Paper after repeated losses\n   - If they switch, Rock would be the logical counter to my successful Scissors\n   - They might anticipate I'll continue with Scissors after multiple wins\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Rock (most logical adaptation): Paper would win (+3)\n   - If they continue with Paper (consistent with persistence pattern): Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (complete pattern change): Rock would win (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Playing Paper is higher risk/reward, winning big if they switch to Rock\n    - Playing Scissors is safer if they stubbornly continue with Paper\n    - Given their pattern of eventual adaptation after 5-move sequences, change is likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll finally switch to Rock after completing their 5-move Paper sequence and experiencing multiple losses to Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played Paper, opponent played Paper.

I won +1 point.\n   - Round 17: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won +3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern has shifted:\n   - Rounds 12-16: Five consecutive Paper plays\n   - Round 17: Switched to Rock\n   - This confirms my theory that they tend to use a move 5-6 times before changing\n\n3. My prediction was correct:\n   - I anticipated they would switch to Rock after completing their 5-move Paper sequence\n   - I played Paper and won significantly (+3 points)\n\n4. Analysis of opponent's behavior patterns:\n   - They show commitment to single moves for extended sequences\n   - They eventually adapt but in predictable ways\n   - After playing Rock in round 17, they might:\n     a) Start a sequence of Rock plays\n     b) Continue adapting and switch to countering my expected move\n\n5. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 14-17: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - I've been alternating between Paper and Scissors\n\n6. If the opponent is observant, they might:\n   - Notice my alternating pattern\n   - Expect me to play Scissors next (continuing the alternation)\n   - Play Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. However, if they're following their own pattern:\n   - They might continue with Rock for several rounds\n   - Regardless of the outcome of each round\n\n8. Psychological factors:\n   - They just lost significantly with Rock against my Paper (-3 points)\n   - This might motivate them to change strategies\n   - But their history shows they often persist with moves despite losses\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors (countering my expected Paper): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Paper (complete strategy change): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. Strategic calculation:\n    - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Rock is fairly likely\n    - Given they just lost badly, Scissors is also a reasonable possibility\n    - Given my alternating pattern, they might expect Scissors and play Rock\n\n11. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Paper has the highest reward (+3) if they play Rock again\n    - Rock is safest against potential Scissors\n    - Either Paper or Rock seems justified based on different reasoning\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they'll either continue with Rock (following their pattern of persistence) or play Rock to counter my expected Scissors (if they noticed my alternating pattern).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - After 5 consecutive Paper plays, they switched to Rock (round 17)\n   - Then immediately switched to Scissors (round 18)\n   - This suggests they've abandoned their pattern of extended move sequences\n\n3. I notice they're becoming more adaptive:\n   - They're no longer sticking to one move for multiple rounds\n   - They seem to be actively countering my moves now\n   - They played Scissors to beat my Paper after losing with Rock\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 16-18: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - I repeated Paper and lost\n\n5. Opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They might be noticing my patterns and adapting\n   - They correctly predicted I would play Paper again\n   - They countered successfully with Scissors\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After winning with Scissors, they might:\n     a) Continue with Scissors, expecting me to play Paper again\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to Rock to counter their Scissors\n     c) Switch to Rock to counter my expected Rock\n\n7. Their overall game evolution:\n   - Early game: Very predictable, long sequences of the same move\n   - Mid game: Complete switch to a different long sequence\n   - Recent rounds: More adaptive, responsive play\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (anticipating my Rock): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Given their recent adaptation, continued adaptation is likely\n   - Given their success with Scissors, they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to play Rock to counter their Scissors\n\n10. Double-level thinking:\n    - They'll expect me to switch to Rock after losing to Scissors\n    - If they think I'll play Rock, they might play Paper\n    - However, this assumes a high level of strategic thinking\n\n11. Considering their overall pattern recognition:\n    - They've become more responsive to my moves\n    - They've started to break their own patterns\n    - But they might not yet be thinking multiple moves ahead\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll either continue with Scissors after their success or fail to anticipate that I'll switch from Paper to Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's most recent pattern:\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors (repeated Scissors)\n\n3. They've played Scissors in the last two rounds:\n   - First time, they won against my Paper\n   - Second time, they lost against my Rock\n\n4. My recent moves and outcomes:\n   - Round 17: Paper (won +3)\n   - Round 18: Paper (lost -1)\n   - Round 19: Rock (won +1)\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - My opponent had previously shown a pattern of sticking with moves for 5+ rounds\n   - Recently they've become more adaptive\n   - But they just repeated Scissors despite losing with it\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing with Scissors to Rock, they'll likely change\n   - They've shown they can adapt when necessary\n   - They might expect me to play Rock again after it worked\n\n7. If they expect me to play Rock again:\n   - Their optimal counter would be Paper\n   - This would give them +3 points\n\n8. Looking at their overall behavior:\n   - Earlier in the game: Very stubborn, repeating moves despite outcomes\n   - Middle of the game: Complete strategy shifts after 5-6 rounds\n   - Recent rounds: More responsive but not perfectly adaptive\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they switch to Paper (countering my Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock (complete change): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they continue with Scissors (unlikely): Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors anticipates their most logical move (Paper)\n    - This has lower risk than playing Paper (which loses to Scissors)\n    - The reward is lower (+1 vs +3) but more probable\n\n11. Considering their evolution toward more adaptive play:\n    - They're more likely to counter my last successful move\n    - They've shown they learn from losses\n    - Paper is their most logical next move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll switch to Paper to counter my successful Rock play from the previous round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've played Scissors three consecutive times\n\n3. This is interesting because:\n   - They lost with Scissors in round 19\n   - But continued with Scissors in round 20\n   - This suggests they might be returning to their earlier behavior of sticking with moves\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 18-20: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I've used all three moves in the last three rounds\n\n5. After our tie with mutual Scissors:\n   - Common psychology suggests players often switch after a tie\n   - The natural counter to Scissors is Rock\n   - Many players would expect their opponent to play Rock after a Scissors tie\n\n6. My opponent's strategic evolution:\n   - Early: Long sequences of the same move (particularly Scissors)\n   - Middle: Long sequence of Paper\n   - Recent: More adaptive, but now possibly returning to Scissors persistence\n\n7. Considering their potential approaches:\n   - If they're returning to move persistence: Scissors is likely\n   - If they're being adaptive: Rock is likely (countering expected Scissors)\n   - If they're thinking multiple moves ahead: Paper is possible (countering expected Rock)\n\n8. Looking at their longest patterns:\n   - They played Scissors for 5-6 rounds early in the game\n   - They played Paper for 5 rounds in the middle\n   - They're now on 3 consecutive Scissors\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play Scissors again: Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n\n10. Strategic calculation:\n    - Given their history of move persistence, Scissors remains possible\n    - Given the natural tendency to switch after a tie, Rock is possible\n    - Paper seems least likely as it requires multiple levels of prediction\n\n11. Weighing the evidence:\n    - Their most consistent pattern is sticking with moves for extended sequences\n    - They've now played Scissors three times in a row\n    - The simplest and most aligned prediction is that they may continue with Scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll either continue their Scissors streak (following their pattern of move persistence) or make the most straightforward adaptation by switching to Rock after our tie.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played Scissors FOUR consecutive times\n\n3. This confirms their return to move persistence:\n   - Despite losing twice to my Rock with their Scissors\n   - Despite tying once with Scissors\n   - They've continued to play Scissors regardless of outcome\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 19-21: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - I've won twice with Rock against their Scissors\n\n5. This pattern strongly resembles their earlier behavior:\n   - Early in the game, they played Scissors 5-6 times in a row\n   - They appear to be repeating this pattern now\n   - They're currently on a 4-round Scissors streak\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - Their persistence with Scissors despite repeated losses shows remarkable commitment to their pattern\n   - This suggests they might not be strategizing based on outcomes\n   - They might be following a predetermined sequence or simple algorithm\n\n7. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Scissors (consistent with pattern): Rock wins (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to Rock (to counter my Rock): Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Paper (to counter my expected Rock): Scissors wins (+1)\n\n8. Pattern completion theory:\n   - If they're following their earlier pattern length, they might play Scissors 1-2 more times to complete a 5-6 move sequence\n   - After that, they might switch completely to a different move\n\n9.

I lost -1 point.\n   - Round 19: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 20: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 21: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors. I won +1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. I lost -3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 18-21: Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - Round 22: Paper (significant pattern break)\n\n3. This is an important development:\n   - After 4 consecutive Scissors plays, they switched to Paper\n   - This perfectly countered my Rock play for their biggest win (+3)\n   - They've become more adaptive than I anticipated\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 20-22: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - I repeated Rock and lost badly\n\n5. Their adaptation suggests:\n   - They noticed I was exploiting their Scissors pattern with Rock\n   - They waited until I was confident enough to play Rock twice\n   - Then they countered perfectly with Paper\n\n6. Psychological factors:\n   - After a significant win, they might:\n     a) Continue with Paper after it worked well\n     b) Anticipate I'll switch to Scissors and play Rock\n     c) Return to their Scissors pattern\n\n7. Their overall strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: Predictable patterns of 5-6 same moves\n   - Mid game: Different predictable patterns\n   - Recent rounds: More adaptive and responsive\n\n8. My missed prediction:\n   - I thought they would complete a 5-6 move Scissors sequence\n   - Instead, they adapted after 4 moves\n   - This suggests they're becoming less predictable\n\n9. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper after success: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they anticipate my Scissors and play Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they return to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - After my significant loss (-3), I should be more cautious\n    - Playing Scissors is relatively safe (wins vs Paper, loses only -1 to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper is higher risk (loses -1 to Scissors) but higher reward (+3 vs Rock)\n\n11. Most likely scenarios based on their evolution:\n    - They're becoming more adaptive\n    - They recognize patterns and exploit them\n    - After a big win with Paper, continuing with Paper is reasonable\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll either continue with Paper after their significant success or expect me to overthink and play Paper again. This is the safest counter to their most probable move while limiting potential losses.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I lost -3 points.\n   - Round 23: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper. I won +1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 22-23: Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - After their 4-round Scissors streak, they've played Paper twice in a row\n\n3. Analysis of their recent behavior:\n   - They switched from Scissors to Paper to counter my Rock\n   - They continued with Paper despite losing to my Scissors\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new move sequence with Paper\n\n4. My recent moves:\n   - Rounds 21-23: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - I successfully adapted to their Paper with Scissors\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n   - They've shown a tendency to stick with moves for multiple rounds\n   - Their first pattern: 5-6 rounds of Scissors\n   - Their second pattern: 5 rounds of Paper\n   - Their recent pattern: 4 rounds of Scissors followed by 2 rounds of Paper so far\n\n6. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Paper to my Scissors, they have two likely responses:\n     a) Continue their Paper sequence despite the loss (consistent with earlier behavior)\n     b) Switch to Rock to counter my expected Scissors\n\n7. Their historical adaptability:\n   - They've shown they stick with moves despite losses\n   - They've also shown they can make strategic adaptations\n   - The question is whether they're currently in \"pattern mode\" or \"adaptive mode\"\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they continue with Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n\n9. Weighing probabilities based on their history:\n   - Given their pattern of extended move sequences, Paper is still likely\n   - Given they just lost with Paper, Rock is also plausible\n   - Given their overall play style, Scissors seems less likely\n\n10. Risk/reward assessment:\n    - Playing Scissors again has moderate risk/reward (wins vs Paper, loses to Rock)\n    - Playing Paper has higher risk/reward (wins big vs Rock, loses to Scissors)\n    - Given their historical preference for move persistence, Scissors may be safer\n\n11. Since they've demonstrated move persistence even after losses:\n    - They might continue with Paper despite the loss\n    - This aligns with their behavior in previous sequences\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, anticipating they'll continue with Paper based on their historical pattern of move persistence even after losses.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
