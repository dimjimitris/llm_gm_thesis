My prediction was correct - they played rock after winning with scissors, and my paper won, earning me 3 points.\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Round 2: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n- Round 3: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- Round 4: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Round 5: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- Round 7: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 8: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 9: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- Round 10: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Round 11: I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n- Round 12: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- Round 13: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Round 14: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Round 15: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- Round 17: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Round 18: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- Round 19: I played rock, they played scissors (I won)\n- Round 20: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n- Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- Round 22: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n- Round 23: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n\nLooking at what happens after I win with paper (rounds 5, 14, 17, 20, and now 23):\n- After Round 5: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n- After Round 14: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- After Round 17: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n- After Round 20: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n\nThere's a pattern here: when I win with paper and play scissors next (rounds 6 and 21), I tend to win again because they play paper. When I win with paper and play rock next (rounds 15 and 18), I tend to lose because they play paper.\n\nGiven this pattern and my recent success with scissors after paper wins:\n\n[move] Scissors. After winning with paper and seeing my opponent's consistent pattern of playing paper after I win with paper, I'm choosing scissors which should beat their anticipated paper move.\n",
