They might play paper to counter my expected rock. However, considering their strong tendency to repeat winning moves, they might surprise me and break their own pattern. I'll risk sticking with rock, as it's performed well for me and might catch them off-guard if they're overthinking their strategy.\n",

This pattern is becoming quite reliable.\n\n[move] Paper\nBased on the established pattern, my opponent is likely to play rock again (repeating their most recent move). If they do, my paper will beat it again. If they break pattern and play scissors, I'll lose. However, given their strong tendency to repeat moves throughout our game, sticking with paper is my most strategic choice.\n"
