You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

It has potential to win against scissors (gaining 1 point) while risking a loss against paper (losing 3 points). As we play more rounds, I'll observe patterns and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n",

Paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins, making it a reasonably attractive first move. Many players also tend to choose rock as their first move, which would make paper advantageous.\n\n[move] Paper\n",

The payoff structure is interesting - winning with paper gives 3 points while winning with rock or scissors gives only 1 point. Losing to paper costs 3 points while losing to rock or scissors costs 1 point.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward but also the highest potential risk. Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent, I'll choose a move that balances risk and reward.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

The payoff matrix shows paper has the highest potential reward (+3), making it tempting, but my opponent may anticipate this.\n\nIn the absence of prior information, I'll start with a balanced approach.\n\n[move] Rock\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have previous patterns to analyze.\n\nThe payoff structure is interesting - paper beating rock gives the most points (3), while the other victories only give 1 point. This makes paper slightly more valuable as a winning move, though rock and scissors are less costly when losing.\n\nFor a first move against a new player, I'll choose paper. It offers the highest reward if successful, and people often choose rock as their first move in RPS games.\n\n[move] paper\n"
