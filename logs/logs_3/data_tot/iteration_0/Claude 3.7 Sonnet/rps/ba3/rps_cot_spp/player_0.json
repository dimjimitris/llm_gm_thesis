Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. This is an asymmetric payoff structure - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), but also comes with the highest risk (-3).\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their playing style or patterns.\n\n4. I need to balance risk and reward. Playing paper has the highest potential gain but also the highest potential loss.\n\n5. Rock and scissors both have the same modest risk/reward profile (+1/-1).\n\n6. In the absence of information about the opponent, I'll choose to play paper since it has the highest expected value if moves are played randomly (paper has +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors).\n\n7. The expected value calculation would be:\n   - For paper: (+3)\u00d7(1/3) + (-1)\u00d7(1/3) + (0)\u00d7(1/3) = +2/3\n   - For rock: (-3)\u00d7(1/3) + (0)\u00d7(1/3) + (+1)\u00d7(1/3) = -2/3\n   - For scissors: (+1)\u00d7(1/3) + (-1)\u00d7(1/3) + (0)\u00d7(1/3) = 0\n\n8. Based on this initial expected value analysis, paper is the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's track the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n\n2. My opponent has shown a pattern: paper \u2192 rock. This suggests they might be thinking strategically, anticipating my moves.\n\n3. In Round 2, it appears they correctly predicted I would switch to scissors to counter their paper, so they countered with rock.\n\n4.

Let's analyze the opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: scissors\n\n3. Interestingly, they've cycled through all three options in order: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. \n\n4.

To counter rock, my best move would be paper, which would give me the highest reward (+3 points).\n\n6.

Tracking the opponent's recent moves more carefully:\n   - Original pattern through Round 6: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 7: scissors (deviation from expected paper)\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n\n3. They've now used scissors in Round 7, paper in Round 8, and scissors again in Round 9.\n\n4. This doesn't follow their original pattern, nor does it follow a clear new pattern yet.\n\n5. My current score is +1 point (+1-1+1+1+3+1+0-3-1), so I'm still slightly positive despite recent losses.\n\n6. The opponent seems to have abandoned their predictable pattern and may be playing more strategically or unpredictably.\n\n7. Given that they've played scissors twice in the last three rounds, they might be favoring this move.\n\n8. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play rock to counter their recent scissors, and thus play paper.\n\n9. At this point, with the pattern broken and recent moves showing no clear new pattern, I need to be more cautious and adaptive.\n\n10. Rock would be a safer move now for two reasons:\n    - It counters their most frequently played recent move (scissors)\n    - The risk/reward profile is more balanced (+1/-3) compared to other options\n\n11. Given their recent preference for scissors and the need to stabilize after consecutive losses, I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent continues to show no clear pattern in their recent moves.\n\n5. Given the tie in the last round, we both played rock. There are several possibilities for their next move:\n   - They might stick with rock, thinking it's a safe move\n   - They might play paper to beat my rock if they think I'll repeat it\n   - They might play scissors, anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their rock\n\n6. Since we're at a critical juncture where their strategy isn't clear, I need to consider what move gives me the best risk-reward balance.\n\n7. If I play rock again:\n   - If they play rock: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: I lose (-3 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I win (+1 point)\n\n8. If I play paper:\n   - If they play rock: I win (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n\n9. If I play scissors:\n   - If they play rock: I lose (-1 point)\n   - If they play paper: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n10. After a tie with rock, many players tend to switch to paper to try to beat their opponent's repeated rock.\n\n11.

We've now had two consecutive ties, with both of us playing rock in Round 10 and scissors in Round 11.\n\n5. After consecutive ties, players often try to break the pattern by switching to what would beat their opponent's last move.\n\n6. Since we both played scissors last round, they might expect me to play rock next (to beat their scissors), and thus they might play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n7. Looking at a broader pattern in their recent plays:\n   - They seem to be changing moves frequently\n   - They've played scissors twice in the last three rounds\n   - They haven't played paper since Round 8\n\n8. With scissors being their most recent and most frequent recent move, there's a decent chance they might play it again or switch to rock to counter my potential paper.\n\n9. If I play rock:\n   - Beats their scissors (+1)\n   - Loses to their paper (-3)\n   - Ties with their rock (0)\n\n10.

The opponent seems to have caught me in a pattern of responding predictably to their moves. In particular, they've now played paper successfully against my rock twice (Rounds 8 and 12).\n\n5. There's no clear pattern in their recent plays, suggesting they might be responding adaptively to my moves or using a more complex strategy.\n\n6. After they've successfully played paper against me, I need to be careful about them anticipating my adjustment.\n\n7. They might expect me to play scissors next to counter their paper, and thus they might play rock.\n\n8. Alternatively, they might stick with paper since it worked well, expecting me to play rock again.\n\n9. I need to break out of predictable responses to avoid being exploited.\n\n10.

Critical pattern observation: When I've played rock recently, they've consistently countered with paper (Rounds 8, 12, and 14).\n\n5. They seem to be effectively predicting my moves or have a successful strategy against me:\n   - They counter my rocks with paper\n   - They match my scissors with scissors\n   - The last time I played paper (Round 9), they played scissors\n\n6. They appear to be particularly good at anticipating when I'll play rock.\n\n7. The pattern suggests they might be using a strategy where they:\n   - Track my moves\n   - Play paper whenever they think I'll play rock\n   - Play scissors otherwise\n\n8. At this point, I need to:\n   - Break my own patterns\n   - Stop playing rock temporarily, as they consistently counter it with paper\n   - Find a way to counter their apparent strategy\n\n9. Given their pattern of alternating scissors and paper in the last four rounds, they might play scissors next.\n\n10. However, they've been very successful with paper against my rock, so they might expect me to switch to scissors, and thus play rock themselves.\n\n11. I haven't played paper since Round 9, and they might not expect it now. If they follow the alternating pattern, they'd play scissors, which my paper would lose to.\n\n12. However, if they anticipate I'll avoid rock and play scissors, they might play rock, which paper would beat.\n\n13. Given their success pattern and my need to break the cycle of losses, I'll play paper, hoping to catch them playing rock as they anticipate my scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 13: scissors\n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n\n3. My score is now -7 points after another loss, and I'm on a 4-round losing streak.\n\n4. The opponent has broken their alternating pattern of paper-scissors. They've now played:\n   scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n5. This suggests they might be directly countering my expected moves rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n6. Analyzing the second half of the game (Rounds 9-16):\n   - Every time I've played rock, they've played paper\n   - Every time I've played paper, they've played scissors\n   - When I've played scissors, they've played scissors (ties) or rock (I lose)\n\n7. They seem to be consistently one step ahead of my strategy, suggesting they might be:\n   - Successfully predicting my moves based on patterns\n   - Using a strong counter-strategy against my tendencies\n\n8. At this point, I need to be unpredictable and try to break my losing streak.\n\n9. Given their last move was rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll counter with rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll try paper\n\n10. Since they've consistently beaten my recent moves, I should avoid any obvious counters to their last move.\n\n11. Looking at my move distribution, I've played paper least recently, and they might not expect it after their rock.\n\n12. While paper would lose to scissors (which they might play), it would beat rock if they repeat it, and the +3 potential reward could help recover my score.\n\n13.

Let's update the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 14: paper\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: paper\n\n3. My score remains at -7 points after the tie.\n\n4. The tie breaks my losing streak, though I still haven't won in a long time.\n\n5. After a paper-paper tie, players often try to gain advantage by playing scissors.\n\n6. However, given my opponent's demonstrated ability to anticipate my moves, they might expect me to play scissors and counter with rock.\n\n7. Looking at their recent sequence (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), there's no consistent pattern except perhaps a tendency to use all three moves in varied sequences.\n\n8. In the second half of the game, when I've played the same move as them (resulting in a tie), their next move has varied:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in Round 11, they played paper in Round 12\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in Round 13, they played paper in Round 14\n\n9. Since our last tie was with paper, and based on their previous responses to ties, they might play scissors next.\n\n10. To counter scissors, I would typically play rock. However, they've consistently beaten my rock plays with paper in the latter half of the game.\n\n11. This creates a dilemma: if I expect scissors and play rock, they might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n12. At this point, given their adaptability, I need to break my own patterns.\n\n13. Since we just tied with paper, and they might expect me to play scissors next to counter their expected paper, I'll counter their potential counter by playing rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n\n3. My score remains at -7 points after another tie.\n\n4. We've now had two consecutive ties (paper-paper, rock-rock).\n\n5. After a rock-rock tie, there's often a tendency for players to switch to paper to try to win.\n\n6. However, my opponent has shown they're adept at anticipating conventional responses.\n\n7. Looking at their recent sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they seem to be cycling through different moves but not in a predictable pattern.\n\n8. After our previous ties:\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in Round 7, they played paper in Round 8\n   - After rock-rock tie in Round 10, they played scissors in Round 11\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in Round 13, they played paper in Round 14\n   - After paper-paper tie in Round 17, they played rock in Round 18\n\n9. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after ties, though they've never played the same move immediately after a tie.\n\n10. Given the rock-rock tie just now, and based on their history, they're likely to switch to either paper or scissors.\n\n11. If they follow the pattern of not repeating moves after a tie, they won't play rock again.\n\n12. Between paper and scissors, paper is historically more likely after a tie (they played paper after 2 of our 4 previous ties).\n\n13. If they play paper, my best counter would be scissors.\n\n14. If they play scissors, my best counter would be rock (which I just played).\n\n15. Given the higher probability of them playing paper based on their post-tie history, and my need to score points, I'll play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 16: rock\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n\n3. My score remains at -7 points after yet another tie.\n\n4. We're now on a streak of 3 consecutive ties (paper-paper, rock-rock, scissors-scissors), which is unusual.\n\n5. We've now played all three possible moves in the last three rounds, all resulting in ties. This suggests either:\n   - My opponent is mirroring my moves (though this seems unlikely given the history)\n   - We're both using similar logic to determine our next moves\n   - There's a strange coincidence\n\n6. After our previous scissors-scissors ties:\n   - After Round 7 tie: they played paper in Round 8\n   - After Round 11 tie: they played paper in Round 12\n   - After Round 13 tie: they played paper in Round 14\n\n7. Interestingly, after every scissors-scissors tie in our history, they've played paper in the following round.\n\n8. This is a strong pattern that suggests they might play paper next.\n\n9. If they do play paper as this pattern suggests, my best counter would be scissors again.\n\n10. However, they might be aware of this pattern themselves and deliberately break it, playing rock instead to counter my expected scissors.\n\n11. Given the unusual streak of ties and the need to break the stalemate, I need to make a move that:\n    - Has a good chance of winning\n    - Accounts for their potential awareness of patterns\n\n12. Since their most consistent pattern is playing paper after scissors-scissors ties, and this has happened 3 out of 3 times in our history, I'll counter with scissors again, despite the risk they might anticipate this.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: paper\n\n3. My score is now -6 points after finally breaking my long streak without a win.\n\n4. The strong pattern I identified in my previous analysis proved correct - they played paper after a scissors-scissors tie, as they had done 3 times previously.\n\n5. After winning with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - Switch to rock anticipating they'll switch to scissors\n   - Switch to paper to counter their potential rock\n\n6. Looking at patterns after I've won rounds:\n   - After I won Round 3 with rock, they played paper in Round 4\n   - After I won Round 4 with scissors, they played rock in Round 5\n   - After I won Round 5 with paper, they played scissors in Round 6\n   - After I won Round 6 with rock, they played scissors in Round 7\n\n7. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after I win a round.\n\n8. However, now that I've broken their pattern recognition (if that's what they were using), they might adjust their strategy.\n\n9. Given that they just lost with paper, they're unlikely to play paper again immediately.\n\n10. Between rock and scissors, rock would be the safer choice for them against my potential scissors or paper.\n\n11. If they play rock next, my best counter would be paper.\n\n12. If they play scissors next, my best counter would be rock.\n\n13. Considering the payoff structure and my current score, the paper-against-rock scenario (+3 points) would be more beneficial for me than rock-against-scissors (+1 point).\n\n14. Given that they just lost with paper and are unlikely to repeat it, and the higher potential reward from playing paper, I'll play paper expecting them to switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They've repeated paper, which is unusual given their generally varied play throughout the game.\n\n7. After a paper-paper tie, their historical responses have been:\n   - After Round 1 tie: they played rock in Round 2\n   - After Round 17 tie: they played rock in Round 18\n\n8. Both times after a paper-paper tie, they played rock in the next round.\n\n9. This suggests they might play rock again following this paper-paper tie.\n\n10. However, they might also be aware that I could identify this pattern and anticipate them playing rock, so they might play something else.\n\n11. If they play rock as the pattern suggests, my best counter would be paper again.\n\n12. If they anticipate me playing paper and play scissors instead, I would lose.\n\n13. If they play paper again (though less likely), scissors would win.\n\n14.

The pattern I identified (rock after paper-paper tie) proved correct again, and I successfully capitalized on it.\n\n5. I've now won two of the last three rounds, breaking my previous losing streak.\n\n6. Looking at their response after I win with paper against their rock:\n   - After I won Round 5 with paper against rock, they played scissors in Round 6\n   - Now I've won Round 22 with paper against rock\n\n7. Based on this limited pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\n8. Looking more broadly at their responses after I win:\n   - After I won Round 3, they played paper in Round 4\n   - After I won Round 4, they played rock in Round 5\n   - After I won Round 5, they played scissors in Round 6\n   - After I won Round 6, they played scissors in Round 7\n   - After I won Round 20, they played paper in Round 21\n\n9. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after I win, except that they played scissors after my paper-beats-rock win in Round 5.\n\n10. Given my recent success and improving score, they might be more likely to change their strategy or try to counter what they think I'll do next.\n\n11. After winning with paper, there's a psychological tendency to stick with what worked or to anticipate the opponent will counter your last successful move.\n\n12. If they expect me to play paper again, they might play scissors.\n\n13. If they play scissors as suggested by the limited pattern from Round 5-6, my best counter would be rock.\n\n14.

My score is now -2 points after another win, my third win in the last four rounds.\n\n4. I've successfully identified a pattern and capitalized on it:\n   - They played rock after our paper-paper tie as expected\n   - They played scissors after I won with paper against rock, as they did previously\n\n5. I'm now on a winning streak of 3 consecutive wins:\n   - Round 20: scissors vs paper (+1)\n   - Round 22: paper vs rock (+3)\n   - Round 23: rock vs scissors (+1)\n\n6. Looking at their response after I win with rock against scissors:\n   - After I won Round 3 with rock against scissors, they played paper in Round 4\n   - After I won Round 6 with rock against scissors, they played scissors in Round 7\n   - Now I've won Round 23 with rock against scissors\n\n7. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after I win with rock against scissors.\n\n8. Looking at their general responses when I win consecutive rounds:\n   - After I won Rounds 3-4-5-6 (my previous winning streak), they played scissors in Round 7\n   - Now I've won Rounds 20-22-23\n\n9. Given my winning streak, they might be frustrated and change their strategy more drastically.\n\n10. After losing with scissors, they might:\n    - Switch to rock to counter my potential rock repeat\n    - Switch to paper to counter my potential switch to scissors\n    - Stick with scissors hoping I'll switch to paper\n\n11. Given that they've lost three of the last four rounds, they're likely to adapt their strategy.\n\n12. The safest move for them would be to play paper, which would:\n    - Beat my rock if I repeat it\n    - Lose to scissors if I switch\n    - Tie with paper if I switch to that\n\n13. Considering their previous adaptations and the psychological tendency to counter after losses, I predict they'll play paper.\n\n14. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
