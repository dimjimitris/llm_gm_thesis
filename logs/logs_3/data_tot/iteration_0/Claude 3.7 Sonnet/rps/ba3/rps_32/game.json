First, I need to understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with no points\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors psychology, many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if it wins against rock.\n\n5. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses rock, I gain 3 points. If they choose scissors, I lose only 1 point. If they choose paper too, it's a tie.\n\n6. The expected value analysis suggests paper is a good strategic first move due to the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] paper\n"

A common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is for players to rotate through options. Since they played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n5. Given that paper beats rock for the highest potential gain (3 points), I could choose paper again. However, this seems risky as they just used scissors.\n\n6.

So far, my opponent has played scissors in round 1 and paper in round 2.\n\n2. I've now lost with both paper and rock, scoring -1 and -3 points respectively.\n\n3. Analyzing the pattern: my opponent seems to be making optimal counter-moves to my choices. This could be coincidence, or they might be strategically anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at their sequence so far (scissors \u2192 paper), there's a possibility they're following a pattern. In classic rock-paper-scissors strategy, a common pattern is to play what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, they might play rock next (as rock would beat their previous scissors move).\n\n6. If they play rock, my best response would be paper (gaining 3 points).\n\n7. However, they might also be employing reverse psychology, expecting me to choose paper after they played paper, in which case they would choose scissors again.\n\n8. The payoff matrix is asymmetric: paper winning against rock gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning scenarios only award 1 point.\n\n9. Given my current negative score (-4 points total), I need to prioritize a high potential gain, but I also need to be cautious about further losses.\n\n10. Since scissors has not been played by me yet, and would counter their paper if they repeat it, this seems like a reasonable choice with moderate risk and potential reward.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Notably, my opponent has beaten me every time, suggesting they might be predicting my moves or using a specific strategy.\n\n4. Their sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) follows the pattern of standard rock-paper-scissors rotation. If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n5.

I won the last round by playing rock against their scissors, gaining 1 point. My total is now -2 points.\n\n4. The most striking pattern is that my opponent has now played scissors four consecutive times, which is extremely unusual in standard rock-paper-scissors strategy.\n\n5. This persistent repetition suggests:\n   - They might be employing a deliberate strategy of extended repetition\n   - They could be testing how I respond to repetition\n   - They might continue with scissors yet again, betting I'll think \"surely they won't play scissors five times in a row\"\n\n6. Their strategy has become somewhat predictable, but precisely because it's so unusual, it creates doubt.\n\n7. If they continue with scissors for a fifth time, rock would win again (+1 point).\n\n8. However, they might finally break the pattern after losing and switch to paper (to beat my expected rock) or rock (to tie if I play rock again).\n\n9. The question becomes: how committed are they to this scissors strategy, and how likely are they to adapt after losing?\n\n10. Most rational players would change strategies after losing with the same move four times in a row.\n\n11. If they expect me to play rock again (the rational counter to their scissors streak), they would likely play paper.\n\n12. In that case, scissors would be my optimal counter, giving me another win (+1 point).\n\n13. Given the psychological dynamics at play and the high probability they'll finally switch strategies after losing, scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We just tied with scissors. My total remains at -2 points.\n\n4. My opponent has now played scissors FIVE times in a row, which is extraordinary in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n5. This extreme repetition suggests:\n   - They might be employing a deliberate strategy of extended repetition until it fails\n   - They could be using a psychological strategy, attempting to make me doubt myself\n   - They might be playing completely randomly and coincidentally repeating scissors\n\n6. After I switched to scissors (expecting them to switch to paper), they still played scissors, leading to a tie.\n\n7. The question remains: will they continue this unusual scissors streak, or will they finally change?\n\n8. If they continue with scissors for a sixth time, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n9. However, after five consecutive scissors moves, they might finally switch:\n   - To paper (anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors streak)\n   - To rock (trying to beat my potential scissors play)\n\n10. The probability of them continuing scissors for a sixth time seems lower than them finally switching, but their extreme commitment to this strategy so far makes it difficult to predict.\n\n11. Rock is the safest play against their potential continued scissors streak and would tie with rock if they switch to that.\n\n12. However, if they switch to paper (which is a logical counter if they expect me to play rock), I would lose 3 points.\n\n13.

I won the last round by playing rock against their scissors, gaining 1 point. My total is now -1 points.\n\n4. My opponent has now played scissors SIX times in a row, which is extremely unusual and defies conventional strategy.\n\n5.

Last round, I correctly played rock against their scissors and won.\n\n7. The key question: After losing twice to rock, will they finally abandon the scissors strategy?\n\n8. If they continue with scissors for a seventh time, playing rock would win again (+1 point).\n\n9. However, after losing twice with the same move, most players would switch:\n   - To paper (to beat the rock that defeated them)\n   - To rock (to at least tie if I play rock again)\n\n10.

I lost the last round by playing scissors against their rock, losing 1 point. My total is back to -2 points.\n\n4. After six consecutive scissors moves, they finally switched to rock.\n\n5.

They've demonstrated two behavioral patterns so far:\n   - Extended repetition of the same move (particularly scissors)\n   - Occasional strategic switches to counter my anticipated moves\n\n7. Given that they just successfully switched strategies and won 3 points, they might be emboldened to continue adapting rather than returning to repetition.\n\n8. If they continue with paper, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n9. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n10. If they switch to rock, paper would win (+3 points).\n\n11. Considering their recent success with adaptation and the psychological dynamics at play, scissors seems like the most strategic choice, anticipating they'll continue with paper or at least expecting me to adjust to paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

We just tied with scissors. My total remains at -4 points.\n\n4. Their pattern has taken another interesting turn:\n   - After breaking their scissors streak with paper (which beat my rock)\n   - They've now returned to scissors\n\n5. This suggests:\n   - They might be returning to their scissors repetition strategy\n   - They could be alternating between scissors and paper\n   - They might be trying to establish a new, less predictable pattern\n\n6. If they're returning to their scissors repetition, they might play scissors again.\n\n7. If they're alternating between scissors and paper, they would play paper next.\n\n8. If they're trying to be less predictable, they might play rock to complete a rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n9. Given their history of extended scissors repetition and their recent return to scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n10. If they play scissors again, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n12. If they switch to rock, paper would win (+3 points).\n\n13.

I lost the last round by playing rock against their paper, losing 3 more points. My total is now -7 points.\n\n4. A clearer pattern is emerging in their recent moves:\n   - After their scissors streak, they've played paper twice when I played rock\n   - They seem to be effectively countering my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - They might be successfully predicting my strategy\n\n5. Their last two paper plays suggest:\n   - They're anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n   - They're adapting strategically rather than repeating moves blindly\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock given my previous success with it\n\n6. After winning with paper against my rock twice, they might:\n   - Play paper again, expecting me to stubbornly stick with rock\n   - Switch to scissors, anticipating I'll switch to paper to counter their paper\n   - Switch to rock to counter my potential scissors play\n\n7. Given their recent adaptive strategy and success with paper, scissors seems like the most logical counter to their expected paper play.\n\n8. If they play paper again, scissors would win (+1 point).\n\n9. If they switch to scissors (anticipating my paper), I would tie with scissors (0 points).\n\n10. If they switch to rock (anticipating my scissors), I would lose (-1 point).\n\n11. Considering their recent pattern of successfully countering my moves and my significant negative score, scissors offers the best chance to win points while limiting potential losses.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I won the last round by playing scissors against their paper, gaining 1 point. My total is now -6 points.\n\n4. Their recent pattern shows:\n   - They played paper three times in a row\n   - They seem to have switched from their scissors repetition strategy to a paper repetition strategy\n   - This could be another extended repetition pattern like their earlier scissors streak\n\n5. After losing to my scissors with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (maintaining their new repetition pattern)\n   - Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors play)\n   - Return to scissors (to mix up their strategy)\n\n6. Given their demonstrated tendency for extended repetition (previously with scissors), there's a possibility they'll continue with paper despite just losing with it.\n\n7. However, a rational player would likely switch to rock after losing with paper against scissors.\n\n8. If they continue with paper, scissors would win again (+1 point).\n\n9. If they switch to rock, paper would win (+3 points).\n\n10. If they switch to scissors, rock would win (+1 point).\n\n11. Considering their historical pattern of extended repetition, but also accounting for rational adaptation after losing, there's a higher probability they'll switch to rock to counter my scissors.\n\n12.

First, I should consider the payoff matrix for this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same move results in a tie: 0 points for both\n\n2. This is different from standard rock-paper-scissors because the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (\u00b13) than the other victories (\u00b11).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, there's no pattern to analyze yet.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, I should lean toward playing paper since:\n   - If I win with paper (against rock), I get +3 points\n   - If I lose with paper (against scissors), I only lose -1 point\n   - This gives paper the highest expected value if all three moves are equally likely\n\n5. However, a rational opponent might also recognize this and be more likely to play scissors to counter paper.\n\n6. For this first move, with no prior information, I'll choose paper for its higher potential reward.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n",

I notice that paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3), but also the highest penalty if I lose (-3).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a new opponent, I have no information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n4. In the absence of information, I should consider what most players tend to choose in the first round:\n   - Rock is often a common first move as it feels \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n   - Some strategic players might anticipate this and choose paper\n\n5. The risk/reward analysis:\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3\n   - If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1\n   - If I choose rock or scissors, the maximum I can win is +1\n\n6. Given the higher potential reward with paper, and that many players start with rock, paper seems to be the optimal first move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I'll think through this step by step to make the best move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's analyze the payoff structure.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history of moves, I don't have information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. In the absence of prior information, I should consider what a typical first-time player might choose. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\n4. If I predict they'll choose rock, my optimal move would be paper, which would give me 3 points.\n\n5. However, if they anticipate this reasoning, they might choose scissors to counter my paper.\n\n6. Given these considerations, I should weigh the higher reward potential of paper against the balanced option of rock.\n\n7. Paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if I'm correct, while the potential loss (-1) is less severe than rock's potential loss (-3).\n\n8. This makes paper a reasonable strategic choice for the first move, balancing reward potential against risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] paper\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I don't have information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n3. In standard rock-paper-scissors psychology, many players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n4.

If they stick with scissors (which worked for them before), my best counter would be rock.\n\n4. If they anticipate me switching to rock and choose paper, I would lose 3 points by choosing rock.\n\n5.

Let me analyze what this might tell me about my opponent:\n   - They either predicted I would choose paper\n   - Or they simply prefer scissors as an opening move\n   - Or they randomly selected scissors\n\n3. Understanding the psychology of rock-paper-scissors, players often shift their strategy after a win. My opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors since it worked (stick with winning move)\n   - Anticipate that I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors, so they might switch to paper\n   - Make a completely different choice thinking I'll overthink\n\n4.

Looking at the payoff structure again:\n   - If I choose rock and they repeat scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I choose rock and they switch to paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I choose rock and they switch to rock, it's a tie\n\n4. A common pattern in rock-paper-scissors is for players to rotate through options. Since they played scissors, they might play rock next.\n\n5.

This could be coincidence, or they might be strategically anticipating my moves.\n\n4. Looking at their sequence so far (scissors \u2192 paper), there's a possibility they're following a pattern. In classic rock-paper-scissors strategy, a common pattern is to play what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n5.

Breaking out of this cycle requires making a move that counters their most likely next move.\n\n11.

If they continue with scissors for a fifth time, rock would win again (+1 point).\n\n7. However, after losing to rock, they're highly likely to switch strategies:\n   - They might play paper to beat my expected rock repeat\n   - They might play rock themselves, anticipating I'll switch to scissors\n   - They might return to scissors if they think I'll overthink and play paper\n\n8. Most strategic RPS players would switch after losing with the same move repeatedly.\n\n9. Given that I just won with rock, they likely expect me to play rock again. Their optimal counter would be paper.\n\n10. To counter their expected paper play, scissors would be my best move.\n\n11. This creates a typical double-think scenario in RPS - if they think I'll switch to scissors anticipating their paper, they might play rock.\n\n12.

This extraordinary commitment to one move suggests:\n   - They might be following a very specific strategy that involves extended repetition\n   - They could be testing how long it takes me to consistently counter their move\n   - They might be trying to condition me to expect scissors, before suddenly changing\n\n6. Last round, I correctly played rock against their scissors and won.\n\n7. The key question: After losing twice to rock, will they finally abandon the scissors strategy?\n\n8. If they continue with scissors for a seventh time, playing rock would win again (+1 point).\n\n9. However, after losing twice with the same move, most players would switch:\n   - To paper (to beat the rock that defeated them)\n   - To rock (to at least tie if I play rock again)\n\n10. The most rational move for them would be to switch to paper, expecting me to play rock again.\n\n11. If they switch to paper, scissors would be my optimal counter (+1 point).\n\n12. Given their unusual behavior so far and the fact they've lost twice with scissors against my rock, the probability of them switching seems higher now than before.\n\n13.

Their recent pattern shows:\n   - They played paper three times in a row\n   - They seem to have switched from their scissors repetition strategy to a paper repetition strategy\n   - This could be another extended repetition pattern like their earlier scissors streak\n\n5. After losing to my scissors with paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper (maintaining their new repetition pattern)\n   - Switch to rock (to beat my expected scissors play)\n   - Return to scissors (to mix up their strategy)\n\n6. Given their demonstrated tendency for extended repetition (previously with scissors), there's a possibility they'll continue with paper despite just losing with it.\n\n7.
