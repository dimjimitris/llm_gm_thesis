Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. I notice the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beating rock has the highest reward/penalty (3 points)\n   - The other matchups only have 1 point at stake\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric payoffs, playing paper is potentially most profitable (3 points if I win), but also riskiest (lose 1 point if countered with scissors).\n\n5. Rock is a balanced choice - potential to lose 3 points against paper, but could gain 1 against scissors.\n\n6. Many players tend to choose rock in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, so playing paper could be advantageous.\n\n7. Since paper has the highest potential reward and counters what many players instinctively choose first, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The payoff structure remains asymmetric:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Rock beating scissors or scissors beating paper only gives 1 point\n\n4. After a tie, many players tend to change their move, expecting their opponent to stay the same or predicting their next move.\n\n5. If the other player anticipates me staying with paper, they would likely switch to scissors to win.\n\n6. To counter this, I should choose rock, which would beat their scissors (gaining 1 point).\n\n7. If they instead switch to rock (expecting me to choose scissors), my rock would result in a tie.\n\n8. The risk of playing rock is losing 3 points if they play paper.\n\n9. However, given the common psychology of changing moves after a tie, and the likelihood they'll try to counter my previous paper play, rock seems like the strategic choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Interesting pattern: In the first two rounds, the opponent matched my moves exactly, leading to ties. In the third round, they played paper while I played scissors, breaking the pattern.\n\n3. This suggests a couple of possibilities:\n   - The opponent was matching my moves in the first two rounds by coincidence\n   - The opponent was copying my moves initially but failed to anticipate my third move\n   - The opponent has a preference for paper (played it twice out of three rounds)\n\n4. If the opponent was truly copying my moves and simply couldn't see my third move before making theirs, they might now switch to copying my previous move (scissors).\n\n5. If the opponent has a preference for paper, they might return to playing paper.\n\n6. If the opponent is strategic, they might play rock to beat my potential scissors play (if they think I'll repeat my winning move).\n\n7. The highest value play remains paper beating rock (3 points), but that's risky if they anticipate it.\n\n8. Since I just won with scissors, many players would expect me to play scissors again (a common tendency to repeat winning moves). The counter to scissors is rock.\n\n9. To counter their potential rock play, I should play paper, which would win me 3 points.\n\n10.

Analyzing the non-matching rounds:\n   - Round 3: I won with scissors against their paper\n   - Round 4: I lost with paper against their scissors\n   - Round 5: I won with scissors against their paper\n   - Round 10: I lost with scissors against their rock\n\n5. This suggests:\n   - When I play scissors, they sometimes play paper (I win) and sometimes rock (I lose)\n   - When I play paper, they sometimes play scissors (I lose)\n   - There's no clear pattern to when they match versus when they don't\n\n6. Given this uncertainty, I should choose the move that:\n   - Has worked well for me historically (scissors won me 2 rounds)\n   - Offers protection against their potential counter-strategy\n\n7. Since they just countered my scissors with rock, they might expect me to avoid scissors this round.\n\n8. I'll play paper, which would:\n   - Beat rock if they repeat their last move\n   - Tie if they match me\n   - Lose to scissors if they anticipate my adjustment\n\n9. Paper offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if they play rock again.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The predominant pattern is still the opponent matching my moves (8/11 = ~73% of the time).\n\n4. Looking at non-matching rounds:\n   - When I play scissors: twice they played paper (I won), once they played rock (I lost)\n   - When I play paper: once they played scissors (I lost)\n   - When I play rock: they've always matched it (ties)\n\n5. Interestingly, rock has always resulted in a tie, giving it a \"safe\" quality.\n\n6. Scissors has been my most successful move (net +1 point), but it also led to a recent loss.\n\n7. Given these observations, I'll play rock:\n   - It has historically always led to ties\n   - If they break pattern and play paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If they break pattern and play scissors, I win 1 point\n\n8. While rock hasn't won me any points yet, it's been consistently safe, and there's a chance the opponent might deviate as they've done in other rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's analyze my options:\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Rock: Ties with rock (0) but loses to paper (-3)\n   - Scissors: Loses to rock (-1) but beats paper (+1)\n\n8. The opponent's recent rock plays suggest they might continue this trend, expecting me to avoid scissors after my loss.\n\n9. Despite the risks, I'll play paper:\n   - This directly counters their recent rock tendency\n   - If they continue with rock: I win +3 points\n   - If they anticipate paper and play scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If they play paper: tie (0 points)\n\n10. The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1) if I'm correct about their rock tendency.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated statistics:\n   - 9 out of 19 rounds have resulted in ties (~47%)\n   - I've won 4 rounds\n   - I've lost 7 rounds (3 in a row now)\n   - My current score is -3 points\n\n3. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has been consistently and successfully countering my moves\n   - They've played rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors in the last three rounds\n   - Their strategy seems to be anticipating my adaptations effectively\n\n4. The opponent appears to be:\n   - Successfully modeling my decision-making process\n   - Predicting that I'll counter their previous move\n   - Staying one step ahead in the prediction chain\n\n5. I need to break this cycle. Instead of trying to counter their last move, I should:\n   - Introduce true randomness or\n   - Return to a move that worked earlier or\n   - Make a move they wouldn't expect based on recent history\n\n6. Given the opponent just played scissors, they might expect me to play rock to counter.\n   - If I play rock and they anticipate it with paper: I lose -3 points\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock again: I lose -1 point\n\n7. Their recent sequence (rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) might indicate a pattern. If they follow with paper, then rock would be my best counter.\n\n8. But given their success at prediction, they might double-anticipate this.\n\n9. I'll play scissors:\n   - This breaks the expected counter-cycle to their scissors\n   - If they play paper expecting me to play rock: I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock expecting me to play scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n\n10. This move introduces unpredictability and breaks the logical progression they might be expecting.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - I just broke a losing streak with a successful prediction\n   - The opponent's last four moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - No clear pattern, but they seem to switch moves frequently\n\n4.

After I win with scissors, the opponent's next moves have been:\n   - After round 3 win: they played scissors (round 4)\n   - After round 5 win: they played rock (round 6)\n   - After round 13 win: they played rock (round 14)\n   - Current situation: what will they play after round 20?\n\n6. Their most common response to my scissors win has been rock (2 out of 3 times).\n\n7. Given this pattern and the fact that they just lost to my scissors, they're likely to play rock next to counter repeated scissors.\n\n8. To counter their anticipated rock, I should play paper:\n   - If they play rock as predicted: I win +3 points\n   - If they play scissors expecting my paper: I lose -1 point\n   - If they play paper: tie (0 points)\n\n9.

Recent sequence:\n   - After my paper loss in round 21, I played rock in round 22 (tie)\n   - The opponent has switched from scissors to rock\n\n6. If the opponent is returning to a matching strategy, they might play whatever I play next.\n\n7. If they're continuing their adaptive countering, after a tie with rock, they might:\n   - Play paper to beat rock if they think I'll repeat\n   - Play scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - Play rock again if they think I'll play scissors\n\n8. Given that scissors has been my most successful move overall (4 wins), and the opponent has frequently played paper against my scissors, I'll play scissors:\n   - If they play paper: I win +1 point\n   - If they play rock: I lose -1 point\n   - If they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\n9.
