The game history now shows a very clear pattern from my opponent:\n1) They've played scissors three times in a row now (after previously playing rock twice in a row)\n2) They tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds, even after losing\n3) They appear to be using some form of cyclical or pattern-based strategy rather than purely reacting to my previous move\n\nBy playing rock again, I'm:\n- Maintaining the strategy that has won me points in the last two rounds\n- Directly countering scissors if they continue their current pattern\n- Taking a calculated risk that they might finally switch to paper\n\nGiven their demonstrated tendency to repeat moves multiple times (even after losing), the probability they'll play scissors again seems higher than random chance. While they might finally switch to paper to counter my rock, their established behavioral pattern suggests another round of scissors is quite plausible. The asymmetric scoring system (gaining 1 point if they play scissors versus losing 3 points if they play paper) makes this a reasonable gamble given their observed pattern of repetition.\n"
