Since this pattern has been so consistent and predictable, the optimal counter-strategy remains playing rock.

The game history now shows a very clear pattern from my opponent:\n1) They've played scissors three times in a row now (after previously playing rock twice in a row)\n2) They tend to stick with moves for multiple rounds, even after losing\n3) They appear to be using some form of cyclical or pattern-based strategy rather than purely reacting to my previous move\n\nBy playing rock again, I'm:\n- Maintaining the strategy that has won me points in the last two rounds\n- Directly countering scissors if they continue their current pattern\n- Taking a calculated risk that they might finally switch to paper\n\nGiven their demonstrated tendency to repeat moves multiple times (even after losing), the probability they'll play scissors again seems higher than random chance. While they might finally switch to paper to counter my rock, their established behavioral pattern suggests another round of scissors is quite plausible. The asymmetric scoring system (gaining 1 point if they play scissors versus losing 3 points if they play paper) makes this a reasonable gamble given their observed pattern of repetition.\n"

        "Another tie - we both played paper this time, showing further evolution in the game dynamics.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm switching to scissors for this round. The pattern of play has become increasingly complex as the game progresses:\n\n1) My opponent has moved away from their initial scissors-heavy strategy\n2) They've now played rock twice followed by paper, showing more variety\n3) They appear to be either mirroring my moves or thinking along similar strategic lines\n\nBy playing scissors, I'm:\n- Directly countering paper if they repeat their most recent move (which fits with their tendency to repeat moves)\n- Positioning to win if they continue their apparent trend of matching my previous move\n- Taking a calculated risk against a switch to rock\n\nGiven that they just played paper, and they've shown tendencies to repeat moves across multiple rounds, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again. Additionally, if they're employing a strategy that attempts to match or predict my moves, scissors provides a potential advantage against paper while accepting the risk against rock. The moderate reward of scissors beating paper (1 point) balanced against the moderate penalty (-1) for losing to rock makes this a balanced strategic choice at this point in our evolving game.\n"

Analyzing the game patterns reveals:\n\n1) My opponent is showing increasing adaptation and responsiveness\n2) They've played rock multiple times recently (3 of the last 4 rounds)\n3) They seem to be anticipating my moves with greater accuracy\n\nBy playing paper, I'm:\n- Directly countering rock, which has been their most frequent recent choice\n- Positioning for the highest possible reward (3 points) if they play rock again\n- Taking a calculated risk against a switch to scissors\n\nTheir recent tendency to play rock suggests it might be their current preferred move, having shifted away from their earlier scissors-heavy strategy. While they might anticipate my switch to paper and counter with scissors, the higher reward potential of paper beating rock (3 points) makes this a strategically sound choice given their recent move history. Additionally, after winning with rock, they might be inclined to stay with it following their observed pattern of sometimes repeating successful moves.\n",

Looking at the full game history, I notice some evolving patterns:\n\n1) My opponent has become increasingly adaptive and less predictable\n2) They've played rock multiple times recently after initially favoring scissors\n3) They seem to be effectively countering my moves, suggesting they might be analyzing my patterns\n\nBy playing paper, I'm:\n- Directly countering rock if they repeat their successful last move (which fits with their occasional tendency to repeat winning moves)\n- Positioning for the highest possible reward (3 points) if they do stick with rock\n- Taking a calculated risk against a return to scissors\n\nGiven that they just won with rock, there's a reasonable probability they'll play rock again based on their demonstrated behavior throughout our match. While they might anticipate my switch to paper and counter with scissors, their recent gameplay shows more rock plays than earlier in our match.

        "My opponent countered my scissors with rock, suggesting they're becoming quite adaptive in their play.\n\n[move] paper\n\nI'm switching to paper for this round.

The higher reward potential of paper beating rock (3 points) makes this worth the risk of losing to scissors (-1 point).
