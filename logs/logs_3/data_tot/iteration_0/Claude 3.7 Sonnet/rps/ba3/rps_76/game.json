First, I should consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against rock.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\n5. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain).\n\n6. If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n7. If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n8. The expected value of choosing paper seems best, given the higher reward potential and the common tendency for first-time players to select rock.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Now I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy:\n   - They just lost using rock, so they might avoid playing rock again\n   - A common response after losing to paper is to switch to scissors (which beats paper)\n   - Players often adjust their strategy based on previous losses\n\n3. If my opponent is thinking strategically, they're likely to play scissors this round to counter my previous paper play.\n\n4. To counter their potential scissors play, my best move would be rock.\n\n5.

If they play Rock again, I gain the maximum possible points (+3). If they play Scissors, I only lose 1 point. This is a calculated risk based on the pattern disruption.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their pattern continues to be reactive to outcomes:\n   - After I won in Round 20, they played Scissors in Round 21 (trying to counter my expected Paper)\n   - This confirms my hypothesis that they're trying to counter what they expect me to play based on what worked for me previously\n\n4. Since I just won in Round 21 with Rock:\n   - They will expect me to play Rock again (since it worked)\n   - They would then play Paper to counter my expected Rock\n\n5. To counter their anticipated Paper, I should play Scissors.\n\n6. If I play Scissors:\n   - If they play Paper (countering my expected Rock), I win 1 point\n   - If they play Rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If they play Scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given their established pattern of trying to counter what worked for me in the previous round, Scissors is the most strategic choice.\n\n8. I've now won the last two rounds by correctly anticipating their counter-strategy, so continuing this approach is logical.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors this round, anticipating they will play paper to counter what they expect me to play (rock again).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n3. After further analysis, their pattern appears more complex than I initially thought:\n   - After they lost in Round 20, they played Scissors in Round 21 (trying to counter what they thought I'd play)\n   - After they lost in Round 21, they played Rock in Round 22 (which did counter my Scissors)\n\n4. It seems they might be:\n   - Trying to directly counter my previous move rather than predicting my next move\n   - Alternating between Rock and other moves (Rock appears frequently)\n   - Adapting their strategy more dynamically than I expected\n\n5. Since I just lost with Scissors against their Rock:\n   - If they're countering my previous move, they would play Paper (to beat my Scissors)\n   - If they're continuing their tendency to favor Rock, they might play Rock again\n   - If they're using a more complex pattern, it's harder to predict\n\n6. Given that they just won with Rock, they might stick with it (a common strategy is to repeat winning moves).\n\n7. If I expect them to play Rock again or Paper:\n   - Paper would beat Rock and tie with Paper\n   - Paper provides the best expected outcome\n\n8. If I play Paper:\n   - If they play Rock again, I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Scissors, I lose 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round, anticipating they might play rock again (repeating their winning move) or possibly paper (countering my previous scissors).\n\n[move] paper\n"

I notice paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against rock, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to rock.\n\n3. Rock and scissors have more balanced outcomes (+1/-1).\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, there's no pattern to exploit.\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper has the highest potential gain but also highest risk\n   - Rock and scissors have equal expected value in a purely random situation\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games\n\n6.

Notice the asymmetric rewards - paper beating rock gives the highest payoff (+3), while the other wins only give +1.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any historical data to analyze patterns.\n\n4. In the absence of prior information, I should consider what a typical player might choose first:\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors\n   - If they choose rock, my best response would be paper (gaining +3)\n   - The downside of paper is relatively small (-1 if they choose scissors)\n\n5. Comparing expected values:\n   - If I play rock: +1 against scissors, -3 against paper, 0 against rock\n   - If I play paper: +3 against rock, -1 against scissors, 0 against paper\n   - If I play scissors: +1 against paper, -1 against rock, 0 against scissors\n\n6.

Looking at the payoff matrix, I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against rock.\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"safe.\"\n\n5. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3 points (highest possible gain).\n\n6. If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n7. If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n8. The expected value of choosing paper seems best, given the higher reward potential and the common tendency for first-time players to select rock.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they expect me to play rock, they might play paper to counter it.\n\n7. To counter their potential paper play, I should play scissors.\n\n8. However, there's also a chance they'll continue with scissors, expecting me to play paper again (since I just lost to scissors with paper).\n\n9. Given the uncertainty in predicting their strategy shift, I need to break any patterns I might have established while also accounting for their possible adjustments.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock in this round. This counters scissors (which they just played) and breaks any predictable pattern I might have established.\n\n[move] rock\n",

Instead of playing rock as the pattern suggested, they played scissors.\n\n4. This could mean:\n   - They anticipated that I would recognize their pattern\n   - They're adapting to counter my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - They might have realized I was countering their moves successfully\n\n5. Since they just played scissors and won, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors again since it worked\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to paper thinking I might play rock to counter their scissors\n\n6. The most strategic approach would be to play rock:\n   - If they repeat scissors (which they might since it just won), I would win 1 point\n   - If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I would lose 3 points\n   - If they switch to rock, it would be a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given that they've shown adaptability by breaking their pattern, playing rock seems to be the best balance of risk and reward, especially since they played scissors twice in a row already.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This could indicate they're repeating a pattern but shifted by one round.\n\n4. If this pattern continues, their next move would be scissors again (following their Round 3 \u2192 4 transition).\n\n5. Another possibility is that they've identified a more complex strategy to counter me. After I lost in Round 4, I played rock (a common response after losing to scissors). They countered perfectly with paper.\n\n6. They may be predicting that after losing to paper with rock, I might play scissors now (to counter their paper).\n\n7. If they anticipate scissors from me, they would play rock to counter.\n\n8. This is getting into multiple levels of prediction and counter-prediction, which makes it difficult to be certain.\n\n9. Since I've lost severely in the last round (-3 points), I need to avoid another big loss, which would happen if I play rock against their paper again.\n\n10. Given the possibility they're repeating their earlier pattern, and my analysis of the potential mind games, I believe scissors is my best move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors.

My previous analysis appears correct: my opponent seems to be consistently playing what would beat their own previous move:\n   - After Rock, they played Scissors (which beats their previous Rock)\n   - After Scissors, they played Paper (which beats their previous Scissors)\n   - After Paper, they played Scissors (which beats their previous Paper)\n   - After Scissors, they played Paper (which beats their previous Scissors) \n   - After Paper, they played Rock (which beats their previous Paper)\n   - After Rock, they played Scissors (which beats their previous Rock)\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, after playing Scissors, they should play Paper next (because Paper beats their previous Scissors move).\n\n5. To counter their expected Paper play, I should play Scissors.\n\n6. Let's check if this reasoning works with the last round:\n   - I correctly predicted they would play Scissors based on their pattern\n   - I successfully countered with Rock and won\n\n7. This gives me confidence that my analysis of their pattern is accurate, and I should continue using it to predict their moves.\n\n8. However, I should remain cautious as they might:\n   - Realize I've figured out their pattern and change it\n   - Have been using a different pattern that coincidentally matched my prediction\n\nFinal decision: Based on the identified pattern where they play what would beat their previous move, I will play scissors this round to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

Following this pattern, after playing Scissors in the last round, they should play Paper next (as Paper beats Scissors).\n\n5. To counter their expected Paper play, I should play Scissors.\n\n6. Let me double-check this hypothesis by reviewing more of their pattern:\n   - Round 4: They played Scissors after Paper in round 3 \u2713\n   - Round 5: They played Paper after Scissors in round 4 \u2713\n   - Round 6: They played Rock after Paper in round 5 \u2713\n   - Round 7: They played Scissors after Rock in round 6 \u2713\n\n7. The pattern is holding consistently over multiple rounds, which increases my confidence in this prediction.\n\n8. I should also consider that my opponent might recognize that I've figured out their pattern and change strategies, but without evidence of this yet, my best move is to follow the logical counter to their expected move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to counter their expected paper move, based on the pattern I've identified.\n\n[move] scissors\n",

This suggests:\n   - They finally realized I had figured out their pattern\n   - They purposely changed their strategy to counter my adaptation\n   - They might now be trying to predict my moves instead\n\n5. Given this change, I need to consider what their new strategy might be:\n   - They might randomly deviate from their pattern occasionally\n   - They might have switched to a new pattern\n   - They might now be trying to directly counter what they expect me to play\n\n6. If they're trying to directly counter me, they might expect me to play paper next (to beat their rock from round 10).\n   - If they expect me to play paper, they would play scissors to counter it\n   - To counter their potential scissors, I should play rock\n\n7. However, they might also return to their original pattern, in which case:\n   - After Rock in round 10, they would play Scissors in round 11\n   - To counter scissors, I should play rock\n\n8. Interestingly, both scenarios suggest playing rock is my best move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock this round. This counters scissors, which they might play either as a return to their original pattern or as a direct counter to my expected paper move.\n\n[move] rock\n",

After 9 consecutive rounds of following the \"beat my previous move\" pattern, they finally broke it in round 10. Instead of playing Paper (which would follow the pattern after their Scissors), they played Rock.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They may have finally noticed that I figured out their pattern\n   - They may be shifting to a new strategy\n   - They might be trying to counter my counter-strategy\n\n5. I need to consider what their new approach might be:\n   - They might go back to their original pattern (which would mean Paper next)\n   - They might repeat Rock again, expecting me to play Paper to counter their previous Rock\n   - They might be starting a new pattern entirely\n\n6. Given this uncertainty after a pattern break, I need a strategic approach that doesn't rely on predicting their exact move.\n\n7. Looking at the history, my most successful outcomes have been when playing Paper against Rock (+3 points). Rock is also a common first choice when players reset their strategy.\n\n8. Since they just played Rock and broke their pattern, there's a reasonable chance they might play Rock again to test if I've noticed the pattern break.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round. If they play Rock again, I gain the maximum possible points (+3). If they play Scissors, I only lose 1 point. This is a calculated risk based on the pattern disruption.\n\n[move] paper\n",

For the first time, my opponent has broken their established pattern:\n   - After Scissors in round 9, the pattern would predict Paper in round 10\n   - Instead, they played Rock\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They've realized I figured out their pattern\n   - They're adapting their strategy\n   - They may have noticed I've been countering their moves successfully\n\n5. Now I need to determine their new strategy:\n   - They might be playing completely randomly now\n   - They might have shifted to a new pattern\n   - They might be trying to counter what they predict I'll play\n\n6. In round 10, I played Scissors expecting Paper, but they played Rock. This suggests they may now be trying to anticipate and counter my moves.\n\n7. If they're trying to counter me, they might expect me to play Rock next (as it would counter their Rock from the previous round).\n\n8. If they expect me to play Rock, they would play Paper to counter it.\n\n9. To counter their potential Paper play, I should play Scissors.\n\n10. However, if they're being truly random or using a different strategy, this reasoning may not hold.\n\nFinal decision: Since their pattern change is recent and not yet established, I will play scissors this round, betting that they will play paper to counter my expected rock move.

For the first time, my opponent has broken their established pattern. After Scissors in round 9, their pattern would have predicted Paper in round 10, but they played Rock instead.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They may have finally realized I figured out their pattern\n   - They might be adopting a new strategy\n   - They could be trying to be more unpredictable now\n\n5. Since they just played Rock, I need to consider several possibilities for their next move:\n   - They might return to their original pattern (what beats their own previous move), which would mean Scissors next\n   - They might try to counter what they expect me to play\n   - They might repeat Rock since it just worked for them\n   - They might be starting a new pattern\n\n6. Without clear evidence of a new pattern yet, I need to make a cautious choice.\n\n7. If they return to their original pattern and play Scissors (to beat Paper which beats their Rock), then I should play Rock.\n\n8. If they're now trying to counter me directly, they might expect me to play Paper (to beat their Rock), and thus play Scissors to beat my Paper.\n\n9. Given the uncertainty after this pattern break, I'll base my decision on the most conservative approach, which is to counter their most recent move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round.

After consistently following the \"beat my previous move\" pattern for 9 rounds, my opponent finally broke it in round 10. Instead of playing Paper (which would beat their previous Scissors), they played Rock.\n\n4. This suggests:\n   - They likely noticed I was exploiting their pattern\n   - They've adapted their strategy to counter mine\n   - They may have played Rock specifically to beat my expected Scissors\n\n5. Now I need to determine their new strategy:\n   - They might return to their original pattern after breaking it once\n   - They might start a completely new pattern\n   - They might play randomly to be unpredictable\n   - They might try to predict what I'll do based on my past behavior\n\n6. If they're thinking I'll adapt to their pattern break, they might expect me to play Paper (to beat their Rock)\n   - In which case, they might play Scissors next\n\n7. However, they might also revert to their original pattern after breaking it once, in which case they would play Paper (to beat their own Rock)\n\n8.

If they're back to their \"beat my previous move\" pattern, after Paper in round 11, they would play Scissors next.\n\n6. However, given their recent pattern break, I shouldn't rely solely on this prediction.\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after the previous tie or pattern changes might give clues.

Looking at their most recent moves (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors), they've played the three moves in sequence.\n\n4. If they're following a standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, after Scissors they would play Rock next.\n\n5. To counter their expected Rock play, I should play Paper.\n\n6. Another possibility is that they've reverted to their original \"beat my previous move\" pattern. After playing Scissors, they would play Paper (to beat Rock, which beats their Scissors).\n\n7. However, given their recent sequence that looks like a direct R\u2192P\u2192S cycle, the Rock prediction seems more likely.\n\n8. If I play Paper:\n   - If they play Rock (as predicted by the cycle), I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Scissors, I lose 1 point\n\n9.

If they do play Rock as expected, playing Paper would give me 3 points (the highest possible).\n   - If they play Paper instead, it would be a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Scissors, I'd lose 1 point\n\n9.

Looking at their recent moves, particularly the last four (Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock), there could be a new pattern emerging:\n   - They may have shifted to a simple cyclic pattern of Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 repeat\n   - After breaking their original pattern in round 10, they've played Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - If they continue the standard cyclic pattern, they would play Rock next\n   \n4.

Another perspective:\n   - After they broke their original pattern in round 10, they might be playing randomly\n   - Or they might have reverted to their original \"beat my previous move\" pattern\n   - Their last move was Scissors, so if they follow that original pattern, they'd play Paper next\n   - To counter Paper, I should play Scissors\n\n6.

However, two data points aren't enough to confirm a mirroring strategy, and they might have realized I'm trying to predict their moves.\n\n7. Given the uncertainty and the break in their established pattern, I need a strategic approach that doesn't rely heavily on predicting their exact move.\n\n8. Since we just tied with Rock, many players would be inclined to switch to Paper to beat the previous Rock. If they do switch to Paper, my best response would be Scissors.\n\n9.

Alternatively, if they're attempting to establish a new cycle, after two Rocks, they might switch to Paper.\n\n7.

I have insufficient data to be certain of their new pattern, but the potential high reward from playing Paper against another Rock makes it worth the risk.\n\n9. Additionally, they might be trying to set up a trap by playing Rock multiple times, hoping I'll play Paper so they can switch to Scissors.

Their behavior in Round 19-20 suggests they tend to return to Rock after playing Paper, regardless of the outcome.\n\n7.

Given the uncertainty, I should recognize this is a calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round, anticipating they will play rock, following the alternating pattern they've shown in the last 4 rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I need to completely reconsider my understanding of my opponent's strategy after two consecutive incorrect predictions.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Looking at this sequence more carefully, they seem to be alternating between Rock and Scissors in the last 4 rounds.\n\n4. This could be:\n   - A deliberate alternating pattern between these two moves\n   - A reaction to the game flow that happens to create this pattern\n   - An attempt to avoid using Paper (which they may perceive as weaker)\n\n5. If they're truly alternating between Rock and Scissors, their next move would be Rock.\n\n6. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\n7. However, given that I've been wrong in my last two predictions, I should consider that:\n   - They might be aware that I'm trying to predict their moves\n   - They might specifically avoid the pattern I'm expecting\n   - They might play Paper next (which they haven't played recently)\n\n8. Looking at the full game context, when I play Paper:\n   - They've responded with Paper (tie), Rock (I win), and Scissors (I lose)\n   - When I play Rock, they've played Paper (I lose), Rock (tie), and Scissors (I win)\n   - When I play Scissors, they've played Paper (I win), Rock (I lose), and I don't have data for Scissors vs Scissors\n\n9. Given their recent alternating pattern and the fact that they've just played Scissors, Rock seems like their most probable next move.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round, anticipating they will follow their apparent alternating pattern and play rock next after their scissors.\n\n[move] paper\n",
        "I need to completely reanalyze my opponent's strategy after two consecutive incorrect predictions.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review the recent game history:\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Their pattern appears to be alternating between Rock and Scissors regardless of outcome:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This is a simple alternating pattern that I hadn't noticed before\n\n4. If they continue this alternating pattern, after Scissors, they would play Rock next.\n\n5. To counter Rock, I should play Paper.\n\n6. However, I should consider that:\n   - They might have noticed I've adjusted my strategy\n   - They might break this alternating pattern\n   - They might be using a more complex strategy than simple alternation\n\n7. Given that I've lost the last two rounds, they might continue with what's working for them.\n\n8. Looking more carefully at the entire recent sequence:\n   - Before: various patterns\n   - Recently: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This strongly suggests alternation between these two moves\n\n9. If I play Paper:\n   - If they play Rock (continuing the alternation), I win 3 points\n   - If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play Scissors again (breaking the alternation), I lose 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper this round, anticipating they will play rock based on the alternating Rock-Scissors pattern they appear to be following.\n\n[move] paper\n"
