Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, I notice paper has the highest potential gain (3 points). The risk is losing 1 point if the opponent plays scissors.\n\n4. Rock is the safest option in terms of potential loss (-1 if opponent plays paper) but offers only 1 point gain if opponent plays scissors.\n\n5. Scissors can win 1 point against paper but risks losing 3 points against rock.\n\n6. Without prior information about the opponent, I should choose the option that balances potential gain with acceptable risk.\n\n7. Given the asymmetric rewards, paper offers the highest potential gain (3 points). Many players might choose rock as their first move, making paper potentially advantageous.\n\n8. I'll choose paper for this first round, which gives me the potential for the highest score.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n\n2. This could indicate several things:\n   - My opponent might have anticipated my paper move\n   - My opponent might prefer scissors as an opening move\n   - My opponent might have made a random choice that happened to beat me\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked last time\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to rock and thus switch to paper\n   - They might randomly choose another option\n\n4. If they stick with scissors, my best move is rock (gain 1 point)\n   - If I play paper again and they play scissors again, I lose another point\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors, we tie (0 points)\n\n5. If they switch to paper anticipating my rock, I should play scissors\n   - But this is a second-level prediction which is less certain\n\n6. Since I have evidence they played scissors once, and no evidence of them playing other moves, the most straightforward strategy is to counter their previous move.\n\n7. I'll play rock this round to counter their previous scissors move. This protects against them repeating scissors and gives me a potential gain of 1 point.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This suggests:\n   - They might have a preference for playing scissors\n   - They might be using a simple strategy of sticking with what worked initially\n   - They might be predictable in their move selection\n\n4. Given this pattern, I need to consider what they'll do next:\n   - They might continue with scissors for a third time (seems unlikely after losing)\n   - They might anticipate I'll play rock again and switch to paper\n   - They might switch to rock, anticipating I'll switch to scissors\n\n5. The most likely scenario is that they'll switch from scissors after losing with it. If they're strategic, they'd play paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n6. If they switch to paper, my best counter would be scissors.\n   - If they play paper and I play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock and I play scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If they somehow play scissors again and I play scissors, it's a tie\n\n7.

What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - Round 1 to 2: They maintained scissors despite no success\n   - Round 2 to 3: After losing with scissors, they switched to paper\n   - They seem to be following a pattern: stick with winning moves, change after losing\n\n3. Based on this pattern, since they lost the last round with paper, they're likely to switch again.\n\n4. The logical switch from paper would be to rock (which beats scissors).\n\n5.

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern remains perfectly consistent:\n   - They've maintained their strict cycle of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors...\n   - They've now lost 9 consecutive rounds following this exact pattern\n   - There is zero evidence that they will deviate from this pattern\n\n3. Following their established pattern, since they just played rock and lost, they will play scissors next.\n\n4. If I predict they'll play scissors, my best counter would be rock:\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock and I play rock, it's a tie\n   - If they play paper and I play rock, I lose 3 points\n\n5. After 10 rounds with 9 consecutive wins for me, the pattern is so established that any other prediction would be irrational.\n\n6. While in a normal game against a human opponent I would expect some strategy adjustment after so many losses, this opponent has shown no adaptation whatsoever.\n\n7. Based on the overwhelming evidence, rock is my best move to counter their expected scissors play.\n\n8. I'll play rock this round to counter their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
