Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, I should understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Looking at the point structure, winning with rock (against paper) gives the highest reward (3 points), but also the highest penalty if I lose (-3 points).\n\n4. Playing scissors is interesting - it can win against rock for 1 point, but loses to paper for only -1 point.\n\n5. Paper has balanced risk/reward: can win 1 point against scissors, but lose 3 points against rock.\n\n6. Without prior information about my opponent, a reasonable strategy might be to pick randomly, but with consideration of the asymmetric payoffs.\n\n7. Since rock has the highest risk but also highest reward, I'll choose it for my first move to see how my opponent responds.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock for this first round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is interesting - after three consecutive scissors plays, they switched to paper, which I was able to beat with rock.\n\n4. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 5 times (50%)\n   - Paper: 3 times (30%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (20%)\n\n5. Their most recent move was paper. After playing scissors multiple times, they might:\n   - Return to scissors\n   - Continue with paper, thinking I'll play rock again\n   - Switch to rock to counter my expected scissors\n\n6. There seems to be an element of anticipation and counter-strategy in their play.\n\n7. If I assume they're trying to counter my expected move:\n   - They might think I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n   - In which case, they might play rock\n\n8. Or they might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked) and counter with paper again.\n\n9. Another perspective: they've never played the same move more than 3 times in a row, so they're unlikely to play paper again.\n\n10. Given all this, scissors seems like a reasonable play. It would:\n    - Beat paper if they repeat it\n    - Tie against scissors if they revert to their most common choice\n    - Only lose 1 point against rock (versus the 3-point loss if I played paper against scissors)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This is extremely unexpected - they played paper again, which means scissors should have won, but I lost. This could mean either:\n   - There was an error in recording or scoring\n   - The game rules have been misunderstood\n   - Something unusual happened\n\n4. Let me double-check the game rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n5. Wait, I've been misinterpreting a key rule. Paper doesn't lose to scissors - paper BEATS scissors. This explains the outcome.\n\n6. With this corrected understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. Given this correct understanding, and the opponent's last two moves being paper:\n   - Rock would be the best counter to paper\n   - They might anticipate this and play scissors\n   - Or they could continue with paper a third time\n\n8. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 5 times (45.5%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (36.4%)\n   - Rock: 2 times (18.2%)\n\n9. Since they've played paper twice in a row now, and with the correct rule understanding, rock seems like the best strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost (-1 points)\n12. Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n\n2. My understanding of the rules was still incorrect. Let me verify again:\n   - Paper beats rock (not scissors): winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n3. With this understanding, reviewing the results makes more sense. Let's double check a few rounds:\n   - Round 1: rock vs scissors - rock should win, but I lost (-1 points) - this doesn't match\n   - Round 10: rock vs paper - I should have lost, but I won (+3 points) - this doesn't match\n\n4. There may still be confusion about the rules. Let me try again:\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n5. This seems to match the point values, but the winners/losers are still inconsistent. Let's try one more time:\n   - Paper beats (is beaten by?) rock - this gives winner 1/-1 points\n   - Rock beats (is beaten by?) scissors - this gives winner 3/-3 points\n   - Scissors beats (is beaten by?) paper - this gives winner 1/-1 points\n\n6. Let me focus on my opponent's recent behavior: they played paper twice, then rock. This suggests they might play scissors next, continuing a rotation.\n\n7. Updated frequency analysis:\n   - Scissors: 5 times (41.7%)\n   - Paper: 4 times (33.3%)\n   - Rock: 3 times (25%)\n\n8. Given the uncertainty about the exact rule interpretation, I'll make a choice based on the opponent's pattern and frequency:\n   - If they continue a rotation (paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 ?), they might play scissors\n   - Scissors has been their most common play historically\n\n9. Playing paper seems to offer a reasonable balance of risk and reward in this situation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
