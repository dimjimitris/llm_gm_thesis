First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points for both\n\n2. I notice this is not the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors. The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points)\n   - Paper and scissors have lower rewards/penalties (1/-1 points)\n\n3. I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, so I can't predict based on past behavior.\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, rock is the high-risk, high-reward option. It gives the most points if I win, but costs the most if I lose.\n\n5. For a first move with no prior information, I should consider the expected value. If my opponent chooses randomly:\n   - If I play rock: (0 + 3 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 expected points\n   - If I play paper: ((-3) + 0 + 1)/3 = -2/3 expected points\n   - If I play scissors: (1 + (-1) + 0)/3 = 0 expected points\n\n6. Based on expected value, rock appears to be the best opening move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock as my first move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

So far, we've had two rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both players chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both players chose paper (tie)\n\n2. This suggests my opponent and I are thinking similarly, or they might be mirroring my moves.\n\n3. Looking at the emerging pattern, we've progressed from rock to paper, following the typical Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle.\n\n4. If this pattern continues, my opponent may play scissors next, following the natural progression.\n\n5. If I assume they'll play scissors, my best move would be rock, which beats scissors and gives me 3 points.\n\n6. However, the opponent might anticipate this thinking and play paper instead to counter my expected rock move.\n\n7. Another possibility is that they might stick with paper since it didn't lose last time.\n\n8. Let me consider the risk-reward balance of each move:\n   - If I play rock: Win 3 points against scissors, lose 3 points against paper, tie against rock\n   - If I play paper: Win 1 point against scissors, lose 3 points against rock, tie against paper\n   - If I play scissors: Win 1 point against paper, lose 1 point against rock, tie against scissors\n\n9. Given the pattern observed and the potential for my opponent to follow the natural cycle to scissors, playing rock offers the highest potential reward (3 points) if I'm correct.\n\n10. While playing rock carries the risk of losing 3 points if my opponent plays paper, I believe the pattern analysis justifies taking this calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I was expecting scissors based on the pattern, but incorrectly thought rock would beat scissors in this variant.

My current score is now +2 points total.\n\n9. Given the pattern observed, after playing paper, my opponent has frequently switched to scissors (rounds 3, 7) or rock (round 5).\n\n10. If they follow their historical pattern after paper, they might play scissors or rock next.\n    - If they play scissors and I play paper, I would win (+1)\n    - If they play rock and I play paper, I would lose (-3)\n\n11. Paper seems risky given the possibility of rock. Scissors would be a safer play as it beats rock in this variant and would only tie against scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, which would win against rock and tie against scissors.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After playing scissors, their previous patterns suggest they might play:\n   - Rock (they played rock after scissors in round 8)\n   - Paper (they played paper after scissors in round 4)\n\n6. There's no consistent pattern after they play scissors, but looking at their overall sequence, they might be due for rock as they haven't played it recently.\n\n7. If they play rock and I play scissors, I would win (+1).\n   If they play paper and I play scissors, I would lose (-1).\n   If they play scissors again and I play scissors, we would tie (0).\n\n8. Given that rock would give me a high reward (+3) if they play paper and would only risk a small loss (-1) if they play scissors, rock seems like a reasonable choice with good upside potential.\n\n9. However, considering they just played scissors and might be anticipating my rock play, they could play paper to counter it.\n\n10. Taking everything into account, paper seems like a strategic choice - it would win against scissors if they repeat (+1), lose against rock (-3), but I think the probability of them playing scissors again or switching to paper is higher than them playing rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

To confirm the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\n5. I notice my opponent has now played paper 6 times (most frequently), followed by rock and scissors (both 3 or 4 times each).\n\n6. Looking at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - After paper in rounds 2, 4, 6, 9: they often played scissors next\n   - After paper in round 11: they played rock\n   - After paper in round 13: ?\n\n7.

Wait, I made a mistake in my reasoning. According to the rules of this variant:\n   - If they play scissors and I play paper, I would lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock, I would lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors and I play scissors, we would tie (0)\n\n10. Reconsidering, if they follow their most common pattern and play scissors after paper, none of my options would win, but scissors would at least tie.\n\n11. Given that they've sometimes broken the pattern, I should consider other possibilities:\n    - If they play rock and I play scissors, I would win (+1)\n    - If they play paper and I play rock, I would win (+3)\n\n12. Since scissors gives me a tie against their most likely move and a win against rock, while rock and paper both risk losses, scissors seems like the safest play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. They have now played paper 8 times, scissors 5 times, and rock 4 times.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - After paper in rounds 2, 4, 6, 9, 13: they played scissors next\n   - After paper in round 11: they played rock\n   - After paper in round 15: they played scissors\n   - After paper in round 17: ?\n\n6. They've played scissors after paper 6 times out of 7, showing an extremely strong tendency.\n\n7. If they follow this pattern and play scissors:\n   - Scissors vs my paper would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my rock would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my scissors would tie (0)\n\n8. If they break the pattern and play rock:\n   - Rock vs my paper would give me a loss (-3)\n   - Rock vs my rock would tie (0)\n   - Rock vs my scissors would give me a win (+1)\n\n9. If they play paper again:\n   - Paper vs my paper would tie (0)\n   - Paper vs my rock would give me a win (+3)\n   - Paper vs my scissors would give me a loss (-1)\n\n10. Given their extremely strong tendency to play scissors after paper (6/7 times), and that scissors is the only move that can at least tie against scissors, playing scissors seems optimal.\n\n11. Additionally, they might start to recognize that I'm exploiting their paper plays with rock, so they might adjust their strategy accordingly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, expecting them to play scissors based on their historical pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

There's a very strong pattern that after playing scissors, they tend to play paper (4/5 times or 80%).\n\n6. If they follow this pattern and play paper:\n   - Paper vs my paper would tie (0)\n   - Paper vs my rock would give me a win (+3)\n   - Paper vs my scissors would give me a loss (-1)\n\n7.

Given their strong tendency to play paper after scissors (80% of the time), and the high reward for correctly predicting paper (+3 with rock), rock seems like the best calculated risk.\n\n10. This strategy has been highly successful for me in the past rounds when predicting their paper plays.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll play paper based on their historical pattern after scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played scissors twice in a row, which they hadn't done previously in the game. This suggests they might be changing their strategy.\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after playing scissors (before this last round):\n   - After scissors in rounds 3, 7, 10, 14, 16: they played paper 4 times and rock once\n   \n6. Now they've played scissors after scissors, breaking their typical pattern.\n\n7. After playing scissors twice in a row (which is new), I don't have historical data to predict their next move.\n\n8. Consider the overall game pattern:\n   - They've played paper 8 times, scissors 6 times, and rock 4 times\n   - Recently they seem to be favoring scissors more\n\n9. If they play scissors for a third time:\n   - Scissors vs my paper would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my rock would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my scissors would tie (0)\n\n10. If they switch to paper:\n    - Paper vs my paper would tie (0)\n    - Paper vs my rock would give me a win (+3)\n    - Paper vs my scissors would give me a loss (-1)\n\n11. If they switch to rock:\n    - Rock vs my paper would give me a loss (-3)\n    - Rock vs my rock would tie (0)\n    - Rock vs my scissors would give me a win (+1)\n\n12. Given they've broken their pattern and played scissors twice in a row, they might be trying to counter my strategy. Playing scissors would at least guarantee a tie if they play scissors a third time.\n\n13. However, they might also anticipate me playing scissors and switch to rock. In that case, paper would be my best response.\n\n14. Since they've shown they're willing to break patterns now, I should be more cautious. Paper is risky against potential scissors, but would beat rock and tie against paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, as it guarantees a tie against scissors and wins against rock, which they might switch to after playing scissors twice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If they follow this pattern and play paper:\n   - Paper vs my paper would tie (0)\n   - Paper vs my rock would give me a win (+3)\n   - Paper vs my scissors would give me a loss (-1)\n\n7. If they play rock:\n   - Rock vs my paper would give me a loss (-3)\n   - Rock vs my rock would tie (0)\n   - Rock vs my scissors would give me a win (+1)\n\n8. If they play scissors again:\n   - Scissors vs my paper would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my rock would give me a loss (-1)\n   - Scissors vs my scissors would tie (0)\n\n9. Given their strong tendency to play paper after scissors, and the high reward (+3) for correctly predicting paper with rock, playing rock seems like a reasonable calculated risk.\n\n10. This strategy has been highly successful for me throughout the game when predicting their paper plays after scissors (rounds 9, 13, 15, 17, 22).\n\n11. They might be catching on to my strategy, but their behavior has been fairly consistent throughout the game, suggesting they may continue with their established patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll play paper based on their historical pattern after scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"
