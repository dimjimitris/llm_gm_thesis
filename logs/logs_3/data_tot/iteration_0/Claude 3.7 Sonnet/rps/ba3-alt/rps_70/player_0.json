Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock.\n   - This resulted in me losing 3 points since rock beats paper (giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points).\n\n2. I need to analyze what this might tell me about my opponent:\n   - They chose rock in the first round\n   - This could be random, or it could indicate a preference for rock\n   - They might expect me to change my strategy after losing\n\n3.

New pattern hypothesis: They may be establishing a cycle of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, with decreasing sequence lengths:\n   - 3 rounds of rock\n   - 6 rounds of paper\n   - 5 rounds of scissors\n   - Now back to rock\n\n4. If they continue with rock as part of a new sequence, scissors would be the optimal response (+1 point).\n\n5. Given that they've just switched to rock and have previously demonstrated a tendency to stick with the same move for multiple rounds, it's highly likely they will play rock again.\n\n6.

The opponent's pattern shows:\n   - Initial 3 rounds of rock\n   - 6 rounds of paper\n   - 5 rounds of scissors\n   - 4 rounds of rock\n   - Now 1 round of paper in the new sequence\n\n3. They have switched to paper after 4 rounds of rock, maintaining their cycle of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\n4. Based on their previous pattern of extended sequences, they are likely to continue with paper for multiple rounds.\n\n5. Given they played paper for 6 rounds in their previous paper sequence, they will likely maintain paper for at least several more rounds.\n\n6. If they continue with paper as their pattern suggests, rock would be the optimal choice (+3 points).\n\n7. The higher reward for rock beating paper (+3 points) makes this an especially appealing choice against their likely continued paper play.\n\n8. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with moves for extended periods, and that they've just switched to paper (which they previously played for 6 rounds), rock is clearly the optimal strategic choice.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
