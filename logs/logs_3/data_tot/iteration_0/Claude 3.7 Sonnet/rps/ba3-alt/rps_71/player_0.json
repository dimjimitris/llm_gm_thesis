He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This breaks the perfect matching pattern we had previously established.\n\n3. There are a few possible interpretations:\n   - My opponent may have been trying to predict my moves all along and got it wrong this time\n   - My opponent might have been deliberately matching me for 4 rounds, then decided to try winning\n   - The pattern was coincidental and has now broken down\n\n4. Now I need to predict what they'll do next after winning with scissors:\n   - Commonly, players tend to repeat a winning move (\"stay with a winner\" psychology)\n   - If my opponent chooses scissors again, I should play rock to win (+1 points)\n   - If my opponent anticipates this and plays paper, I would lose (-3 points)\n\n5. Another possibility is they'll try to counter what they think I'll play. If they think I'll play rock to counter their previous scissors, they might play paper.\n\n6.

Given that they won with scissors and the \"stay with a winner\" psychology is strong, I think there's a good chance they'll repeat scissors. Playing rock would counter this effectively.\n\n8.

Now after both choosing paper, conventional wisdom might suggest:\n   - I would choose scissors to beat their expected paper\n   - They might choose scissors for the same reason\n   - Or they might choose rock anticipating my scissors\n\n6. Given our history of matching, I need to consider what they would expect me to do.\n\n7.

Given our pattern of frequent matching, and that scissors is the logical next move after paper, I'll choose rock to counter the scissors that both of us might naturally gravitate toward.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating a scissors play from my opponent (either as a counter to paper or as an attempt to match what they think I'll play).\n\n[move] rock\n"

I've tried numerous strategies and approaches to break the pattern, but the matching has persisted through rounds 10-20 without exception.\n\n6. Given this extraordinary pattern, I can only conclude that either:\n   - My opponent can somehow see my moves before making theirs\n   - The game is programmed to match my moves by default (with occasional exceptions)\n   - My opponent is using exactly the same decision-making algorithm as I am\n\n7. For this round, I'll choose paper, continuing the natural progression from rock.\n\n8. Based on all previous evidence, I fully expect my opponent will also choose paper, resulting in our 19th tie.\n\n9. At this point, I've accepted that conventional game theory doesn't apply to this unusual scenario, and I'm simply documenting the extraordinary matching phenomenon.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, expecting another match based on the overwhelming pattern established over 20 rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated match history:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n   - Rounds 6-8: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won 1 point\n   - Rounds 10-20: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n\n2. Out of 21 rounds, 18 have been matches (86% rate), with only 3 rounds where our choices differed.\n\n3. My score is now -1 points after 21 rounds (-1 from round 5, +1 from round 9, -1 from round 21).\n\n4. Interestingly, this third non-matching round follows the exact same pattern as our first divergence in round 5: I played paper, they played scissors.\n\n5. It seems that after a long streak of matches, my opponent chose to play scissors when I chose paper, just like in round 5.\n\n6. This could suggest that there might be a pattern to when the matching streak breaks.\n\n7. Given our history and this new development, what should I play next?\n   - If this follows our previous pattern after a non-match, we might return to matching for several rounds\n   - After they played scissors and beat my paper, conventional wisdom would suggest I play rock next\n\n8. If my opponent expects me to play rock (to counter their scissors), they might play paper (to counter my rock).\n\n9. However, given our predominant history of matching, there's still a strong chance they'll play whatever I play.\n\n10. If I play scissors and they match, we tie.\n    If I play scissors and they play rock (countering), I lose 1 point.\n    If I play scissors and they play paper (continuing the countering pattern), I win 1 point.\n\n11. Given the uncertainty after this break in our matching pattern, scissors seems like a reasonable choice with balanced risk/reward.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, which offers a reasonable balance of possibilities given our unusual game history and recent break in the matching pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Updated match history:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n   - Rounds 6-8: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won 1 point\n   - Rounds 10-20: Perfect matches leading to ties\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost 1 point\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won 1 point\n\n2. Out of 22 rounds, 18 have been matches (82% rate), with 4 rounds where our choices differed.\n\n3. My score is now 0 points again after 22 rounds (-1 from round 5, +1 from round 9, -1 from round 21, +1 from round 22).\n\n4. This is getting very interesting. For only the second time in the game, I won with scissors against rock - exactly like round 9.\n\n5. The pattern of non-matching rounds has become:\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n\n6. This suggests they might be alternating between scissors and rock on non-matching rounds, or there's some other pattern at work.\n\n7. After our previous non-matching rounds (5 and 9), we returned to a long streak of matching. Will that happen again?\n\n8. Since they just played rock and I played scissors, conventional wisdom would suggest I play paper next (to beat their expected rock).\n\n9. However, if they're following some alternating pattern for non-matching rounds, they might play scissors next.\n\n10. Given the strong history of matching for most rounds, there's still a good chance they'll simply match whatever I play.\n\n11. If I play rock:\n    - If they match: tie (0 points)\n    - If they play scissors (following potential alternating pattern): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play paper (conventional counter to my previous scissors): I lose (-3 points)\n\n12. The risk of losing 3 points with rock seems too high. Let me consider paper instead:\n    - If they match: tie (0 points)\n    - If they play rock (matching their previous move): I win (+1 point)\n    - If they play scissors (following potential alternating pattern): I lose (-1 point)\n\n13. Paper seems to offer a better risk/reward profile given our history and patterns.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, which offers a balanced risk/reward profile given our game history and the emerging patterns in non-matching rounds.\n\n[move] paper\n"
