Let me analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points for both\n\n2. This is not a standard Rock, Paper, Scissors game because the payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Rock has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3)\n   - Paper and Scissors have lower rewards (+1) and lower risks (-1)\n\n3. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to consider the expected value of each move:\n   - If I choose Rock: +3 if opponent chooses Paper, -1 if opponent chooses Scissors, 0 if opponent chooses Rock\n   - If I choose Paper: +1 if opponent chooses Scissors, -3 if opponent chooses Rock, 0 if opponent chooses Paper\n   - If I choose Scissors: +1 if opponent chooses Rock, -1 if opponent chooses Paper, 0 if opponent chooses Scissors\n\n4. Since this is the first round, the opponent has no information about my strategy yet. They likely will make a random choice or use Rock as it has the highest potential payoff.\n\n5. Given the asymmetric payoffs, Rock has the highest risk-reward ratio. If I want to be cautious in the first round, Paper might be safer as it risks -3 but could gain +1.\n\n6. Since this is just the first round of what might be multiple rounds, I'll use a balanced approach. Rock offers the highest potential reward, which could give me an early advantage.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for the first move to aim for the higher payoff, accepting the risk.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

However, my opponent might also stick with Scissors after a win, as it worked for them.\n\n8.

A common strategy in RPS when playing against someone who seems to be reading your mind is to play \"against yourself\" - that is, choose the option you least want to choose.\n\n11. My instinct after Paper would be to play either Rock or Scissors. Playing \"against myself\" would suggest staying with Paper.\n\n12. But if my opponent is thinking the same way, we'd tie again with Paper.\n\n13. I need to make a choice that feels counterintuitive, without obvious justification from game theory or pattern analysis.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for this round. This choice doesn't follow from any obvious pattern but might break our cycle of ties simply by being a move I wouldn't normally make given our history.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The non-ties in our game have both been the same: I played Rock and lost to Scissors.\n\n3. This is a critical pattern. Both times I chose Rock after a Paper round, my opponent chose Scissors instead of mirroring me.\n\n4. This suggests my opponent might have a specific strategy when I play Rock following Paper.\n\n5. Our updated move frequency:\n   - Rock: 6 times (for me)\n   - Paper: 4 times (for me)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (for me)\n\n6.

Wait - this is unexpected! I won by playing Paper against Scissors, which typically shouldn't happen according to the standard rules.\n\n3. Let me re-check the game rules: \n   - Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n   - Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n   - Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points.\n\n4. In this variant, Paper beats Scissors (not the reverse as in traditional RPS). This is crucial information that I need to incorporate into my strategy.\n\n5. So the correct matchups are:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\n6. With this understanding, my previous loss in Round 13 makes sense - they played Scissors which beat my Rock.\n\n7. Now I need to recalibrate my entire approach based on these rules.\n\n8. My opponent has played Scissors in the last two rounds. Given their apparent pattern of mirroring me except in specific situations, they might switch to a different move now.\n\n9. If they play Rock, my best response would be Scissors.\n   If they play Paper, my best response would be Rock.\n   If they play Scissors again, my best response would be Paper.\n\n10. Since my opponent has shown a preference for Scissors (playing it in 5 out of 14 rounds now), Paper might be a good strategic choice.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate me continuing with Paper after my win, and switch to Rock to counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. If my opponent switches to Rock (to counter my anticipated Paper), my Scissors would beat their Rock. If they continue with Scissors, we tie. If they switch to Paper, I lose but with minimal penalty (-1).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This reveals a very clear pattern: Every time I've played Rock in a non-tie situation (Rounds 6, 13, and 16), my opponent has played Scissors and I've lost.\n\n3. My current score is now:\n   - Wins: 1 (+1 point)\n   - Losses: 4 (-1 point each for a total of -4)\n   - Net score: -3 points\n\n4. My opponent is showing a strong preference for playing Scissors (now 7 out of 16 rounds) and particularly seems to anticipate when I'll play Rock.\n\n5. The rules remain:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\n6.

My opponent seems to favor Scissors when I play Rock, and Paper when I play Scissors. This suggests a strategic pattern I can exploit.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. This counters my opponent's apparent preference for Scissors and has already won me one round. Even if they anticipate this and play Rock, the risk (-3) is justified given my current negative score and the need to attempt to gain points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Looking at when my opponent broke from mirroring:\n   - When I played Rock, they played Scissors (3 times)\n   - When I played Paper, they played Scissors (once) and Rock (once)\n   - When I played Scissors, they played Paper (once)\n\n9. My opponent seems to have a slight tendency toward Rock (7/17 rounds) and a strong tendency to play Scissors against my Rock.\n\n10. After their success with Rock against my Paper, they might:\n    - Continue with Rock, expecting me to avoid Paper\n    - Switch to Paper, expecting me to play Rock to counter their Rock\n    - Play Scissors, expecting me to play Paper again\n\n11. Given their recent success in anticipating my moves, playing defensively might be wise.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. While Rock might seem tempting to counter their potential Paper, they've shown they can anticipate such straightforward counters. Scissors is my least-used move recently and might be less expected. If they play Rock again, I lose (-1), but this is better than losing with Paper (-3). If they play Paper, I win (+1). If they play Scissors, we tie.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I've now lost four consecutive rounds, with my opponent correctly countering each of my moves.\n\n4. The pattern of non-ties now shows:\n    - Round 6: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n    - Round 13: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n    - Round 14: Paper vs Scissors (I won +1)\n    - Round 15: Scissors vs Paper (I lost -1)\n    - Round 16: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n    - Round 17: Paper vs Rock (I lost -3)\n    - Round 18: Scissors vs Paper (I lost -1)\n\n5. My opponent has played each move against me at least once in the last three rounds:\n   - Round 16: They played Scissors against my Rock\n   - Round 17: They played Rock against my Paper\n   - Round 18: They played Paper against my Scissors\n\n6. This suggests they might have a consistent strategy for predicting and countering my moves.\n\n7. After losing with Scissors against Paper, I might be expected to:\n   - Play Rock to beat their Paper\n   - Continue with Scissors expecting them to switch\n   - Switch to Paper to try something different\n\n8. My opponent's move frequencies are now:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n9. Given their success in predicting my moves, they might expect me to play Rock next (the logical counter to their Paper).\n\n10. If they anticipate Rock, they might play Scissors.\n\n11. However, if I play Paper and they play Scissors expecting Rock, I would win.\n\n12. Given my significant point deficit, I need to take some risks to try to win back points.\n\n13. Since my opponent has beaten me with Paper in the last round, they might stick with that move expecting me to switch to Rock. If they do, and I play Paper again, we would tie.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. While this might seem counterintuitive after losing to Paper, it disrupts the expected pattern where I would play Rock to counter their Paper. If they play Rock expecting me to play Paper again, I lose heavily (-3), but this risk is necessary given my current score deficit. If they play Paper again, we tie. If they play Scissors expecting me to play Rock, I win (+1).\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Our complete game history now shows:\n   - Round 1: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 6: Rock vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 8: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 9: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 10: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: Rock vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 14: Paper vs Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: Scissors vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: Rock vs Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 17: Paper vs Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 18: Scissors vs Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 19: Paper vs Scissors (I won)\n\n2. My current score is now:\n   - Wins: 2 (+1 point \u00d7 2 rounds = +2)\n   - Losses: 6 (-1 point \u00d7 5 rounds, -3 points \u00d7 1 round = -8)\n   - Net score: -6 points\n\n3. Interestingly, both of my wins have been with Paper against Scissors, which confirms the rule that Paper beats Scissors in this variant.\n\n4. Looking at the non-tie patterns:\n   - Round 6: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 13: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 14: Paper vs Scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: Scissors vs Paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 17: Paper vs Rock (I lost -3)\n   - Round 18: Scissors vs Paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: Paper vs Scissors (I won +1)\n\n5. A pattern emerges: When I played Paper against Scissors, I won both times. When I played Scissors, I lost. When I played Rock against Scissors, I lost every time.\n\n6. My opponent's move frequencies are now:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n7. My opponent played Scissors in the last round, likely expecting me to play Rock (which would have lost to Scissors).\n\n8. After I won with Paper against their Scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to Rock to counter my potential repeat of Paper\n   - Continue with Scissors expecting me to switch after a win\n   - Switch to Paper as a balanced approach\n\n9. Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate my moves in previous rounds, they likely will expect me to either:\n   - Continue with Paper after my win\n   - Switch to Rock thinking they'll play Scissors again\n   - Switch to Scissors as a general change\n\n10. My opponent may anticipate that I would continue with Paper after winning, and might play Rock to counter.\n\n11. However, they might also think I would anticipate this and play Scissors instead, to which they might respond with Paper.\n\n12. Given the double win with Paper against Scissors, there's a pattern that Paper has been successful against my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Scissors for this round. If my opponent expects me to continue with Paper after my win and plays Rock, my Scissors will lose (-1), but this is a calculated risk. If they play Paper expecting me to switch to Scissors (thinking I'll anticipate their Rock), I'll win (+1). If they play Scissors again, we tie. This is a balanced choice that avoids the heavy penalty of losing with Paper against Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I've now lost with Scissors against Paper twice in a row (Rounds 18 and 20).\n\n5. My opponent's move frequencies are now more balanced:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n6. My opponent seems to have a pattern of playing Paper against my Scissors. They've done this in Rounds 15, 18, and now 20.\n\n7. After winning with Paper in Round 19, I switched to Scissors and lost. My opponent correctly anticipated this switch.\n\n8. Given my opponent's repeated success with Paper against my Scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with Paper, expecting me to play Scissors again\n   - Switch to Rock, anticipating I'll switch to Paper\n   - Switch to Scissors, expecting me to play Rock to counter their Paper\n\n9. My own pattern shows I've been cycling through moves somewhat predictably, which my opponent seems able to anticipate.\n\n10. To break this pattern, I need to make a less predictable choice.\n\n11. Given my significant point deficit, I need to aim for the highest possible gain. Rock beating Paper would give me +3 points.\n\n12. However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays Scissors, I lose again (-1).\n\n13. Looking at the history of non-ties, Paper has been my most successful move, winning twice against Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Rock for this round. This aims for the highest possible gain (+3) if my opponent plays Paper again. While there's risk if they play Scissors, my current score deficit means I need to take calculated risks for higher rewards. If they play Rock, we tie. If they play Paper, I win significantly (+3). If they play Scissors, I lose (-1).\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent seems to have a strong read on my strategy and is countering effectively.\n\n9. Given that I've lost repeatedly with both Rock and Scissors, Paper appears to be my most successful move.\n\n10. However, my opponent might anticipate me returning to Paper and play Rock to counter.\n\n11. I need to break from apparent patterns and make a less predictable choice.\n\n12. Since my opponent has played Scissors for the last round, they might:\n    - Switch to Rock, expecting me to play Paper\n    - Continue with Scissors, expecting me to avoid Paper\n    - Switch to Paper as a balanced approach\n\n13. Given my significant negative score, I need to aim for wins rather than just avoiding losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for this round. Although risky if my opponent plays Rock (-3), it's the only move that has won me points so far. If they continue with Scissors, I win (+1). If they play Paper, we tie.
