Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If I anticipate my opponent might choose rock first, I should choose paper.\n5. At the same time, if my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate this thinking and choose scissors.\n6. Since this is a fresh game, I'll start with a standard opening move and then adapt my strategy based on what happens.\n7.

They seem to be alternating between scissors and rock in the last four rounds.\n\n5. If this alternating pattern continues, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. Under our reversed rules, paper beats scissors.\n\n7. However, given that I've lost several consecutive rounds, they might be accurately predicting my moves.\n\n8. I need to break any pattern they might have identified in my play.\n\n9. Looking more closely at their pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock, they might indeed play scissors next.\n\n10. Given my recent losses, I should take a calculated risk and trust the pattern I've observed.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they will continue their alternating pattern and play scissors next.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Under our reversed rules, if they play scissors as I suspect, paper would be my best move.\n\n7. But given my recent difficulty predicting their moves, I should consider what has worked in the past.\n\n8. Looking at the overall history, I've had more success when I've played scissors than with other moves.\n\n9. Given the psychological complexity at this point and the fact that they've just broken their pattern, I'll try scissors, which would beat rock if they switch to that.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, which would beat rock if they switch to that after breaking their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
