After playing the same move three times in a row, players often change their move.\n\n5. They may also be confused by the unusual winning conditions, which might influence their next move.\n\n6. If they continue with scissors, my best move would be paper again.\n\n7. If they switch to paper (their most common move historically), my best move would be rock.\n\n8.

Critical observations:\n   - They switched from rock to paper after losing\n   - Current record: 11 wins, 6 losses, 5 ties\n   - They've played paper (9 times), rock (6 times), scissors (7 times)\n   - They're showing adaptive strategy, often countering my previous successful move\n\n4. After winning with paper, they might continue with paper.\n\n5. Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be trying to anticipate my moves.\n\n6. If they play paper again, rock would be my best choice.\n\n7. If they switch to rock, scissors would be best.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors, paper would be best.\n\n9. Given their tendency to persist with winning moves and their paper preference overall, rock seems the most strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

After losing, they typically change their move, suggesting they might not play paper again.\n\n5. However, they've sometimes persisted with moves despite losing.\n\n6. If they continue with paper, rock would again be my best choice.\n\n7. If they switch to scissors, paper would be best.\n\n8. If they switch to rock, scissors would be best.\n\n9. Given their pattern in recent rounds and my success with rock against their paper, I'll stay with rock - it would beat paper if they persist, and beat scissors if they switch to that.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"
