Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The most logical strategy against someone who just played paper would be to play scissors, as it beats paper.\n\n5. However, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they would anticipate this and play rock to counter my scissors.\n\n6.

The most strategic move depends on what I think they'll do next:\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play paper\n   - If they continue with paper, I should play rock again\n   - If they return to rock, I should play scissors\n\n7. The most likely scenario is that they will switch to scissors to counter my rock. Therefore, I'll play paper which beats scissors in the reversed rules.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent has shown the following pattern:\n   - 7 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 3-9)\n   - 2 rounds of paper (rounds 10-11)\n   - 1 round of paper again (round 12)\n\n3. We've had another tie, meaning my opponent also switched to paper - perhaps predicting my move.\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Starting to mirror my moves\n   - Trying to anticipate my strategy\n   - Breaking their pattern of staying with one move for multiple rounds\n\n5. After a tie with paper, typical rock-paper-scissors strategy would suggest:\n   - Many players would switch to scissors, expecting their opponent to play paper again\n   - Some would play rock, anticipating their opponent will switch to scissors\n   - Others might stick with paper, expecting a double-switch\n\n6. Given the reversed rules and my opponent's history of sticking with moves for multiple rounds, I think they'll either:\n   - Stay with paper for at least one more round (their pattern suggests multi-round commitment)\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my anticipated rock play\n\n7. If they stay with paper, rock would be my best move.\n   If they switch to scissors, paper would be my best move.\n\n8.

            "text": "I'll analyze the pattern for this twenty-second round.\n\nSteps:\n1. Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n\n2. The opponent has now played rock for four consecutive rounds (18-21), maintaining their pattern of sticking with each move for multiple rounds:\n   - 7 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 3-9)\n   - 5 consecutive rounds of paper (rounds 10-14)\n   - 3 consecutive rounds of scissors (rounds 15-17)\n   - Now 4 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 18-21)\n\n3. They've lost the last three rounds playing rock against my scissors, but their historical behavior shows remarkable persistence with each move regardless of outcomes.\n\n4. Their pattern of play shows they typically stay with a move for:\n   - Rock: 7+ rounds\n   - Paper: 5 rounds\n   - Scissors: 3 rounds\n   - And now back to rock: 4 rounds so far\n\n5. Based on their established pattern, they're likely to continue with rock for at least a few more rounds before switching, given their extraordinary persistence shown with rock in the first part of the game.\n\n6. Under the reversed rules, scissors beats rock, so scissors continues to be my optimal choice against their anticipated rock play.\n\n7. While they may eventually switch after multiple consecutive losses, their clear pattern throughout the entire game suggests they'll continue with rock for at least another round or two.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: Both chose rock (tie)\n   - Round 6: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 13: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won)\n   - Round 15: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 21: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I won)\n   - Round 22: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I lost)\n\n2. My opponent has switched from rock to paper after playing rock for 4 consecutive rounds.\n\n3. This somewhat breaks their established pattern of extended commitment to each move:\n   - 7 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 3-9)\n   - 5 consecutive rounds of paper (rounds 10-14)\n   - 3 consecutive rounds of scissors (rounds 15-17)\n   - 4 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 18-21)\n   - Now back to paper (round 22)\n\n4. This could indicate:\n   - They're becoming more adaptive after losing multiple rounds\n   - Their pattern of persistence might be shortening\n   - They may be starting a new cycle with paper\n\n5. Based on their previous behavior, they typically stick with paper for around 5 rounds, so they're likely to continue with paper for several more rounds.\n\n6. Under the reversed rules, rock beats paper, so rock would be my optimal choice against their anticipated paper play.\n\n7. While their pattern is becoming slightly less predictable with a shorter run of rock this time, their overall tendency to stick with each move for multiple rounds suggests they'll likely continue with paper for at least the next few rounds.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent has now played paper for two consecutive rounds (22-23), beginning what appears to be their next cycle.\n\n3. Their pattern throughout the game shows they typically stick with each move for multiple rounds:\n   - 7 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 3-9)\n   - 5 consecutive rounds of paper (rounds 10-14)\n   - 3 consecutive rounds of scissors (rounds 15-17)\n   - 4 consecutive rounds of rock (rounds 18-21)\n   - Now 2 consecutive rounds of paper (rounds 22-23)\n\n4. Despite losing the last round with paper against my rock, their historical behavior suggests they'll continue playing paper for several more rounds before switching.\n\n5. Based on their previous paper cycle (5 rounds), they're likely to continue with paper for approximately 3 more rounds.\n\n6. Under the reversed rules, rock beats paper, so rock continues to be my optimal choice against their anticipated paper play.\n\n7. While they may eventually adapt their strategy due to consecutive losses, their consistent pattern throughout the game suggests they'll maintain their paper play for at least another round or two before switching.\n\n[move] rock\n"
