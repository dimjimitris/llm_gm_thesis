    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - Skilled at identifying patterns in opponent behavior\n3. Psychological Strategist - Understands human decision-making tendencies\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any information about their tendencies. In standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game theory, the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, studies show that rock is often a common first move choice for new players, so paper might give us a slight edge.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first round, we can't identify patterns yet. However, we should note that many people choose rock as their first move because it symbolizes strength. Paper would be a strategic counter to this tendency.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with the others. Research on Rock-Paper-Scissors suggests that rock is a common first move, especially for males. Additionally, since the AI is making the first move here, choosing paper presents a reasonable psychological advantage against a potential rock opener.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with paper for the first move, then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response in subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We played paper and the opponent played scissors, which means they beat us in the first round. This gives us our first data point about their behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: There are several possibilities here:\n1. The opponent randomly chose scissors\n2. They anticipated our paper play (perhaps they also know the \"first-timers often play rock\" heuristic and went one step ahead)\n3. They have a preference for scissors regardless of context\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often stick with a winning move, so there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again. If they're more sophisticated, they might expect us to switch to rock (to beat their scissors), and thus they might switch to paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that information, our best move would be rock. If they repeat scissors (which winners often do), we'll win. If they anticipate us switching to rock and play paper instead, we'll lose, but that requires more sophisticated thinking.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with playing rock. It's our best response if they repeat scissors, and we don't have enough information yet to make more complex predictions about their strategy.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Rock is the logical choice here. It counters scissors if they repeat their winning move, which is a common psychological pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This suggests they may be shifting their strategy each round.\n\nGame Theorist: Their pattern so far is: scissors \u2192 rock. If they follow a rotating pattern, their next move could be paper. Alternatively, they might be countering what they think we'll play next. After a tie, many players will switch their move, expecting their opponent to do the same.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Switch to what would have beaten the tied move (in this case, paper to beat rock)\n2. Switch to what would be beaten by the tied move (scissors), expecting the opponent to switch to paper\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're following a simple rotation (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they'll play paper next. If they're trying to counter our anticipated move, it's more complex.\n\nGame Theorist: Given what we know, scissors would be our optimal play. It beats paper if they're following a rotation, and it beats paper if they're expecting us to play rock again and countering with paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with scissors.

To counter scissors, we should play rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: It's also worth noting that they've now won 2 rounds and tied 1. When players are winning, they often stick with a working strategy. The rotational pattern seems to be working for them, so there's a good chance they'll continue it.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let me double-check our pattern analysis. The standard RPS cycle is rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. Their moves have been scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which actually follows a counter-clockwise rotation. If they continue this pattern, scissors would indeed be next.\n\nGame Theorist: You're right about the direction of rotation. If they play scissors next (continuing their counter-clockwise pattern), our best response would be rock.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing rock. It counters scissors if they maintain their pattern, and even if they try to outthink us, rock is a solid choice after losing a round as it represents strength and many players gravitate toward it after a loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The fact that they played scissors in Round 4 actually suggests they might be repeating their first move (scissors) after completing a cycle.\n\nPsychological Strategist: It's also possible they're responding to our moves rather than following their own pattern.
