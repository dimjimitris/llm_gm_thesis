I need to determine my first move against a fresh player with no history.\n2. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, no single move is inherently stronger than others.\n3. Since this is the first move with no prior history, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value.\n4. Some players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n5. If I anticipate this tendency, paper would be a strategic counter.\n6. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n7. Without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I should avoid being too predictable.\n8.

The rules state: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" This seems to be a modification of the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.\n4. So in this variant, paper beats scissors (opposite of traditional rules).\n5. My opponent played scissors in the first round.\n6. They might:\n   - Continue with scissors thinking I'll change my move\n   - Switch to rock expecting me to play paper again\n   - Switch to paper to counter a potential rock move from me\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
