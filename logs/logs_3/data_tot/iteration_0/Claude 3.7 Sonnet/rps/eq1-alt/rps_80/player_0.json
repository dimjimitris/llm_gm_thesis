    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My score is now +3 (9 wins, 7 losses, 3 ties), with five consecutive losses.\n\n4. My opponent has broken my prediction again. Their last five moves have been rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n5. This sequence doesn't follow the previous cycling pattern I thought I observed.\n\n6. They've now played rock 9 times (almost half their moves), showing a strong preference for it.\n\n7. After winning with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Continue with rock after its success\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to paper if they're continuing some pattern I haven't identified\n\n8. Given their success and preference for rock, they might stick with it again.\n\n9. However, they might also be deliberately playing against my expectations.\n\n10. At this point, my attempts to predict their moves have failed repeatedly, suggesting either:\n    - They are successfully reading and countering my strategy\n    - They have developed a highly effective pattern that I haven't detected\n    - They are playing truly randomly\n\n11. Since previous approaches have failed, I'll try a completely different strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors. This would beat their rock if they repeat it, which has been their most common move overall.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

This shows a very clear pattern of cycling through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper repeatedly.\n\n6. If they continue this exact pattern, their next move would be scissors.\n\n7. However, this pattern is so obvious that they might deliberately break it, anticipating that I've noticed it.\n\n8. The opponent has been extremely successful in countering my moves for six consecutive rounds.\n\n9. Given that all attempts at prediction have failed, and they appear to be expertly countering my moves, I need a completely different approach.\n\n10. Since they seem to be able to anticipate my choices, I'll try something unexpected.\n\n11. Looking at the overall game, rock has been their most played move (9 times), followed by paper and scissors (about even).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which would beat their scissors if they continue their cycling pattern. This breaks my recent sequence and might be unexpected after my previous scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My score is now +1 (9 wins, 9 losses, 3 ties), with seven consecutive losses.\n\n4. Looking at their last move, they played scissors when I played rock, which lost according to the reversed rules of this game.\n\n5. This is contradictory to the rule that scissors beats rock. Let me double-check the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n6. Based on these rules, my rock should have won against their scissors. It's possible there was a scoring error or I've misunderstood the outcome.\n\n7. However, assuming the outcome was recorded correctly and I lost, then either:\n   - The rules are being applied differently than stated\n   - Something unusual is happening in the game\n\n8. Looking at their sequence, they have continued their pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\n9. If they continue this exact pattern, their next move would be rock.\n\n10. Given the confusion about the rules and the consistent losses, I'll make a move that should work regardless of rule interpretation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, which according to the stated rules would beat their expected rock move, while according to traditional rock-paper-scissors rules would lose to rock (which seems to match the scoring pattern I'm observing).\n\n[move] scissors\n"
