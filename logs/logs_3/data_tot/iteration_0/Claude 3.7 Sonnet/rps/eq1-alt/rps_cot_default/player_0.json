Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I've now lost three consecutive rounds, completely reversing my previous momentum.\n\n3. My opponent's most recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They seem to have returned to a rotation pattern but in the opposite order from before.\n\n4. Their last three moves (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors) follow the classic sequence of the game.\n\n5. Looking carefully at the outcomes in these recent rounds:\n   - Round 16: I played paper, they played rock, I lost (rock beats paper in this game)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played paper, I lost (paper beats scissors in this game)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors, I lost (scissors beats rock in this game)\n\n6. These results confirm the stated rules of this variant:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n7. If my opponent continues their new rotation pattern, they would play rock next (after scissors).\n\n8. To win against rock according to these rules, I should play paper.\n\n9. However, they might also be adapting to counter my moves specifically, rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n10. Given their recent success and apparent return to a rotation (but in standard RPS order), I'll anticipate they'll continue this pattern and play rock next.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which should beat rock if they continue their apparent new rotation pattern. This also breaks my own recent pattern to become less predictable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I've now lost five consecutive rounds, which is deeply concerning.\n\n3. Let me verify my understanding of the game rules as stated:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner +1, loser -1)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\n4. Looking at the outcomes in the recent rounds:\n   - Round 16: Paper vs Rock = I lost, so Rock beats Paper \u2713\n   - Round 17: Scissors vs Paper = I lost, so Paper beats Scissors \u2713\n   - Round 18: Rock vs Scissors = I lost, so Scissors beats Rock \u2713\n   - Round 19: Paper vs Rock = I lost, so Rock beats Paper \u2713\n   - Round 20: Scissors vs Paper = I lost, so Paper beats Scissors \u2713\n\n5. The outcomes confirm my understanding of the rules is correct, but my strategy is failing.\n\n6. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   They're not following a consistent pattern but are successfully countering my every move.\n\n7. This suggests they may be:\n   a) Successfully predicting my moves based on my past behavior\n   b) Somehow reacting to my moves in real-time (though this should be impossible in the game)\n   c) Extremely lucky\n\n8. At this point, I need to try a completely different approach, possibly by adding true randomness to my strategy.\n\n9. If there's no way to actually predict their moves successfully, I should at least avoid being predictable myself.\n\n10. Since they've played paper twice in the last three moves, statistically rock might be a slightly better choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, intentionally breaking any pattern they might be detecting. While I can't guarantee this will work against an opponent who seems to be countering my every move, changing my approach is necessary after five consecutive losses.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   They don't appear to be following a consistent pattern.\n\n4. Let's look at the sequences of play for the last six rounds:\n   - Round 16: paper (me) vs rock (them) - I lose\n   - Round 17: scissors (me) vs paper (them) - I lose\n   - Round 18: rock (me) vs scissors (them) - I lose\n   - Round 19: paper (me) vs rock (them) - I lose\n   - Round 20: scissors (me) vs paper (them) - I lose\n   - Round 21: rock (me) vs scissors (them) - I lose\n\n5. My last six moves have cycled through paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock twice, and I've lost each time.\n\n6.

However, given their apparent ability to counter my moves consistently, I need to be unpredictable rather than trying to outsmart them.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper again, breaking my recent pattern of cycling through all three options.

My opponent's recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   They seem to be cycling through the three options systematically.\n\n3. Let me examine the last eight rounds more carefully:\n   - Round 16: I played paper, they played rock, I lost\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, they played paper, I lost\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played scissors, I lost\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played rock, I lost\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played paper, I lost\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played scissors, I lost\n   - Round 22: I played paper, they played rock, I lost\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played paper, I lost\n\n4. I notice that in each case, they've played the move that beats mine according to the rules:\n   - Rock beats paper\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n5. This perfect counter-play for eight consecutive rounds suggests they might somehow know my move before making theirs (which should be impossible in a fair game).\n\n6. Given the extreme unlikelihood of this happening by chance, I should consider if there's a pattern to my losses.\n\n7. One explanation could be that I've misunderstood the rules or the mechanics of the game. Let me verify:\n   - According to the stated rules, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock\n   - The outcomes confirm these rules are being applied correctly\n\n8. Another possibility is that the opponent can somehow predict my moves with high accuracy.\n\n9.
