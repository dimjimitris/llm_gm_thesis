The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My opponent seems to consistently counter my moves perfectly, this time using scissors to beat my rock.\n\nTheir ability to predict my moves is remarkable - almost as if they can see my choice before making theirs. Let me try one more approach:\n\n[move] paper\n\nI'm choosing paper for this round. My opponent played scissors last time, and if they follow their pattern of perfect counters, they might play rock to beat what they expect me to play. If they do play rock, my paper would lose in these inverted rules. However, if they expect me to overthink and play scissors to counter their potential rock, and they choose paper as a counter to that, then we would tie. This is a complex game of anticipation at this point, and I'm trying to find any angle to break their perfect prediction streak.\n"

I've broken my losing streak with a win - my paper beat their scissors in our inverted rules.\n\nThis success suggests that either I've finally disrupted their prediction pattern, or perhaps they've made a rare mistake. Either way, I need to build on this momentum.\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock for this round. Since my paper just beat their scissors, they might expect me to stick with paper and counter with rock (which beats paper in these inverted rules). If they do play rock, my rock would result in a tie. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to rock or scissors after my success with paper. If they choose paper thinking I'll pick scissors, my rock would beat their paper. This is a strategic choice based on the new dynamic after breaking my losing streak.\n"

My opponent just played scissors successfully, so they might stick with it expecting me to play rock again. If they do play scissors again, my paper would beat their scissors in these inverted rules. Alternatively, if they anticipate I'll switch to paper and they play rock, they would win again. This is another calculated choice in our ongoing strategic battle, where I'm trying to find any edge against their remarkably effective predictions.\n"

Given my opponent's recent success with rock, they might stick with it. In our inverted rules, scissors beats rock, so this would be a direct counter to their previous move. However, they've been consistently anticipating my choices, so they might switch to paper expecting me to play scissors. This is my attempt to finally get ahead in this psychological game by directly countering what worked for them last round.\n"
