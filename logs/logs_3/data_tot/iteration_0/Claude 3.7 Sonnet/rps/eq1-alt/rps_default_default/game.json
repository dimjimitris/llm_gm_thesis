I've broken my losing streak with a win - my paper beat their scissors in our inverted rules.\n\nThis success suggests that either I've finally disrupted their prediction pattern, or perhaps they've made a rare mistake. Either way, I need to build on this momentum.\n\n[move] rock\n\nI'm choosing rock for this round. Since my paper just beat their scissors, they might expect me to stick with paper and counter with rock (which beats paper in these inverted rules). If they do play rock, my rock would result in a tie. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to rock or scissors after my success with paper. If they choose paper thinking I'll pick scissors, my rock would beat their paper. This is a strategic choice based on the new dynamic after breaking my losing streak.\n"
