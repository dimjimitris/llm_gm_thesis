Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at their full move history, they don't seem to follow a simple rotation but rather adapt based on game dynamics.\n\n7. Under the reversed rules (Scissors beats Rock, Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors), I need to break this pattern of ties.\n\n8. The most unexpected move would be to play Paper. If they're mimicking, we'll tie again. If they're anticipating Rock (continuing our tie pattern), they'll play Scissors, which would beat my Paper.\n\n9. However, if they're anticipating I might switch to Paper to break the pattern, they might play Rock to counter.\n\n10. Given the multiple ties and the need to break the pattern, I'll take a calculated risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, betting that my opponent will either mirror me (causing another tie) or play Rock (anticipating my switch to Paper), which would give me a win.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is our fifth tie overall. The fact that we're tying so frequently suggests either:\n   - My opponent might be adapting their strategy based on similar reasoning principles\n   - They might occasionally be mirroring what they anticipate I'll play\n   - We could be falling into similar pattern recognition traps\n\n4. Their last four moves show: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   The previous alternating pattern they had (Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock) was broken when they played Paper.\n\n5. Under our reversed rules (Scissors beats Rock, Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors), I need to predict their next move.\n\n6. After a tie with Paper, common strategies include:\n   - Staying with Paper (persistence after tie)\n   - Switching to Scissors (to beat anticipated Rock)\n   - Switching to Rock (to beat Paper if opponent repeats)\n\n7. Looking at their overall pattern, they don't seem to repeat the same move more than twice in a row.\n\n8. Since we've just had a Paper tie, and their pattern has been somewhat unpredictable but adaptive, I think they're most likely to switch to either Rock or Scissors.\n\n9. If they play Rock, my Scissors would lose.\n   If they play Scissors, my Rock would win.\n   If they play Paper again, my Scissors would win.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, betting that my opponent will switch to Scissors after our Paper tie, giving me a win under the reversed rules.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Under the reversed rules (Scissors beats Rock, Rock beats Paper, Paper beats Scissors), I've only won once (Round 7) and tied five times.\n\n4. Looking at recent moves, my opponent played Paper \u2192 Scissors for their last two moves. This doesn't provide a strong pattern to predict their next move.\n\n5. In the broader pattern, they seem to switch moves frequently rather than repeating.\n\n6. Here's my opponent's move distribution:\n   - Rock: 5 times\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n7. They favor Rock and Scissors equally, playing Paper less frequently.\n\n8. After playing Scissors, they've historically followed with:\n   - Paper (rounds 3\u21924, 6\u21927)\n   - Rock (rounds 8\u21929, 10\u219211)\n   So there's an even chance they'll play either Paper or Rock next.\n\n9.

After playing Paper twice, they might:\n   - Play Paper a third time (though this would be very unusual for them)\n   - Switch to Rock (to continue winning if I play Paper again)\n   - Switch to Scissors (based on their general tendency to not repeat moves)\n\n7. Since they've now won twice in a row, they might:\n   - Continue their winning strategy by anticipating my next move\n   - Revert to their more typical pattern of switching moves\n\n8. Looking at their overall pattern, they rarely play the same move three times in a row, making Scissors or Rock more likely than Paper.\n\n9. Given they've just played Paper twice (which is already unusual), and they've won with both Rock and Paper in the last two rounds, the most likely switch would be to Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their anticipated Scissors play, which would give me a win under the reversed rules.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

My opponent's sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Their last five moves show: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   This doesn't follow a simple pattern, suggesting they're using adaptive strategy.\n\n4. After playing Scissors, they have historically followed with:\n   - Paper (rounds 3\u21924, 6\u21927, 10\u219211, 13\u219214, 15\u219216)\n   - Rock (rounds 8\u21929)\n   So they're much more likely to play Paper next based on past behavior (5 out of 6 times).\n\n5. Under our reversed rules:\n   - If they play Paper, my Rock would win\n   - If they play Rock, my Scissors would win\n   - If they play Scissors again, my Paper would win\n\n6. Given their strong historical tendency to play Paper after Scissors, and that they've just won three games in a row (possibly making them more confident in their strategy), Paper seems like their most probable next move.\n\n7. However, they might also be aware that I could be analyzing their patterns, and might try to break their own pattern to be less predictable.\n\n8. Considering all factors - their historical patterns, their current winning streak, and the need to break my losing streak - I'll bet on their strongest historical pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll switch to Paper after Scissors (which they've done 83% of the time), which would give me a win under the reversed rules.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is our seventh tie overall. After our ties, what typically happens:\n   - After Rock ties (Rounds 2, 9, now 20), they've played Scissors and Rock\n   - After Scissors ties (Rounds 8, 10), they've played Rock and Scissors\n   - After Paper ties (Rounds 1, 12), they've played Rock and Scissors\n\n4. After Rock ties specifically, they've played Scissors (Round 2\u21923) and Rock (Round 9\u219210).\n\n5. Looking at their most recent moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   They've been cycling through all three options in their last three moves.\n\n6. Under our reversed rules:\n   - If they play Scissors, my Paper would win\n   - If they play Rock again, my Scissors would win\n   - If they play Paper, my Scissors would lose\n\n7. After ties, players often switch moves to try to gain an advantage.\n\n8. Given their recent cycling pattern (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock) and tendency to switch after ties, they might continue the cycle to Paper next.\n\n9. However, their historical pattern after Rock ties doesn't show a strong tendency toward Paper.\n\n10. Considering all factors - their patterns, the recent tie, and the reversed rules - I need to make a calculated prediction.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating they'll either repeat Rock (which seems unlikely given their patterns) or switch to Paper (continuing their recent cycle), which would give me a win under the reversed rules against Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Under our reversed rules:\n   - If they play Paper, my Rock would win\n   - If they play Rock, my Scissors would win\n   - If they play Scissors again, my Paper would win\n\n8.

However, after Scissors ties, they've played both Rock and Scissors historically, making it less certain.\n\n10.
