    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I correctly anticipated the pattern change! Let me continue my analysis.\n\nSteps:\n1. I played Scissors and my opponent played Scissors, resulting in a tie (0 points).\n2. Complete move history:\n   - Round 1: They played Rock, I played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 2: They played Scissors, I played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: They played Rock, I played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: They played Paper, I played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 5: They played Scissors, I played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: They played Rock, I played Paper (I lost)\n   - Round 8: They played Rock, I played Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 9: They played Scissors, I played Rock (I lost)\n   - Round 10: They played Scissors, I played Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 11: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 12: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: They played Paper, I played Paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: They played Paper, I played Scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 15: They played Rock, I played Rock (tie)\n   - Round 16: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 17: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 18: They played Scissors, I played Paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: They played Scissors, I played Scissors (tie)\n\n3. Their updated pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n\n4. They've now played Scissors four times in a row, which matches their longest previous streak of Scissors (rounds 9-12).\n\n5. After their previous 4-Scissors streak, they switched to Paper. This might suggest they'll switch to Paper again.\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After round 2 tie: they played Rock\n   - After round 3 tie: they played Paper\n   - After round 4 tie: they played Scissors\n   - After round 5 tie: they played Scissors\n   - After round 10 tie: they played Scissors\n   - After round 13 tie: they played Paper\n   - After round 15 tie: they played Scissors\n   - Now after round 19 tie: ?\n\n7. No clear pattern emerges after ties, though they've shown a tendency toward Scissors and occasional Rock.\n\n8. Considering their overall pattern and especially their behavior after a long streak, they're likely to switch moves now.\n\n9. If they switch to Paper (as they did after their last 4-Scissors streak), I should play Rock.\n10. If they switch to Rock (which they've played after ties before), I should play Paper.\n11. If they continue with Scissors, I should play Paper.\n\nFinal decision: Based on their historical pattern of switching to Paper after a long Scissors streak, I'll play Rock to counter their likely Paper move.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

There's no strong pattern after consecutive ties, though Paper and Scissors were favored.\n\n7. Considering their recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 ?\n   - After breaking a streak, they sometimes start a new streak (as they did with Paper after Scissors)\n   - They might play Rock again, or switch to Paper or Scissors\n\n8. If they play Rock again, I should play Paper (as Paper beats Rock).\n9. If they switch to Paper, I should play Rock (as Rock beats Paper).\n10. If they switch to Scissors, I should play Paper (as Paper beats Scissors).\n\n11. Analyzing their broader pattern:\n    - They often play Rock after Scissors\n    - They've shown a tendency to start streaks with the same move\n    - They just switched to Rock, which might indicate the start of a Rock streak\n\nFinal decision: Given their tendency to form streaks and the fact that Paper would win against both Rock and Scissors (their most likely moves), I'll play Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

After three consecutive ties:\n   - After rounds 3-4-5 (three ties): they played Scissors\n   - Now after rounds 19-20-21 (three ties): ?\n\n7.

After four consecutive ties:\n   - We now have four ties in a row (rounds 19-22)\n   - We've never had this many consecutive ties before\n   - They tend to break patterns after prolonged repetition\n\n7.

If they play Paper again, I should play Rock.\n9. If they switch to Rock, I should play Paper.\n10. If they switch to Scissors, I should play Paper.\n\n11. Given their history of playing moves in streaks of 2-4 rounds, and the fact we've had four consecutive ties, they're likely to break the pattern.\n\n12.
