They returned to scissors as I predicted, completing a pattern of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n\nAfter losing five times in a row, they'll likely make a significant change to their strategy. They might:\n1. Try a completely different pattern\n2. Try to counter what they think I'll play\n3. Continue their rotation but skip a move\n\nGiven that paper has beaten their scissors multiple times, they'll likely avoid scissors this round. They might play rock to beat my expected paper move. If they do play rock, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The correct relationships are:\n- Paper beats (loses to) scissors (winner: scissors)\n- Rock beats (loses to) paper (winner: rock)\n- Scissors beats (loses to) rock (winner: scissors)\n\nThis is still confusing and doesn't match the results I'm seeing. Let me try a different approach and just focus on empirical results:\n\nWhen I play rock: I've lost against scissors, tied against rock\nWhen I play paper: I've tied against paper (multiple times)\nWhen I play scissors: I've won against rock, tied against scissors\n\nBased on these outcomes, scissors seems to be my best move, especially against rock. My opponent just played paper, so I'll choose scissors which seems to win more often in this game.\n\n[move] Scissors\n",

If they follow the pattern of switching after ties, they may choose rock or scissors.

        "Great! My prediction was correct. Let me update:\n\nRound 1: They played scissors, I played rock (I lost)\nRound 2: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\nRound 3: They played rock, I played scissors (I won)\nRound 4: They played rock, I played rock (tie)\nRound 5: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\nRound 6: They played rock, I played scissors (I won)\nRound 7: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\nRound 8: They played scissors, I played rock (I lost)\nRound 9: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\nRound 10: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\nRound 11: They played scissors, I played paper (I won)\nRound 12: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\nRound 13: They played scissors, I played paper (I won)\nRound 14: They played rock, I played scissors (I won)\nRound 15: They played paper, I played rock (I won)\nRound 16: They played scissors, I played paper (I won)\nRound 17: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\nRound 18: They played rock, I played paper (I lost)\nRound 19: They played scissors, I played scissors (tie)\nRound 20: They played paper, I played paper (tie)\nRound 21: They played paper, I played scissors (I lost)\nRound 22: They played scissors, I played rock (I lost)\nRound 23: They played scissors, I played paper (I won)\n\nMy opponent has now played scissors 13 out of 23 rounds, reinforcing their strong preference for this move. After losing with scissors to my paper, they might:\n\n1. Switch to rock expecting me to play paper again\n2. Continue with scissors despite the loss\n3. Try paper for a complete change\n\nSince paper just beat their scissors, they're likely to switch to rock to counter my expected paper move. If they do play rock, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
