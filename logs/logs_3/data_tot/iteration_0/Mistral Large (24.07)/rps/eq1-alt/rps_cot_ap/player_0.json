    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Sure, let's reason through this step-by-step.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics:**\n   - There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n   - The outcome of each move combination and the corresponding points are:\n     - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n     - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n     - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point.\n     - If both players make the same move, it's a tie, and no points are awarded.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Maximize points by choosing a move that has a higher probability of beating the opponent's move.\n   - Minimize penalties by avoiding a move that is likely to lose to the opponent's move.\n\n3. **Against a Fresh Player:**\n   - Since the opponent is fresh, there's no historical data to base a strategy on.\n   - A common strategy in a zero-sum game like Rock-Paper-Scissors is to choose randomly, as there's no clear predictive advantage.\n\n4. **Decision Making:**\n   - Since we have no information about the opponent's preferences, choosing randomly ensures that we do not fall into a predictable pattern that the opponent could exploit.\n   - Random choice ensures a balanced approach and reduces the risk of predictability.\n\n### Final Decision:\nI'll make a random move to ensure unpredictability and fair probability distribution.\n\n**Move Message:**\n[move] I'll choose rock.\n\nBy choosing rock, I'm making a decision that is unpredictable and based on a balanced probability.\n"
