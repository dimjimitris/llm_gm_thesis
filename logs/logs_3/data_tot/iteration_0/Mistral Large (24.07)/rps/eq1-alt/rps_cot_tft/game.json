He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately.

        "To maximize my points in this round, I'll strategically consider the opponent's likely moves based on the previous rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Review Previous Rounds:**\n   - In the previous round, I won by choosing scissors against the opponent's rock.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Strategy:**\n   - The opponent might try to counter my previous winning move (scissors) by choosing rock again, anticipating that I might choose scissors once more.\n   - Alternatively, the opponent might choose paper to counter scissors, thinking that I will stick with the same move.\n\n3. **Consider Possible Outcomes:**\n   - If the opponent chooses rock to counter scissors, choosing paper would be a winning move.\n   - If the opponent chooses paper to counter scissors, choosing scissors would result in a loss.\n\n4. **Decision Based on Probability:**\n   - Given the opponent's possible moves (rock or paper), choosing paper maximizes the likelihood of winning. If the opponent chooses rock, I win. If the opponent chooses paper, it's a tie.\n   - Choosing scissors again would be risky as it could result in a loss if the opponent chooses rock.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Based on the opponent's likely moves to counter my scissors with rock or paper, I'll choose paper to maximize my chances of winning.) paper\n",
