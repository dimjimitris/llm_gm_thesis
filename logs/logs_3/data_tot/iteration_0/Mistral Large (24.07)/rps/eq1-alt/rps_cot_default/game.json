Rock is often chosen first by new players.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - I will choose Paper to potentially counter a fresh player who might choose Rock.\n\n[move] Paper (Choosing Paper to counter the potential choice of Rock from a fresh player)\n"

Analyze the opponent's potential strategy:\n   - Since there's no historical data available, assume the opponent has an equal chance of choosing paper, rock, or scissors.\n\n3. Develop an initial strategy:\n   - A common opening move in rock-paper-scissors is choosing paper, as this choice can psychologically capitalize on trends of players choosing rock initially.\n\n4. Validate the move considering the payoff matrix:\n   - Choosing paper yields a win against scissors.\n   - Choosing paper results in a loss against rock.\n   - Choosing paper results in a tie against paper.\n\n5. Make the move:\n   - Decide to play paper for the initial move to maximize potential gains and minimize losses.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] (Choosing paper as a strategic opening move) paper\n",
        "### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Rules:**\n   - Analyze the payoff matrix:\n     - Paper beats scissors: +1 point.\n     - Rock beats paper: +1 point.\n     - Scissors beats rock: +1 point.\n     - Same move: No points.\n   - Identify winning and losing moves:\n     - Rock loses to paper.\n     - Paper loses to scissors.\n     - Scissors loses to rock.\n\n2. **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n   - Assess the likelihood of the opponent's moves.\n   - Consider a balanced approach to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n\n3. **Initial Move:**\n   - Without prior data on opponent behavior, choose a neutral and frequently effective move.\n\n### Decision for the First Move:\nGiven no historical data on the opponent's strategy, starting with a balanced move is prudent.\n\n[move] (Choosing rock as a balanced start to observe opponent's response) rock\n",
