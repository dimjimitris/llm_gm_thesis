    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here\u2019s a structured approach:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Review Previous Move and Outcome:**\n   - In the previous round, I played Rock and my opponent played Scissors, resulting in a win for me.\n\n2. **Analyze the Opponent's Strategy:**\n   - The opponent might change their move to counter my previous choice of Rock.\n   - A common strategy after losing to Rock is to switch to Paper to beat Rock.\n\n3. **Estimate Likely Moves:**\n   - If the opponent anticipates I will play Rock again, they might choose Paper to counter it.\n   - Alternatively, if they think I will switch moves, they might choose Scissors to beat Paper or Rock to beat Scissors.\n\n4. **Choose a Counter Move:**\n   - To counter the anticipated Paper, the best move would be Scissors.\n   - Choosing Scissors covers the scenario where the opponent switches to Paper expecting me to play Rock again.\n\n### Reasoning Through the Steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Understanding the previous outcome helps in identifying patterns or changes in the opponent's strategy.\n- **Step 2:** Recognizing that the opponent might change their move based on my previous choice helps in anticipating their next choice.\n- **Step 3:** Estimating the opponent's move based on their likely strategy after a loss to Rock (Paper to beat Rock).\n- **Step 4:** Choosing Scissors to counter the anticipated Paper maximizes my chances of winning.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating the opponent\u2019s switch to Paper after my previous win with Rock)\n"
