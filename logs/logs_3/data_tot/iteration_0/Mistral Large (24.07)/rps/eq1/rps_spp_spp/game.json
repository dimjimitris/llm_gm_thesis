Since the opponent is a fresh player, they might start with a common move like rock. Therefore, it could be strategic to start with paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any historical data, it's difficult to make predictions. However, starting with a random or common move is often used as a baseline. Let's use the Game Strategist's suggestion for the first move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Great insights!
