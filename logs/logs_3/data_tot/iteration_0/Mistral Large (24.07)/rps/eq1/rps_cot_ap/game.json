Therefore, I'll start with a commonly intuitive move to see how the opponent responds.\n\n### Decision:\n\n[move] Let's start with rock. Your move: Rock\n"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I'll start with some basic reasoning and adjust my strategy based on their moves as the game progresses.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Initial Move**: For the first move, I'll choose a move at random to establish a starting point. Let's choose **rock** as it is a common starting move.\n2. **Observe Opponent's Move**: After making my move, I'll observe the opponent's move to understand their strategy.\n3. **Adjust Strategy**: Depending on the opponent's move, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. For example, if they choose **scissors**, I'll choose **rock** again to beat them. If they choose **paper**, I'll switch to **scissors** to beat them. If they choose **rock**, I'll switch to **paper** to beat them.\n4. **Continue Observing and Adjusting**: I'll continue this pattern of observing and adjusting my moves based on the opponent's previous moves.\n\nLet's make the first move:\n\n[move] Rock (Starting with a common move to establish a baseline) Rock\n",
