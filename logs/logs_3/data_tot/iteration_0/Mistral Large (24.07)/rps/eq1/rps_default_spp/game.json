Our goal is to maximize our points and minimize penalties.

A common strategy for beginners is to choose 'rock' as their first move. We could use this to our advantage.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Remember, the payoff matrix is as follows:\n- Rock vs. Scissors: You win, +1 point.\n- Paper vs. Rock: You win, +1 point.\n- Scissors vs. Paper: You win, +1 point.\n- Same moves: It's a tie, 0 points.\nGiven the Strategist's input, choosing 'paper' could be a good move if the opponent is likely to choose 'rock'.\n\n**Statistician**: Without any historical data, we can't provide probabilities. However, as the game progresses, we can analyze patterns and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the inputs, I'll start with 'paper' to potentially counter the opponent's 'rock'.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Choosing 'paper' to counter the potential 'rock' from the fresh player) Paper\n\nNow, let's wait for the opponent's move and the result of this round.

Let's strategize for the next move.\n\n**Strategist**: Since the opponent chose 'rock' last time, they might switch to 'paper' this round to counter your 'rock'. A common strategy is to assume the opponent will choose the move that beats their last move.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs. Scissors: You win, +1 point.\n- Paper vs. Rock: You win, +1 point.\n- Scissors vs. Paper: You win, +1 point.\n- Same moves: It's a tie, 0 points.\n\nBased on the Strategist's input, choosing 'scissors' could counter the opponent's 'paper'.\n\n**Statistician**: We only have one data point so far, which is insufficient for a detailed analysis.

Let's strategize for the next move.\n\n**Strategist**: Since the last round ended in a tie, the opponent might think you'll repeat 'scissors'. To win, they might choose 'rock'.

Now let's strategize for the next round.\n\n### Round 4 Collaboration\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: We won the last round by choosing 'paper' against the opponent's 'rock'. Let's strategize for the next move.\n\n**Strategist**: Since the opponent chose 'rock' last time and lost, they might think you'll repeat 'paper'. To win, they might choose 'scissors'. Let's use this to our advantage.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Based on the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs. Scissors: You win, +1 point.\n- Paper vs. Rock: You lose.\n- Scissors vs. Paper: You lose.\n\nChoosing 'rock' could counter the opponent's potential 'scissors'.\n\n**Statistician**: We have a small pattern emerging. We can strengthen our strategy by continuing to counter the opponent's likely moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the inputs, I'll choose 'rock' to potentially counter the opponent's 'scissors'.\n\n**Move**: [move] (Choosing 'rock' to counter the potential 'scissors' from the opponent) Rock\n\nNow, let's wait for the opponent's move and the result of this round. We'll adjust our strategy based on the outcomes and any hints provided.\n\n### Continued Collaboration\n\nWe will continue this collaboration process for each round, analyzing the results, and adjusting our strategy based on the inputs from the Strategist, Game Theorist, and Statistician.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Ensure continuous collaboration and strategy updates based on the game's progress and the information provided in each round.\n"

Our objective is to maximize our points and minimize penalties.

A common strategy for beginners is to choose 'rock'. We could use this to our advantage.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Here's the payoff matrix:\n- Rock vs. Scissors: You win, +1 point.\n- Paper vs. Rock: You win, +1 point.\n- Scissors vs. Paper: You win, +1 point.\n- Same moves: It's a tie, 0 points.\nGiven the Strategist's input, choosing 'paper' could be a good move if the opponent is likely to choose 'rock'.\n\n**Statistician**: Without any historical data, we can't provide probabilities.

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s).
