He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3.

This way, it's harder for the opponent to predict.\n\n4. **Consider the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Rock, Paper, and Scissors each have an equal chance of winning or losing against the others.\n\n5. **Make a Decision**:\n   - Given the lack of information, any move could be equally effective.

        "### Steps to Maximize Points in This Round:\n\n1. **Review Previous Rounds:**\n   - Last move: Rock.\n   - Opponent's move: Scissors.\n   - Result: Won the round and scored 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Potential Move:**\n   - The opponent lost with Scissors and might switch to a move that beats Rock, which is Paper.\n   - Alternatively, the opponent might choose Rock, thinking I will switch to Paper.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 point for Rock, -1 point for Scissors).\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 point for Paper, -1 point for Rock).\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 point for Scissors, -1 point for Paper).\n   - Tie if both players make the same move (no points awarded).\n\n4. **Formulate a Strategy:**\n   - Given the likelihood that the opponent might switch to Paper to counter Rock, choosing Scissors could be a strategic move.\n   - This will either result in a win (if the opponent chooses Paper) or a tie (if the opponent also chooses Scissors, though this is less likely as they just lost with Scissors).\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- If the opponent chooses Paper, choosing Scissors will give me 1 point.\n- If the opponent chooses Scissors again (less likely), choosing Scissors will result in a tie, with no points awarded or deducted.\n- If the opponent chooses Rock, choosing Scissors will result in a loss, giving me -1 point (less likely as I just won with Rock).\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Choosing Scissors to potentially counter the opponent's Paper, which they might choose after losing with Scissors.) Scissors\n\nThis concludes the decision-making process for this round.\n",
