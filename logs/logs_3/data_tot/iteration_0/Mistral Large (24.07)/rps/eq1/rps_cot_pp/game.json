Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "### Steps to Win Rock-Paper-Scissors Game\n\n1. **Identify the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Paper beats Rock: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser.\n   - Ties result in no points.\n\n2. **Initial Strategy Formulation:**\n   - Since it's a fresh player, they might not have a predictable pattern yet.\n   - Start with a balanced approach: Use each move (rock, paper, scissors) approximately equally to understand the opponent\u2019s play style.\n\n3. **Observe and Adapt:**\n   - Notice if the opponent tends to repeat a move or follows a pattern.\n   - Look for any sequences or common behaviors (e.g., alternating moves, repeating a winning move).\n\n4. **Exploit Patterns:**\n   - If a pattern is detected, counter their move.\n   - Example: If the opponent plays \u201cRock\u201d often, choose \u201cPaper\u201d to maximize points.\n\n5. **Randomization and Variation:**\n   - To prevent the opponent from predicting your moves, occasionally break your own patterns.\n   - Use a semi-random strategy to keep the opponent guessing.\n\n### Making the First Move\nGiven that this is the first move against an unknown opponent, it's best to start with a random choice to see how they respond.\n\n[move] Paper (Starting with a random move to gauge the opponent's strategy.) Your move here\n\n### Final Decision: Paper\nThis initial move will help in understanding the opponent\u2019s first choice and formulating a strategy for the subsequent rounds based on their response.\n",

Let's start with \"rock\".\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- Without any prior information on the opponent's behavior, selecting any move has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n- If I choose \"rock\", it could win against \"scissors\", lose to \"paper\", or tie with \"rock\".\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] rock\n- Since this is the first round, choosing any move arbitrarily is the starting point.\n",
