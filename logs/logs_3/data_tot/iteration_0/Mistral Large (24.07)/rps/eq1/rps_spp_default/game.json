Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

        "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Strategist; Opponent Analyst\n\nLet's begin the collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, each move has a deterministic outcome against the others. Since you're playing against a fresh player, there's no historical moves to analyze yet. A good starting strategy might be to choose randomly or to start with a move that you believe is least likely to be chosen by the opponent.\n\nOpponent Analyst: Given that the player is fresh, we don't have any patterns to discern yet. A reasonable starting point might be to observe if they tend to pick a move more frequently. For now, let's assume they might start with a common or neutral move like \"rock.\"\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the initial analysis, let's start with a move that can counter a likely neutral or common choice from a fresh player.\n\nMove message:\n[move] (Choosing \"paper\" to counter the potential \"rock\") paper\n\nPlease provide any hints or the next move information.\n",

Since this is a fresh player, we have no past data to analyze yet. We should start with a move and adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response.\n\n**Statistician**: Given that there is no historical data, starting with a neutral move like 'rock' can be a balanced choice. It gives us a basis to see how the opponent reacts.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Based on the insights from the Strategist and Statistician, let's start with 'rock'.\n\n[move] Rock (First move to determine opponent's strategy)\n\n**Game Strategist**: Great choice. Now, let's see how the opponent responds and adjust our next move accordingly. If the opponent chooses 'paper', we should consider changing our strategy to counter that in the next round.\n\n**Statistician**: Once we have the opponent's response, we can start to build a pattern and make more informed choices. If the opponent consistently chooses the same move, we can adapt to predict and counter their choices.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Understood.

Since this is a fresh player you're playing against, it's important to start with a balanced approach. Rock-paper-scissors is often about understanding your opponent's tendencies and adapting your strategy accordingly. Initially, it might be wise to play a neutral move to see how the opponent responds.\n\n**Pattern Analyst**: As this is the first round, we don't have any previous data to analyze patterns. However, it's a good idea to start with a common initial move. Many players tend to start with rock, so playing paper could be a strategic first move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thank you for your insights. Given that it's a fresh player and without any established patterns, I'll go with paper as the initial move to possibly counter the common tendency of starting with rock.\n\n[move] (Starting with a neutral move to understand the opponent's tendency) Paper\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and observe the outcome before deciding the next steps.\n",
