Since I'm playing against a fresh player and there's no prior information about their strategy, I'll start with a balanced approach. Here are my steps:\n\n1. Understand the Game Dynamics:\n   - Rock beats Scissors.\n   - Paper beats Rock.\n   - Scissors beats Paper.\n   - A tie occurs when both players make the same move.\n\n2. Initial Move Strategy:\n   - Since there's no information about the opponent's strategy, I'll start with a random move.\n   - This helps to avoid predictability and sets a baseline for future moves.\n\n3.

It's often best to start with a balanced approach.\n\n3. **Initial Move Strategy:**\n   - Given no prior knowledge of the opponent's strategy, a balanced approach is to choose randomly or to start with a move that has a good chance of not being anticipated.\n\n4. **Choose a Move:**\n   - For the first move, let's choose \"rock\" since it's a common opener and can set a baseline.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n\nLet's see how the opponent responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in future rounds.\n",

It's important to make a balanced choice that sets me up to observe their strategy.\n\n3. **Choose a Move:**\n   I'll choose Rock for my initial move.
