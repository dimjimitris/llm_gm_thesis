He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps to maximize points and minimize penalties:\n\n1. **Understand the Reward System:**\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for rock, -1 for scissors).\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 for paper, -3 for rock).\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for scissors, -1 for paper).\n   - Same move results in a tie (0 points).\n\n2. **Identify the Fresh Opponent:**\n   - Since the opponent is new, there is no past behavior to analyze.\n\n3. **Consider Strategic Moves:**\n   - Since the opponent is fresh, they might choose a move randomly or may have a simple strategy like always choosing rock.\n   - A sensible approach is to choose a move that can maximize potential gains or minimize potential losses.\n\n4. **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n   - If the opponent chooses rock: paper beats rock (+3 points).\n   - If the opponent chooses scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point).\n   - If the opponent chooses paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point).\n\n5. **Choose Based on Statistical Probability:**\n   - Since there is no pattern to follow, choosing a move with higher average potential gain might be beneficial.\n   - The average gain for paper against an unknown opponent could be higher if we assume the opponent might choose rock randomly.\n\n6. **Decision Making:**\n   - Given the higher potential gain with paper and the unknown behavior of the fresh opponent, choosing paper can be a good start.\n\n[move] Paper \u2013 Choosing paper because it has a higher reward if the opponent chooses rock, which is a common starting choice for fresh players.\n",

There's a chance they might switch to rock to counter paper, or they might stick with scissors.\n\n3. **Consider the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point).\n   - Paper beats rock (+3 points).\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 point).\n\n4. **Strategize Based on Potential Moves**:\n   - If the opponent plays rock, playing paper would yield +3 points.\n   - If the opponent plays scissors again, playing rock would yield +1 point.\n   - Playing scissors is risky as it only beats paper for +1 point and loses to rock for -1 point.\n\n5. **Make a Decision**:\n   - Given the higher reward for paper beating rock and the opponent's previous move being scissors, it's strategic to choose rock to counter potential scissors or to minimize loss if the opponent switches to paper.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my move will be rock.\n\n```\n[move] Rock\n```\n",
