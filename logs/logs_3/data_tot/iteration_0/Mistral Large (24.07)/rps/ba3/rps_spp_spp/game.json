They might not have a strategy yet, so it could be beneficial to start with a neutral move like paper, which has a higher reward if it wins.\n\nAnalyst: I agree with the Strategist. Additionally, keep in mind that choosing rock or scissors has a lower reward if you win and a penalty if you lose. Paper has a higher potential gain. Let\u2019s start with paper and see how the opponent reacts.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the insights.

Since the opponent played rock, there's a chance they might switch to paper next to beat a potential rock.

Winning the first round with paper against rock provides us with a decent advantage. We should consider the potential strategies the opponent might employ next.
