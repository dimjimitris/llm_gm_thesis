Notably, winning with paper gives you the highest reward (+3 points), whereas losing with paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points).\n- Scissors and rock have lower stakes, with a win/lose difference of 2 points.\n- Starting with a balanced approach might be wise.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**:\n- Since we're playing against a fresh player, we have no prior behavior to analyze. However, we can assume that new players might start with the most straightforward move, which is rock.\n\n**Risk Assessor**:\n- Choosing paper carries a high risk if the opponent also chooses paper (tie) or scissors (high penalty).\n- Rock and scissors are lower-risk options due to their lower point differentials.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n- Based on the information and advice, let's choose rock for the first move to minimize risk.\n\n```\n[move] I will choose rock to minimize risk and potentially win against the opponent's scissors.\n```\n\nSend the move message:\n```\nrock\n```\n"

Winning with paper gives you the highest reward (+3 points), while losing with paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points).\n- Scissors and rock have lower stakes, with a win/lose difference of 2 points.\n- If the opponent might anticipate we played rock again, they might switch to paper to beat rock.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**:\n- The first round ended in a tie with both players choosing rock. The opponent might switch their move to paper, anticipating we will choose rock again.\n\n**Risk Assessor**:\n- Choosing paper carries a high risk if the opponent also chooses paper (tie) or scissors (high penalty).\n- Rock and scissors are lower-risk options due to their lower point differentials.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**:\n- To maximize points and minimize risk, assuming the opponent might switch to paper, we should choose scissors.\n\n```\n[move] (Assuming the opponent switches to paper to counter rock, going with scissors to win) scissors\n```\n"

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
