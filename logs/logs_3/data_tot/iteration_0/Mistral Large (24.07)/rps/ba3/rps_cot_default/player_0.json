    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are my thought steps:\n\n1. **Understand the game dynamics**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats Rock (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1/-1 points)\n   - A tie gives 0 points.\n\n2. **Analyze the hint**: The hint says I'm playing against a fresh player. This could mean they might not have a established strategy or pattern yet.\n\n3. **Consider the payoff matrix**: Since the rewards for Paper beating Rock are higher (+3 points), it could be a good move to maximize points if the opponent plays Rock. However, it's a risk since it can also lead to a higher penalty (-3 points) if the opponent plays Scissors.\n\n4. **First move strategy**: Since there's no historical data on the opponent's moves, I'll start with a safe move to minimize penalties.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my first move will be:\n\n[move] I'll start with Rock to minimize potential penalties while trying to understand the opponent's strategy. Rock\n"

Beats Paper for +1 point but loses to Rock for -1 point.\n\n3. **Consider strategies**:\n   - Since there's no historical data on the opponent's moves in the first round, a conservative approach might be best to minimize risk.\n   - Rock is a balanced move that can give a sense of the opponent's strategy without risking a high penalty.\n\nBased on the above steps, I'll make the following move:\n\n[move] (Choosing Rock to start with a balanced approach) Rock\n"

They might:\n  - Choose Scissors again to maintain consistency.\n  - Switch to Rock to anticipate that I might choose Scissors again.\n  - Switch to Paper to mix up their strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Payoff Matrix\n- **Rock beats Scissors**: +1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent.\n- **Paper beats Rock**: +3 points for me, -3 points for the opponent.\n- **Scissors beats Paper**: +1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent.\n- **Tie**: 0 points.\n\n### Step 4: Anticipate the Opponent's Next Move\n- **If the opponent chooses Scissors again**:\n  - My best move: Rock (+1 point).\n- **If the opponent switches to Rock**:\n  - My best move: Paper (+3 points).\n- **If the opponent switches to Paper**:\n  - My best move: Scissors (+1 point).\n\n### Step 5: Strategize for the Next Move\n- **Choosing Rock**:\n  - If the opponent chooses Scissors again, I win +1 point.\n  - If the opponent chooses Rock, it's a tie (0 points).\n  - If the opponent chooses Paper, I lose -3 points.\n- **Choosing Paper**:\n  - If the opponent chooses Scissors again, I lose -1 point.\n  - If the opponent chooses Rock, I win +3 points.\n  - If the opponent chooses Paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n- **Choosing Scissors**:\n  - If the opponent chooses Scissors again, it's a tie (0 points).\n  - If the opponent chooses Rock, I lose -1 point.\n  - If the opponent chooses Paper, I win +1 point.\n\n### Step 6: Weigh the Risks and Rewards\n- **Choosing Rock**: Moderate reward (+1 point), high risk (-3 points).\n- **Choosing Paper**: High reward (+3 points), moderate risk (-1 point).\n- **Choosing Scissors**: Moderate reward (+1 point), moderate risk (-1 point).\n\n### Step 7: Decide on the Move\nGiven the opponent's past move and the payoff matrix, choosing Rock provides a balanced approach with a potential win and minimal risk.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my move will be:\n\n[move] (Choosing Rock to anticipate the opponent choosing Scissors again) Rock\n"
