    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

A balanced approach can be taken by starting with a random move or a move that usually fares well in initial rounds.\n\n3. **Consider Potential Moves:**\n   - **Paper:** Beats scissors, loses to rock.\n   - **Rock:** Beats paper, loses to scissors.\n   - **Scissors:** Beats rock, loses to paper.\n\n4. **Choose a Balanced Move:**\n   - Starting with paper can be a balanced choice because it has a medium reward/ penalty balance (1/-1) compared to rock (3/-3) and scissors (1/-1).\n\n### Reasoning Through Steps:\n\n1. **Analyzing the Payoffs:**\n   - Paper versus scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock versus paper: +3/-3\n   - Scissors versus rock: +1/-1\n\n2. **Balanced Initial Strategy:**\n   - Since the other player is fresh, there is no past behavior to predict.\n   - A balanced approach with the paper move can help gauge the opponent's strategy without risking high penalties.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The initial move will be paper to start with a balanced and less risky approach.\n\n### Final Move:\n\n[move] Paper (Starting with a balanced and less risky move to gauge the opponent's strategy.)\n\nFinal decision: Paper\n"
