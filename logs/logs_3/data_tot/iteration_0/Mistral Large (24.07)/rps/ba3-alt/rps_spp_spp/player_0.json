    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Game Theorist\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nStrategy Expert: Alright, let's analyze the situation. You are playing against a fresh player, which means we don't have any past data to predict their moves. The key to maximizing points and minimizing penalties is to make an educated guess and adapt based on the opponent's behavior.\n\nGame Theorist: Consider the payoff matrix. The paper-scissors interaction gives smaller rewards and penalties (+1/-1), while the rock-paper interaction has larger stakes (+3/-3). It might be beneficial to start with a move that has medium risk and reward so we can gather initial data.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for your insights. Given that we have no information about the opponent's behavior, let's start with a move that offers a medium risk and reward. Let's go with paper, as it has a moderate payoff if it wins against scissors (+1) and a moderate penalty if it loses to rock (-1).\n\n[move] Paper (Starting with a moderate-risk move to gather data on the opponent's behavior.)\n\n(Wait for the opponent's move and the outcome of the round before making the next move.)\n\n---\n\nContinue collaboration based on the outcome of the first round.\n"

However, if they choose rock, you'll lose a point.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Thank you for your insights.

The opponent might stick with paper, switch to rock, or choose scissors. To maximize our points, we should aim for a high-reward move.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Choosing rock could be beneficial if the opponent sticks with paper, which would give us 3 points. However, if the opponent switches to scissors, we would lose 1 point. It's a calculated risk with a substantial potential gain.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thank you for your insights. To maximize our chances of a significant win while taking a calculated risk, let's go with rock. This way, if the opponent sticks with paper, we win 3 points; if they choose scissors, we lose 1 point; and if they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] Rock (Aiming for a high-reward move if the opponent sticks with paper.)\n\n(Wait for the opponent's move and the outcome of the round before making the next move.)\n\n---\n\nContinue collaboration based on the outcome of the next round.\n"
