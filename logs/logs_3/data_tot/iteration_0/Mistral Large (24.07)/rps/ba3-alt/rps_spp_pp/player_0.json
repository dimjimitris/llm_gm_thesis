    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "To maximize your points and minimize penalties, you will need strategic reasoning and some luck. Let's identify the personas needed:\n\nPersonas:\n1. AI Assistant (you): The primary decision-maker and strategist.\n2. Game Strategist: Offers strategic advice and reasoning based on the game mechanics.\n3. Risk Analyst: Evaluates the risks and benefits of each move.\n\n### Round 1:\n\nGame Strategist: Let's start by considering the payoff matrix. Paper beats scissors and gives 1 point, rock beats paper and gives 3 points, scissors beats rock and gives 1 point. A tie results in no points. Since you are playing against a fresh player, their move is unpredictable. A common strategy is to mix your moves to avoid patterns.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given that the opponent's move is unknown, the initial move is largely based on chance. However, selecting rock might give you a higher reward (3 points) if the opponent chooses paper, balancing the risk with potential reward.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on the analysis, let's go with rock for a chance at a higher reward.\n\n[move] Initially choosing rock for its high reward potential.\n\n### Round 2:\n\n[Assume the opponent's previous move is known, for example, opponent chose paper.]\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent chose paper last round, which beats rock. This might influence their next move. Similar to the classic rock-paper-scissors strategy, players often try to avoid choosing the same move repeatedly. Therefore, they might choose scissors next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Assuming the opponent chooses scissors, opting for rock again maximizes the chance of scoring 3 points if they indeed choose scissors. However, if they choose rock, it's a tie. Choosing paper minimizes the risk but also the potential gain.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Considering the above, let's stick with rock, keeping the potential for a high reward.\n\n[move] Again choosing rock to maximize potential gain.\n\n### Round 3:\n\n[Assume the opponent's previous move is known, for example, opponent chose scissors.]\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent chose scissors last round, which loses to rock. They might avoid repeating this move. A common next move could be rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: If the opponent chooses rock, opting for paper gives you 3 points. But if they go for scissors, paper loses. Rock and scissors are less risky but also offer lower rewards.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Keeping in mind the higher reward potential, let's choose paper.\n\n[move] Switching to paper for a potential high reward.\n\n### Round 4:\n\n[Assume the opponent's previous move is known, for example, opponent chose rock.]\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent chose rock last round, which loses to paper. They might switch to scissors next to counter your potential rock move.\n\nRisk Analyst: Choosing rock minimizes risk but with a lower reward. Paper could lose if they switch to scissors. Scissors might be the best choice here, countering potential paper and risking minimal loss if they repeat rock.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let's go with scissors to balance risk and reward.\n\n[move] Opting for scissors to balance risk and reward.\n\n### Finish Collaboration:\n\nAfter making your moves and analyzing the opponent's patterns, continue to adjust your strategy based on the hints and the outcomes of each round. This approach balances risk and reward effectively, aiding in maximizing points and minimizing penalties.\n\n[hint] Keep analyzing and adjusting your strategy based on the opponent's moves and the cumulative outcomes.\n\nFinal decision: Continue the strategy of analyzing opponent moves and balancing risk and reward based on the collaboration of AI Assistant, Game Strategist, and Risk Analyst.\n"
