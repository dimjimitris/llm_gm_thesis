'Paper' is a good choice because it can either win 1 point or tie (0 points), but it can't lose heavily (-3 points) like 'rock' can.\n\n2. **Observer Opponent's Move**: After the first move, I'll observe the opponent's move to gather information about their strategy.\n\n3. **Adapt Strategy**: Based on the opponent's moves, I'll adapt my strategy. For example:\n   - If the opponent played 'rock', they might be aiming for a big win. I should be cautious and consider playing 'paper' again to avoid a big loss.\n   - If the opponent played 'scissors', they might be aiming for a small win. I could play 'rock' to beat their 'scissors'.\n   - If the opponent played 'paper', they might be playing safe like me.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This suggests the opponent might exploit 'paper' again.\n2. **Analyze Potential Moves**:\n   - If I play 'rock', and the opponent plays 'paper', I could gain 3 points.\n   - If I play 'scissors', it beats 'paper' but loses to 'rock'. Given the opponent played 'rock' last time, this is risky.\n   - 'Paper' is likely to be countered again since it just lost to 'rock'.\n3. **Optimize Strategy**: Given the above risks, playing 'rock' seems optimal. It counters 'scissors' and ties with 'rock', but most importantly, it could beat 'paper' for a significant gain.\n\n[move] (Switching to 'rock' to potentially counter opponent's strategy and secure a win) rock\n",
        "[move] (Based on the previous round where the opponent chose 'rock', I'll play 'paper' again. Although it resulted in a loss last time, it minimizes the risk of a high penalty loss of -3 points and might catch the opponent off guard if they switch to 'scissors'.) paper\n",

However, my opponent might anticipate this and switch to 'scissors'.\n4. **Decide on the Move**: Playing 'scissors' is risky because if the opponent plays 'rock' again, I'll lose points.

Since the opponent played 'rock' last time, they might try something different this time.\n\n3. **Strategize Next Move**: To counter a potential change from the opponent, I could play defensively to minimize penalties or offensively to potentially score points.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Since losses with 'rock' are heavier (-3 points), it is less risky to aim for a smaller win. Playing 'scissors' can either win 1 point if the opponent plays 'paper', or lose 1 point if they play 'rock', which is a smaller penalty compared to 'rock' vs. 'paper'.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to potentially gain 1 point if the opponent plays paper and minimize risk) scissors\n",

Alternatively, they might switch to 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.\n3. **Minimize Risk**: To minimize risk, I should avoid playing 'paper' again as it could lead to another large loss if the opponent plays 'rock'.\n4. **Choose Move**: Playing 'scissors' is risky if the opponent plays 'rock'. Therefore, playing 'rock' is a safer choice as it can either tie (if the opponent plays 'rock') or win 1 point (if the opponent plays 'scissors').\n\n[move] (Playing rock to minimize risk and potentially win 1 point) rock\n"

        "To maximize points and minimize penalties, let's break down the thought process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Review Previous Rounds**: Understand the outcomes of previous rounds to identify any patterns or tendencies of the opponent.\n\n    - Last round, I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'rock'. I won with 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Strategy**: If the opponent plays 'rock' frequently, they might continue with it or switch. It's important to consider the possibility of them playing defensively or offensively.\n\n3. **Strategize Next Move**:\n   - If the opponent tends to play 'rock', playing 'paper' would be risky (big penalty), and playing 'scissors' again could be a safe bet (potential win).\n   - If the opponent might switch to 'paper' for a safer play, playing 'scissors' could win 1 point.\n   - If the opponent switches to 'scissors', playing 'rock' would be beneficial.\n\n4. **Risk Management**:\n   - Playing 'paper' has a high risk due to a potential -3 penalty.\n   - Playing 'scissors' is a safer option with a potential win or a minimal loss.\n   - Playing 'rock' can counter 'scissors' but might result in a tie if the opponent also plays 'rock'.\n\nGiven these considerations, playing 'scissors' again is a balanced move. It provides a chance to win if the opponent plays 'rock' or 'paper', and minimizes the risk of a big loss.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to maintain a balanced strategy and minimize risk) scissors\n",
        "Let's strategize for the next move, considering the results and patterns so far:\n\n1. **Review Previous Moves**:\n   - I played paper twice and lost to rock both times.\n   - I played scissors last time and won against rock.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Strategy**:\n   - The opponent has played rock in all rounds so far. This could either be a pattern or a strategic choice.\n\n3. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes**:\n   - If the opponent plays rock again, playing paper will result in a significant loss (-3 points).\n   - If the opponent plays rock again, playing scissors will result in a win (1 point).\n   - If the opponent changes their strategy, playing scissors could either result in a tie (0 points) if they play scissors, or a loss (-1 point) if they play paper.\n\n4. **Risk Management**:\n   - Given the opponent's track record of playing rock, playing scissors again seems like the best move to maximize points while minimizing the risk of a large penalty.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors again to counter the opponent's potential continuous use of rock) scissors\n",

After losing to 'scissors', they might play 'paper' to counter 'rock', aiming for a big win or avoiding another loss to 'scissors'.\n\n3. **Strategize Next Move**:\n   - If the opponent plays 'paper', playing 'scissors' would lose 1 point.\n   - If the opponent plays 'rock', playing 'paper' would win 3 points.\n   - If the opponent plays 'scissors', playing 'rock' would win 1 point.\n\n   Given the past move, I should anticipate a shift towards 'paper'. Playing 'scissors' is a cautious move to avoid a large penalty, but could limit potential gains.\n\n4. **Optimal Move**: To potentially win more points, playing 'paper' against a possible 'rock' from the opponent could maximize the win. However, if the opponent plays 'scissors', I might lose 1 point.\n\n[move] (Playing paper to potentially win 3 points if the opponent plays rock, but cautious as it might lose 1 point against scissors) paper\n"
