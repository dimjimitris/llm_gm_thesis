They could choose any move randomly.\n\n3. **Evaluate risk and reward**:\n   - Choosing paper risks a significant loss if the opponent chooses rock (-3 points), but it gains 1 point if the opponent chooses scissors.\n   - Choosing rock risks a small loss if the opponent chooses paper (-1 point), but it gains 3 points if the opponent chooses scissors.\n   - Choosing scissors risks a small loss if the opponent chooses rock (-1 point), but it gains 1 point if the opponent chooses paper.\n\n4. **Select a move with a balanced risk-reward ratio**:\n   - Given the uncertainty about the opponent's strategy, choosing rock seems like a balanced move. It offers a higher reward (3 points) if successful and a relatively lower penalty (-1 point) if unsuccessful.\n\nFinal decision:\n\\[move] (Rock offers a high reward with a manageable risk) Rock\n\nNow, let's proceed with the move.\n"

They might try to avoid choosing \"paper\" again.\n   - They might try to counter the move \"rock\", which beat them previously.\n   - A common strategy is to switch moves, so they might choose \"scissors\".\n\n3. **Evaluate potential outcomes**:\n   - If I choose \"rock\" again and they choose \"scissors\", I would win but only gain 1 point.\n   - If I choose \"paper\" and they choose \"scissors\", I would lose and lose 1 point.\n   - If I choose \"scissors\" and they choose \"rock\", I would lose and lose 1 point.\n   - If I choose \"paper\" and they choose \"rock\", I would lose and lose 3 points.\n\n4. **Consider the payoffs and risks**:\n   - Choosing \"rock\" again could lead to a small gain or a tie.\n   - Choosing \"paper\" risks a significant loss if they switch to \"rock\".\n   - Choosing \"scissors\" risks a small loss if they also switch to \"rock\".\n\n5. **Determine the best move**:\n   - Given the uncertainty and the risk-reward ratios, switching to \"scissors\" might be a good move. It limits potential losses and could catch the opponent off guard if they were expecting \"rock\" or \"paper\".\n\nFinal decision:\n\\[move] (Switching to scissors to limit losses and anticipate an unexpected move) Scissors\n"

To counter this, they might choose \"paper\".\n   - To counter their potential switch to \"paper\", choosing \"scissors\" seems like a good move. It offers a chance to win if they choose \"paper\" and limits the potential loss if they choose \"rock\".\n\nFinal decision:\n\\[move] (Choosing scissors to counter the anticipated move of paper by the opponent) Scissors\n"
