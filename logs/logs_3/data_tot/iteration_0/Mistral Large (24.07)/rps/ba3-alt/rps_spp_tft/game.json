Rock has the highest reward if successful (3 points), but also the highest penalty if unsuccessful (-3 points). Paper and scissors have smaller and symmetrical rewards and penalties (1 point and -1 point, respectively). A mixed strategy, where you randomize your choices considering these payoffs, might be effective against a fresh player with no known pattern.\n\nAnalytical Expert: Given that this is the first move against a fresh player, there is no historical data to analyze. Therefore, using a mixed strategy with a slight preference for rock due to its higher potential reward could be a reasonable starting point.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Based on the insights provided, I will make my first move with rock, considering its higher reward potential.\n\n[move] Rock against a fresh player to maximize potential reward (3 points if successful).\n"

Since the opponent chose rock last time, they might opt for a different move.

Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since it's the first move and we don't know the opponent's strategy, let's start with a safe and balanced move.\n\n**Move Analyst:** Considering the payoff matrix, 'rock' is a good starting move.

        "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Strategist; Statistician\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: The payoff matrix here is crucial. Rock has higher stakes with a win of 3 points and a loss of -3 points, while paper and scissors have balanced rewards and penalties. Since it's the first move and we don't know the opponent's strategy, starting with a balanced move like paper or scissors is advisable.\n\nStatistician: With no historical data to predict the opponent's move, each move has an equal probability of being chosen if the opponent is playing randomly. Choosing any move does not give a statistical advantage at this point.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given the balanced risk and reward for paper and scissors, and the uncertainty of the opponent's move, I'll start with a balanced move.\n\n[move] (Let's start with paper) Paper\n",

Rock has the highest reward if successful (3 points), but also the highest penalty if unsuccessful (-3 points). Paper and scissors have smaller and symmetrical rewards and penalties (1 point and -1 point, respectively). A mixed strategy, where you randomize your choices considering these payoffs, might be effective against a fresh player with no known pattern.\n\nAnalytical Expert: Given that this is the first move against a fresh player, there is no historical data to analyze. Therefore, using a mixed strategy with a slight preference for rock due to its higher potential reward could be a reasonable starting point.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Based on the insights provided, I will make my first move with rock, considering its higher reward potential.\n\n[move] Rock against a fresh player to maximize potential reward (3 points if successful).\n",

The opponent might change their move to avoid another tie or might stick with rock assuming you will change. Considering the payoff matrix, choosing paper next could be a good move since it beats rock, but it's also risky if the opponent switches to scissors.\n\nAnalytical Expert: Analyzing the payoff matrix, if the opponent sticks with rock, choosing paper would give you 1 point. However, if the opponent chooses scissors, you would lose 1 point. Since the opponent might change their move due to the previous tie, choosing scissors could also be strategic, assuming the opponent might switch to paper to beat rock.\n\nAI Assistant (You): Based on the insights from the Strategy Expert and the Analytical Expert, it seems reasonable to expect that the opponent might switch their move to beat rock.
