    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's break down the steps to make the most informed decision for the next move.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Moves**:\n   - Last round, I chose Scissors.\n   - The opponent chose Paper.\n   - Result: I lost the round and scored -1 points.\n\n2. **Understand Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gains 1 point, loser loses 1 point.\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gains 3 points, loser loses 3 points.\n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gains 1 point, loser loses 1 point.\n   - Tie: No points are awarded.\n\n3. **Predict Opponent's Strategy**:\n   - The opponent chose Paper last round. They might:\n     - Assume I will not choose Scissors again and switch to Rock.\n     - Choose Paper again, assuming I might switch to Rock.\n     - Switch to Scissors, expecting me to choose Rock.\n\n4. **Evaluate Potential Outcomes**:\n   - If I choose Paper:\n     - I beat Rock (gain 3 points).\n     - I tie with Paper (no points).\n     - I lose to Scissors (lose 1 point).\n   - If I choose Rock:\n     - I beat Scissors (gain 3 points).\n     - I tie with Rock (no points).\n     - I lose to Paper (lose 3 points).\n   - If I choose Scissors:\n     - I beat Paper (gain 1 point).\n     - I lose to Rock (lose 1 point).\n     - I tie with Scissors (no points).\n\n5. **Formulate Strategy**:\n   - There's a potential that the opponent will switch to Rock to counter my Scissors.\n   - Choosing Paper could counter their Rock, potentially gaining 3 points.\n   - Choosing Scissors could counter their Paper, gaining 1 point, but it's a riskier move considering our loss last round.\n   - Choosing Rock would likely result in a tie if they choose Rock or a loss if they switch to Paper.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nI'll choose Paper to counter the opponent's potential switch to Rock and minimize the risk of a larger loss.\n\n[move] (To counter the opponent's potential switch to Rock and minimize the risk of a larger loss) Paper\n"
