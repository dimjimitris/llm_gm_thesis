I'll try to use this to my advantage by choosing a move that can beat the move they're likely to mirror. Since they mirrored paper, they might mirror scissors as well. However, I'll take a chance and choose scissors, hoping that they'll make a mistake or deviate from their strategy. If they choose paper, I'll win with scissors and gain 1 point. I'll keep trying to find a way to break the tie and gain an advantage. It's possible that my opponent is trying to lull me into a false sense of security with their mirroring strategy, so I'll need to stay vigilant and be prepared to adapt my strategy if necessary.\n"

I'll go back to a basic approach and choose rock, which is a well-rounded move that can win against scissors. I've had success with rock in the past, winning a round against my opponent's scissors earlier in the game. If my opponent continues to mirror, we'll have another tie. However, if they're starting to get tired of the mirroring strategy or trying to mix things up, they might choose a different move, such as paper, which would give me a loss, or scissors, which would give me a win with rock and 1 point. I'll keep trying to find a way to break the tie and gain an advantage.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
