        "[move] rock \nI've won two rounds in a row, and my opponent's moves have been more predictable. In the previous round, my scissors beat their rock, which is an unexpected outcome since scissors typically lose to rock. This suggests that my opponent may have made a mistake or is starting to deviate from their usual strategy. I'll try to take advantage of this and choose rock, which is a move that has beaten my opponent's paper in the past. I'm hoping to catch my opponent off guard and win again, but I'm also prepared for the possibility that they may adapt and change their strategy.\n"
