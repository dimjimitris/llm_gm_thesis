Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

        "[move] paper \nAnother tie, this time with rock. I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop. I'm going to switch to paper, but I'm not feeling very optimistic about winning. At this point, I'm just trying to mix things up and see if I can catch my opponent off guard. Maybe they'll make a mistake or try something new, and I can take advantage of it. But if we just keep tying, I'm not sure what else to do.\n",
        "[move] paper \nAnother tie, this time with rock. I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop. I'm going to switch to paper, but I'm not really expecting a different outcome. I'm just going to keep making moves and see if my opponent ever deviates from their strategy. Maybe if I keep switching between rock, paper, and scissors, my opponent will eventually make a mistake and I'll be able to win.

        "[move] paper \nWe've had another tie, this time with rock. I'm starting to feel like we're in a loop, where we just keep making the same moves and tying. I'm going to try to break this cycle by making a move that is not rock, which has been the most common move lately. I'm choosing paper, but I'm not really expecting to win or lose, I'm just trying to mix things up and see if I can get a different outcome. Maybe my opponent will finally make a different move and we can get out of this tie loop.\n",
        "[move] paper \nAnother tie with rock. I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop. I'm going to try something different, but not too different. I'll switch to paper, which is a move that I've made before, but not recently. I'm hoping that my opponent will either stick with rock, which would allow me to win, or switch to scissors, which would result in a loss for me. But at this point, I'm not expecting anything other than another tie. I'm just going through the motions, waiting for something to change.\n"
