    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I've won with scissors against paper multiple times, the other player might anticipate another scissors move and prepare to counter it with rock. By moving to rock myself, I'm preparing for the possibility that the other player tries to counter my previous winning move, and also considering that rock is a solid move that can set me up for a potential win in the next round. Additionally, rock is a move that can potentially catch the other player off guard if they're expecting another scissors move, and it also gives me an opportunity to counter their potential move if they decide to switch to scissors.\n"

Given this, I'll switch to paper, aiming to break the tie and gain points. If the other player sticks with rock, paper should give me an advantage. This move is a straightforward attempt to capitalize on the situation and secure a win, while also being mindful of the potential for another tie or the other player adapting their strategy. By moving to paper, I'm trying to create an opportunity to gain points and take the lead, and also trying to mix up my moves to make it harder for the other player to anticipate my next move. The pattern of ties suggests that the other player may be reacting to my moves, so I'll try to use this to my advantage.\n"

To attempt to break this cycle, I'll switch to scissors, hoping that the other player will either stick with paper, allowing me to win, or switch to a different move that I can potentially counter. Given the consistent mirroring, there's a chance the other player will repeat their move, and scissors beats paper, making it a strategic choice to try and secure a win. I've had success with scissors against paper in the past, and I'm trying to replicate that success while also considering the possibility that the other player may try to adapt and counter my move. Since we've tied multiple times with the same moves, I'm trying to use this pattern to my advantage and catch the other player off guard.\n"
