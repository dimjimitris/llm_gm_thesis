Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

If the opponent chooses paper, rock will lose. However, if they choose scissors again or switch to a move that rock can beat, I have a chance to win. Given the opponent's recent deviation from the mirroring pattern, I'm cautiously testing their next move to see if they will return to mirroring or continue to adapt and make strategic choices.\n"

This could indicate that the opponent has returned to their mirroring strategy after deviating in the previous round. By choosing paper, I'm making a move that directly counters rock, which we both chose in the last round. If the opponent sticks with rock, paper will win. If they adapt and choose scissors, paper will lose. Given the recent tie and the opponent's previous ability to deviate from mirroring, I'm testing whether they will continue to mirror or make a strategic move to counter my choice. This move also follows the natural cycle of the game (rock > paper > scissors), preparing for the possibility that the opponent might follow this pattern.\n"

This suggests that the opponent is prioritizing avoiding loss over trying to win, or they are using a strategy that emphasizes matching my moves. By choosing scissors, I'm following the cycle of the game (paper > scissors) and seeing if the opponent will continue to mirror. If they do, we'll have another tie. However, if the opponent decides to break the pattern and tries to outmaneuver me, scissors gives me a chance to win if they choose paper. Given the ongoing ties, it's possible that the game is becoming more about waiting for the opponent to make a mistake rather than trying to out-strategize them.

Given the long series of ties, it's becoming increasingly clear that the opponent's strategy is focused on not losing rather than winning, which makes it challenging to gain an advantage through strategic moves alone.

If the opponent chooses rock again, we'll likely have another tie.

The goal remains to identify any deviation from the opponent's mirroring pattern and capitalize on it to gain an advantage. At this stage, it's also possible that the opponent's strategy is not just about mirroring but also about waiting for me to make a mistake, so I'll continue to make strategic choices to see if I can outmaneuver them.\n"
