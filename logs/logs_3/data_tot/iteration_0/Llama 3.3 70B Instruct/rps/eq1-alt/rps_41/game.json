By choosing rock, I'm starting the cycle over (rock > paper > scissors) and observing whether the opponent will continue to mirror. If they do, we'll have another tie. Given the long series of ties, it's becoming increasingly clear that the opponent's strategy is focused on not losing rather than winning, which makes it challenging to gain an advantage through strategic moves alone.

If the opponent chooses rock again, we'll likely have another tie. However, if they deviate from the mirroring strategy, paper has the potential to win if they choose rock or lose if they choose scissors. The goal remains to identify any deviation from the opponent's mirroring pattern and capitalize on it to gain an advantage.

To test this and potentially break the tie streak, I'm reverting to rock. This move is basic and foundational, and if the opponent continues to mirror, we'll see another tie.

Since the last move was paper, the opponent might mirror again with scissors (which beats paper), so I'll choose rock, which beats scissors. This strategy tests whether the opponent's mirroring is based on the immediate previous move or if they're adapting to the pattern of the game.\n",

Since the pattern continues regardless of my strategy, I'll simplify my approach and make a move without overthinking the potential counter-move. Rock is a basic, foundational move that has a chance to win if the opponent doesn't mirror it.

However, I'm going to disrupt this expectation by choosing rock again, which is a move that has been made before and could potentially be predicted by the opponent.

By choosing rock again, I'm testing whether the opponent will revert to their previous mirroring behavior or if they've indeed changed their strategy. If they mirror, we'll tie again; if they adapt based on the previous round's win, they might choose paper to beat rock, but there's also a chance they could choose rock again, hoping I'll switch.
