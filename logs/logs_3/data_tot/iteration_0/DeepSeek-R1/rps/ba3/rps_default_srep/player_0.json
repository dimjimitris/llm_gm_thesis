    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": ") needing to respond correctly. Let me re-express.\n\nThe user's first move had an explanation in parentheses, but the system said there was an error. The correction required is to structure the move message properly. The key points are: the move message must start with [move], optional explanation in parentheses (without nested parentheses), then the move. So the explanation should be a single parenthetical statement, no periods maybe? Or perhaps the initial explanation was too verbose. Let me check the example given in the hint: \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\". So the explanation is in parentheses, followed by the move. The user's first attempt was \"[move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, choosing paper maximizes potential points.) Paper\". The parentheses are correctly used, but maybe the period inside the parentheses is an issue. Or perhaps the explanation is too long. The system's example uses a short explanation. Alternatively, the error might have been that the user included a period after the parentheses. Wait, in the example, the explanation is in parentheses, then the move. The user's first message had a period after the closing parenthesis, which might not be allowed. Let me check: the example shows \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\" \u2013 no punctuation after the parentheses. The user's original message had a period after the closing parenthesis, which might be the error. So the correction is to remove the period after the parentheses. Therefore, the correct format would be \"[move] (Explanation) Paper\" without a period after the parentheses. So the user's corrected response should be \"[move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, choosing paper maximizes potential points) Paper\". That way, the explanation is in parentheses, no nested parentheses, and the move follows immediately after without a period. That should comply with the format specified in the error message.\n</think>\n\n[move] (Anticipating a common first move of rock from a new player, choosing paper maximizes potential points) Paper\n"
