    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze my opponent's recent evolution:\n   - Their moves: paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock\n   - Final tally: paper (4 times), rock (4 times), scissors (1 time)\n   - They've now balanced their use of paper and rock\n   - Recent pattern shows: rock, scissors, rock\n\n3. Look for emerging patterns:\n   - They used rock twice in the last 3 rounds\n   - They're becoming less predictable overall\n   - They might be trying to match or counter my moves more actively\n\n4. Consider what they might expect from me:\n   - I've chosen rock 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock\n   - Or they might think I'll finally switch after two ties\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they expect me to choose rock again, they might choose paper to beat it\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose rock (but I've been doing that)\n   - If they choose scissors again, I should choose rock\n   - If I want to break my rock pattern, paper would beat rock if they expect me to repeat\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Since they might expect another rock from me, and paper beats rock, I'll switch to paper\n   - This also covers the case where they choose scissors (though rock would be better for that)\n\n[move] (Switching to paper to counter a potential rock choice, breaking my recent rock pattern) paper"

Consider a different approach:\n   - I've been trying to counter their expected moves\n   - Maybe I should focus on the move they use least: scissors\n   - They've only used scissors once in 10 rounds\n   - If they avoid scissors, choosing scissors myself covers rock (I win) and paper (I lose), but avoids ties\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - Scissors beats paper (their most common choice)\n   - Scissors loses to rock but wins against paper\n   - Since they rarely use scissors, this reduces tie probability\n   - Even if they choose rock, I only lose 1 point vs gaining nothing from ties\n\n6.

Notice the strong exploitable pattern:\n   - My opponent seems to have developed a conditional response\n   - When I choose rock, they very frequently choose paper (5 out of last 6 times)\n   - This might be unconscious or a deliberate strategy\n   - They may be stuck in a pattern they can't break\n\n4. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - This pattern is incredibly valuable to exploit\n   - They might continue this rock \u2192 paper response\n   - Or they might finally recognize the pattern and switch\n   - The risk of them choosing scissors (which beats rock) is present but historically low\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they continue the pattern (paper when I choose rock), rock wins again\n   - If they break the pattern with scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose rock, we tie\n   - The pattern has been so consistent that it's worth exploiting further\n\n6.
