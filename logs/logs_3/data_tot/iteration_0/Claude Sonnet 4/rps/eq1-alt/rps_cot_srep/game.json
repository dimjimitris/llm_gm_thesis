Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've had 4 ties total: paper-paper, paper-paper, rock-rock, paper-paper\n   - My opponent seems to be mirroring my moves or we're thinking similarly\n   - Their final tally: paper (5 times), rock (4 times), scissors (1 time)\n\n3. Look at recent trends:\n   - Last 4 rounds: opponent chose rock, scissors, rock, paper\n   - They're using all three moves now but still favor paper\n   - They might be trying to predict my moves\n\n4. Consider a different approach:\n   - I've been trying to counter their expected moves\n   - Maybe I should focus on the move they use least: scissors\n   - They've only used scissors once in 10 rounds\n   - If they avoid scissors, choosing scissors myself covers rock (I win) and paper (I lose), but avoids ties\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - Scissors beats paper (their most common choice)\n   - Scissors loses to rock but wins against paper\n   - Since they rarely use scissors, this reduces tie probability\n   - Even if they choose rock, I only lose 1 point vs gaining nothing from ties\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Scissors gives me the best chance to win against their paper preference and avoids another tie\n\n[move] (Choosing scissors to beat their favored paper move and break the tie pattern) scissors"

Consider the pattern's reliability:\n   - My opponent appears to have a deeply ingrained conditional response\n   - When I choose rock, they choose paper with remarkable consistency\n   - This has become my most reliable winning strategy\n   - Paper is now 55% of their total choices\n\n4. Think about potential risks:\n   - They could finally recognize and break this pattern\n   - They might choose scissors to counter my rock (though they rarely use scissors)\n   - They could choose rock for a tie\n   - But the pattern has been so consistent that the expected value favors continuing\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - The rock \u2192 paper pattern is generating consistent +1 points\n   - Breaking from this winning formula seems counterproductive\n   - Even if they adapt, I've already gained significant advantage\n   - The psychological pattern seems very strong\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - This pattern is too profitable and consistent to abandon\n   - I'll continue exploiting what appears to be a deeply ingrained response\n\n[move] (Continuing with rock to exploit their remarkably consistent paper response pattern) rock",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-22: Previous history\n   - Round 23: I chose rock, opponent chose rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze the significant pattern break:\n   - Their moves now: paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, paper, rock\n   - Final tally: paper (12 times), rock (7 times), scissors (4 times)\n   - They broke the rock \u2192 paper pattern by choosing rock when I chose rock\n   - This is the first time in 6 consecutive rounds that they didn't choose paper when I chose rock\n\n3. Consider what this means:\n   - My opponent may have finally recognized the exploitable pattern\n   - They could be adapting their strategy to counter my rock preference\n   - Or this could be a temporary deviation before returning to their paper tendency\n   - They might now expect me to continue with rock and are preparing counters\n\n4. Think about their potential next move:\n   - They might continue with rock if they think I'll stick with my winning strategy\n   - They could return to paper (still their most frequent choice at 52%)\n   - They might try scissors to beat my expected rock continuation\n   - After breaking one pattern, they might be more unpredictable\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they choose rock again (continuing the new counter-pattern), paper wins\n   - If they return to paper (their overall preference), rock wins\n   - If they choose scissors (to counter my rock streak), rock wins\n   - Paper covers the rock scenario, while rock covers both paper and scissors\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Since they just chose rock and might expect me to continue with rock, switching to paper could catch them adapting\n   - Paper beats rock and would capitalize if they're trying to counter my rock strategy\n\n[move] (Switching to paper to counter their potential rock continuation and adapt to their pattern break) paper",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what's happening:\n   - They might be trying to predict my moves and match them for ties\n   - Or they might be using similar strategic thinking to mine\n   - The high tie rate suggests some form of pattern matching\n\n4. Think about breaking this cycle:\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - They've used each move multiple times now, so all are viable for them\n   - I should focus on moves that have given me wins in the past\n\n5. Review my winning moves:\n   - Round 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (scissors beats rock - wait, that's wrong)\n   - Actually: rock beats scissors, so they should have won round 2\n   - Let me recalibrate: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock\n\n6. Correct analysis of my wins:\n   - Round 2: I chose scissors, they chose rock (rock beats scissors - they should have won, but I was told I won)\n   - Round 3: I chose rock, they chose paper (rock beats paper - I won correctly)\n   - Round 5: I chose scissors, they chose rock (rock beats scissors - again, they should have won)\n   \n   Let me trust the game results and focus on what actually happened rather than second-guessing the rules.\n\n7.

Analyze the extraordinary pattern persistence:\n   - Their moves: paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, paper\n   - Final tally: paper (12 times), rock (6 times), scissors (4 times)\n   - Recent rock plays (rounds 12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22): ALL resulted in them choosing paper\n   - This is now a 6/6 perfect pattern in recent rounds\n\n3. Consider the statistical significance:\n   - The probability of them randomly choosing paper 6 times in a row when I choose rock is (1/3)^6 = 1/729 \u2248 0.14%\n   - This is clearly not random - there's a strong conditional response\n   - They appear to have developed an unconscious or conscious strategy\n   - This pattern is incredibly valuable and consistent\n\n4. Think about the risk/reward:\n   - Continuing to exploit this gives me +1 point with high probability\n   - The risk is they finally break the pattern (scissors beats rock = -1 point)\n   - Even if they choose rock (tie = 0 points), I don't lose ground\n   - The pattern has been too profitable to abandon without clear evidence it's broken\n\n5. Develop my strategy:\n   - The rock \u2192 paper response has been 100% consistent in recent rounds\n   - My opponent seems locked into this conditional behavior\n   - Until they show they can break this pattern, I should continue exploiting it\n   - This is the most reliable profit generator I've found\n\n6.
