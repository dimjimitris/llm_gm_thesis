    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what move they might make:\n   - Fresh players often don't have a developed strategy\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels like a \"strong\" move\n   - Some might choose randomly\n\n3. If I assume the opponent is likely to play rock (common beginner choice), then I should play paper to beat rock and earn +1 point.\n\n4. Even if my assumption is wrong, each move has an equal 1/3 chance against a random opponent, so any choice is equally valid from a pure probability standpoint.\n\n5. Playing paper gives me the best chance if my read on the fresh player choosing rock is correct.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially beat a likely rock choice from the fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

The hint says I won, but that contradicts the game rules - scissors should beat paper.\n\n2. Wait, let me re-read the rules more carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - This means paper beats scissors, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules I'm familiar with.\n\n3. So the rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n\n4. My opponent just played scissors in the first round. Now I need to predict their second move:\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think it was a good choice\n   - They might switch to try something different\n   - They might have learned that scissors loses to paper and avoid it\n\n5. If they stick with scissors, I should play paper again.\n   If they switch to rock (thinking it's strong), I should play scissors.\n   If they switch to paper (copying my winning move), I should play rock.\n\n6. Since they're a fresh player and just lost, they might either:\n   - Try rock thinking it's stronger\n   - Copy my winning paper move\n   - Stick with scissors not realizing the pattern\n\n7.
