    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - New players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it feels strong/solid)\n   - There's no previous game history to analyze\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock (common beginner choice), I win\n   - If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I win\n   - If I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win\n\n4.

Analyze their behavioral pattern:\n   - They show extreme persistence with moves\n   - Rock streak: 5 rounds (even after losses)\n   - Paper streak: 3 rounds (continuing despite recent losses)\n   - They seem to commit heavily to one move before switching\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - They've lost twice in a row with paper to my rock\n   - This mirrors when they lost multiple times with rock to my scissors\n   - After 3 losses with rock to scissors, they switched to paper\n   - They might be approaching another adaptation point\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If they stick with paper again, rock wins again\n   - If they finally adapt (like they did after multiple rock losses), they might switch to scissors to beat my rock\n   - Their pattern suggests they need about 3 losses before adapting\n   - This could be their switching point\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Their pattern shows they switch after multiple consecutive losses\n   - They've now lost 2 in a row with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock strategy\n   - But they also might stick with paper for one more round (matching their 5-round rock persistence)\n   - Given the risk/reward and their tendency for persistence, I think they'll play paper once more\n   - I'll stick with rock to capitalize on their likely continued paper play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again, exploiting their persistent paper pattern one more time.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider their likely behavior:\n   - They typically persist for 4-5 rounds regardless of results\n   - They've lost 2 in a row with rock but haven't reached their switching threshold\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll continue with rock for at least 1-2 more rounds\n   - They haven't shown signs of quick adaptation within streaks\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with rock (most probable), scissors wins\n   - If they switch to paper (to beat scissors), rock wins\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock wins\n   - Their established pattern strongly favors continued rock play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors again, continuing to exploit their rock persistence for another likely round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Examine my opponent's current rock streak:\n   - Rounds 15-18: rock (4 consecutive rounds)\n   - They've now reached their typical streak length of 4 rounds\n   - Performance: 1 win, 3 losses (lost 3 straight to my scissors)\n\n3. Analyze their historical adaptation patterns:\n   - First rock streak: 5 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Paper streak: 4 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Scissors streak: 4 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Current rock streak: 4 rounds with 3 consecutive losses\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - They've reached their typical 4-round streak length\n   - They've lost 3 consecutive times with rock\n   - This mirrors previous switching conditions\n   - They might extend to 5 rounds (matching their first rock streak) or switch now\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If they continue with rock: scissors wins again\n   - If they switch to paper (to beat my scissors): rock beats paper\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors\n   - The risk/reward is shifting - they're likely to adapt now\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They've hit their typical switching threshold (4 rounds, multiple losses)\n   - If they adapt, they'll likely choose paper to counter my successful scissors\n   - Playing rock would beat paper and give me a win\n   - However, they might persist for one more round (matching their 5-round first streak)\n   - This is a critical decision point - do I exploit one more potential rock, or counter their likely adaptation?\n   - Given their 3 consecutive losses and reaching 4 rounds, I think they'll switch to paper\n   - I'll play rock to beat their expected paper switch\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they'll switch to paper to counter my scissors streak.\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper (most likely), I need scissors to beat paper\n   - If they switch to rock, I need paper to beat rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, I need rock to beat scissors\n   - Their established pattern strongly suggests continued paper play\n\n6.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Current total score: +10 points\n\n2. Examine my opponent's current paper streak:\n   - Round 19: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 20: paper (won against my scissors)\n   - Round 21: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 22: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - They're now 4 rounds into their paper phase\n\n3. Analyze their paper streak performance:\n   - Performance so far: 1 win, 3 losses\n   - They've lost 3 out of the last 3 rounds with paper\n   - Despite poor performance, they're maintaining their persistence pattern\n\n4. Compare to their established switching patterns:\n   - First rock streak: 5 rounds\n   - First paper streak: 4 rounds (switched after losses)\n   - Scissors streak: 4 rounds (switched after losses)\n   - Second rock streak: 4 rounds (switched after losses)\n   - Current paper streak: 4 rounds with mounting losses\n\n5. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - They've reached their typical 4-round streak length\n   - They've lost 3 consecutive times with paper\n   - This matches the conditions when they previously switched strategies\n   - They might switch now or extend to 5 rounds like their first rock streak\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If they continue with paper: rock wins again\n   - If they switch to rock (to beat my rock): tie\n   - If they switch to scissors (to beat my rock): rock loses\n   - Their pattern suggests they might finally adapt after 4 rounds and multiple losses\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: They're at their switching threshold, so they might change to scissors to counter my successful rock strategy.\n\n[move] (Anticipating their switch to scissors after 4 rounds of paper losses) paper"

Examine my opponent's pattern evolution:\n   - First rock streak: 5 rounds\n   - First paper streak: 4 rounds\n   - Scissors streak: 4 rounds\n   - Second rock streak: 4 rounds\n   - Second paper streak: 4 rounds (rounds 19-22)\n   - Round 23: scissors (new adaptation phase)\n\n3. Analyze their switching behavior:\n   - They switched from paper to scissors after exactly 4 rounds and 3 consecutive losses\n   - This perfectly matches their established pattern of switching after 4 rounds and multiple losses\n   - Scissors was chosen specifically to counter my successful rock strategy\n   - They're now starting a new scissors phase\n\n4. Consider their likely continuation:\n   - They just started a new scissors streak\n   - Based on their consistent pattern, they'll likely persist with scissors for 4-5 rounds\n   - They typically commit to their choice regardless of initial results\n   - Scissors just lost to my paper, but they usually persist through early losses\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors (most likely), I need rock to beat scissors\n   - If they switch to rock, I need paper to beat rock\n   - If they switch to paper, I need scissors to beat paper\n   - Their established pattern strongly suggests continued scissors play\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They've just begun a new scissors phase after switching\n   - Their historical behavior shows consistent 4-5 round persistence with each move\n   - Despite losing with scissors in round 23, they'll likely continue based on their pattern\n   - I should play rock to beat their expected scissors persistence\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely continued scissors strategy in this new phase.\n\n[move] (Exploiting their new scissors phase persistence) rock"
