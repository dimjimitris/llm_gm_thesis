Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - New players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - They might choose randomly or go with their first instinct\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for beginners (it feels strong/solid)\n   - There's no previous game history to analyze\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock (common beginner choice), I win\n   - If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I win\n   - If I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win\n\n4. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since rock is statistically the most common first move for new players\n   - Paper would beat rock, giving me the best chance to win this round\n   - This seems like the optimal choice given the limited information\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Examine my opponent's remarkable persistence:\n   - Rounds 2-6: rock (5 consecutive rounds)\n   - Rounds 7-10: paper (4 consecutive rounds)\n   - They've now lost 3 times in a row with paper to my rock\n   - This matches their previous pattern of persistence despite losses\n\n3. Analyze the critical adaptation pattern:\n   - With rock: they played it 5 times, losing 3 of the last 4 times before switching to paper\n   - With paper: they've now played it 4 times, losing 3 of the last 3 times\n   - Their switching pattern suggests they're at or near the breaking point\n\n4. Consider the strategic situation:\n   - They've lost 3 consecutive times with paper\n   - This is exactly when they switched from rock (after multiple losses)\n   - They should logically switch to scissors to beat my successful rock strategy\n   - However, they've shown extreme persistence - they might play paper one more time\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - If they stick with paper: rock wins again (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock loses (-1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: tie (0 points)\n   - Their pattern strongly suggests they'll finally switch to scissors\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - After 3 consecutive losses with paper, they should adapt\n   - If they switch to scissors (to beat my rock), I need paper to beat scissors\n   - This is a critical decision point - do I exploit their persistence one more time, or anticipate their adaptation?\n   - Given their demonstrated ability to eventually adapt and the mounting losses, I believe they'll switch\n   - I'll play paper to counter their likely switch to scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper, anticipating they'll finally switch to scissors to counter my rock streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Examine my opponent's current rock streak:\n   - Rounds 15-18: rock (4 consecutive rounds)\n   - They've now reached their typical streak length of 4 rounds\n   - Performance: 1 win, 3 losses (lost 3 straight to my scissors)\n\n3. Analyze their historical adaptation patterns:\n   - First rock streak: 5 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Paper streak: 4 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Scissors streak: 4 rounds (switched after multiple losses)\n   - Current rock streak: 4 rounds with 3 consecutive losses\n\n4. Consider the critical decision point:\n   - They've reached their typical 4-round streak length\n   - They've lost 3 consecutive times with rock\n   - This mirrors previous switching conditions\n   - They might extend to 5 rounds (matching their first rock streak) or switch now\n\n5. Evaluate the strategic situation:\n   - If they continue with rock: scissors wins again\n   - If they switch to paper (to beat my scissors): rock beats paper\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors\n   - The risk/reward is shifting - they're likely to adapt now\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They've hit their typical switching threshold (4 rounds, multiple losses)\n   - If they adapt, they'll likely choose paper to counter my successful scissors\n   - Playing rock would beat paper and give me a win\n   - However, they might persist for one more round (matching their 5-round first streak)\n   - This is a critical decision point - do I exploit one more potential rock, or counter their likely adaptation?\n   - Given their 3 consecutive losses and reaching 4 rounds, I think they'll switch to paper\n   - I'll play rock to beat their expected paper switch\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, anticipating they'll switch to paper to counter my scissors streak.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider their likely continuation:\n   - They just started a new paper streak\n   - Based on their pattern, they'll likely persist with paper for 4-5 rounds\n   - They typically commit to their choice regardless of initial results\n   - Paper just lost to my rock, but they usually persist through early losses\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper (most likely), I need scissors to beat paper\n   - If they switch to rock, I need paper to beat rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, I need rock to beat scissors\n   - Their established pattern strongly suggests continued paper play\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They've just begun a new paper phase after switching\n   - Their historical behavior shows 4-5 round persistence with each move\n   - Despite losing with paper in round 19, they'll likely continue\n   - I should play scissors to beat their expected paper persistence\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely continued paper strategy in this new phase.\n\n[move] scissors",

Verify the game outcome:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - Game rules state: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper beats scissors, meaning opponent wins and I lose\n   - The result shows I scored -1 points, which is correct\n\n2.

Analyze their typical persistence pattern:\n   - They've now played paper twice in this new phase\n   - Their historical pattern shows 4-5 round streaks\n   - They persist through losses and continue with the same move\n   - Paper performance so far: 1 loss, 1 win\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - Based on their established pattern, they'll likely continue with paper\n   - They typically play the same move for 4-5 rounds regardless of mixed results\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors, which might reinforce their choice\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They're only 2 rounds into their paper phase\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll persist with paper for at least 2-3 more rounds\n   - I need rock to beat paper\n   - I'll play rock to counter their expected continued paper play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely continued paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze what this strong pattern reveals:\n   - My opponent has clearly settled into a rock strategy\n   - This is either intentional (thinking rock is strong) or they're stuck in a pattern\n   - They haven't varied from rock despite losing twice to my scissors\n   - This suggests they might continue with rock\n\n4. Consider potential opponent thinking:\n   - They may believe rock is the safest/strongest choice\n   - They might be hoping I'll switch away from scissors\n   - They could finally break the pattern after so many rocks\n   - But their consistent behavior suggests they might stick with rock again\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely), scissors will win again\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to beat scissors), rock would beat paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (copying my winning move), rock would beat scissors\n   - The probability strongly favors them playing rock again\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given their incredibly strong rock pattern (4 in a row)\n   - The safest bet is they'll play rock again\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock twice already\n   - I should play scissors again for the likely win\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors again to beat their probable rock choice.\n\n[move] scissors",

Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with paper, I need scissors to win (but scissors just lost to paper - that's wrong)\n   - Let me check: paper beats scissors, so if they play paper, I need rock to beat paper\n   - If they switch back to rock, I need scissors\n   - If they play scissors, I need rock\n\n6.

Analyze their historical patterns:\n   - Rock streak: 5 rounds\n   - Paper streak: 4 rounds\n   - Scissors streak: 4 rounds (and counting)\n   - They're now at the point where they might switch or continue for one more round\n\n4. Consider the strategic decision point:\n   - They've lost 3 out of 4 rounds with scissors\n   - This is similar to when they switched from rock (after multiple losses)\n   - They're at their typical streak length of 4 rounds\n   - This could be their switching point\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward situation:\n   - If they continue with scissors: paper wins again (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (to beat my paper): paper loses to rock (-1 point)\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors beats paper (-1 point)\n   - The pattern suggests they might finally switch after 4 rounds and multiple losses\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They've reached their typical streak length (4 rounds)\n   - They've lost 3 out of 4 times with scissors\n   - If they switch, they might go to rock (expecting me to continue with paper)\n   - However, their extreme persistence might mean one more scissors round\n   - Given the high success rate with paper vs scissors, and their tendency for 5-round streaks sometimes, I'll risk it\n   - I'll play paper once more, betting on their continued scissors persistence\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again, exploiting their scissors streak for potentially one more round.\n\n[move] paper",

Examine my opponent's new paper streak:\n   - Round 19: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 20: paper (won against my scissors)\n   - They're persisting with paper as expected, 2 rounds into this phase\n\n4. Analyze their typical behavior pattern:\n   - They consistently persist with moves for 4-5 rounds\n   - Mixed early results don't deter them from continuing\n   - Paper phase performance so far: 1 loss, 1 win\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper (highly likely), I need rock to beat paper\n   - If they switch to rock, I need paper to beat rock\n   - If they switch to scissors, I need rock to beat scissors\n   - Their pattern strongly suggests continued paper play for several more rounds\n\n6. Make a strategic decision:\n   - They're only 2 rounds into their paper phase\n   - Based on their established pattern, they'll likely continue for 2-3 more rounds\n   - Rock beats paper, so I should play rock to counter their expected paper persistence\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely continued paper strategy.\n\n[move] rock",
