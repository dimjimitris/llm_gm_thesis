    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a zero-sum game where one player's gain equals the other's loss\n   - Each move has an equal chance of winning against one move and losing against another\n   - Paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no historical data about their playing patterns\n\n3. Evaluate strategy options:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information to predict their move\n   - In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move is theoretically equally good\n   - Fresh/new players often have certain tendencies (like choosing rock first due to its perceived strength)\n\n4. Make an optimal first move:\n   - Many inexperienced players tend to choose rock as their first move because it feels \"strong\"\n   - If this tendency exists, playing paper would give me the best chance of winning\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, paper has an equal 1/3 chance against any random selection\n\n[move] paper"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - Both my opponent and I chose paper\n   - This resulted in a tie with 0 points for both\n   - My assumption about fresh players choosing rock was incorrect for this opponent\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They also chose paper, which could mean:\n     - They had similar reasoning to mine (expecting rock from a \"fresh player\")\n     - They have their own strategy or pattern\n     - It could be coincidental\n\n3. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, some players stick with the same move\n   - Others deliberately change their move\n   - Some players might think I'll switch since we tied\n\n4. Develop strategy for Round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors, so I should play rock\n   - If they randomly switch, any move has equal probability\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - Given that we both chose paper (possibly for similar strategic reasons), there's a reasonable chance they might stick with paper or expect me to stick with paper\n   - Playing scissors covers both scenarios: it beats paper if they repeat, and it's one of three equally valid options if they switch randomly\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider opponent's psychology after winning with rock:\n   - They just won with rock after two ties\n   - This reinforces rock as their \"successful\" move\n   - They might continue with rock (fourth in a row)\n   - Or they might finally switch after such a long streak\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - Given their extreme preference for rock (5 out of 9 rounds) and their current three-round streak\n   - Plus they just won with rock, which reinforces the behavior\n   - Playing paper is the obvious counter to their dominant strategy\n   - Even if they switch, paper gives me the best chance against their most likely move\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the significant pattern change:\n   - After 5 consecutive scissors, they switched to rock\n   - This confirms they were either testing me or following some strategy\n   - Rock count: 6 times total now\n   - Paper count: 5 times total\n   - Scissors count: 8 times total (heavily favored overall)\n\n3. Consider the psychology after breaking the scissors streak:\n   - They just switched from scissors to rock after 5 rounds\n   - The tie with rock might make them:\n     - Stick with rock (since it avoided a loss)\n     - Switch to paper (completing a cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper)\n     - Return to scissors (their most successful move)\n\n4. Evaluate what they might be thinking:\n   - After dominating with scissors for so long, rock didn't win\n   - They might return to scissors since it was working\n   - Or they might try paper to complete the cycle\n   - Or stick with rock for another round\n\n5. Strategic options with correct rules:\n   - If they return to scissors: I should play rock\n   - If they stick with rock: I should play paper\n   - If they switch to paper: I should play scissors\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - Given that scissors was their dominant and most successful strategy (5 wins in a row with it)\n   - And rock just tied (not a win), they might return to what worked\n   - Scissors has been their go-to move throughout the game\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors if they return to their winning pattern\n   - This covers their most likely move based on their overall game behavior\n\n[move] rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost, which means scissors beat rock\n   - But I thought rock beats scissors based on the rules provided\n   - Current total score: -3 points\n\n2. Re-examine the game rules carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So: Paper > Scissors, Rock > Paper, Scissors > Rock\n\n3. Confirm my understanding:\n   - Scissors beats Rock (I just lost rock vs scissors - correct)\n   - Rock beats Paper \n   - Paper beats Scissors (I won paper vs scissors in round 16 - correct)\n\n4. Analyze opponent's recent pattern with correct understanding:\n   - Round 16: Scissors (I won with paper)\n   - Round 17: Rock (we tied)\n   - Round 18: Scissors (they won against my rock)\n   - They're alternating between scissors and rock now\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just won with scissors again\n   - Pattern suggests: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - They might continue alternating and play rock next\n   - Or stick with scissors since it just won\n\n6. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock next: I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they stick with scissors: I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - Given the alternating pattern (scissors-rock-scissors), rock seems likely next\n   - Playing scissors would beat rock and help me recover\n\n[move] scissors"
