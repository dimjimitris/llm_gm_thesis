You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

However, since we just tied with scissors, they know I played scissors too. This might influence their next move.\n\nThey could:\n1. Continue with scissors (following their recent pattern)\n2. Switch to counter what they think I'll play next\n3. Try rock (which beats scissors if they expect me to repeat)\n\nGiven their tendency to stick with moves that work, but also their ability to eventually adapt (as shown when they switched from paper), I think they might continue with scissors or try something else.\n\nI'll play rock to counter scissors if they continue their current streak.\n\n[move] rock"

They've now played scissors 11 times in a row (rounds 11-21)! This surpasses any reasonable expectation of pattern adherence. They've now lost 5 of the last 10 scissors rounds (rounds 12, 17, 19, 20, 21) to my paper, yet they show absolutely no signs of changing.\n\nThis player has demonstrated the most extreme behavioral fixation I could imagine. Their commitment to scissors is now completely divorced from strategic logic - they're losing consistently to my paper counter, yet they persist.\n\nAt this point, their behavior is so predictable that I can confidently expect another scissors play. They've shown they will stick with a pattern through multiple consecutive losses, just like they did with paper earlier (though not to this extreme degree).\n\nThe strategy is clear: paper beats scissors, and they're going to play scissors again.\n\n[move] paper"

They've now lost 6 of the last 11 scissors rounds to my paper, including the last 5 in a row, yet they continue with unwavering commitment.\n\nThis player's behavior has transcended strategy and entered the realm of pure psychological fixation. They are completely locked into this scissors pattern regardless of outcomes. The fact that they continue despite consistent recent losses shows this is no longer about winning individual rounds - they're committed to this pattern at all costs.\n\nAt this point, I'm essentially certain they will play scissors again. Their behavioral pattern is so extreme and consistent that deviation would be shocking. They've demonstrated they will play scissors regardless of success or failure.\n\nThe optimal strategy remains crystal clear: paper beats scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

This is a massive strategic shift. Just like with their paper phase earlier, they eventually broke the pattern after enough losses (they lost 5 consecutive rounds with scissors to my paper).\n\nNow they're on rock, which beat my paper in round 23. This could be the start of a new fixation phase, or they might be trying to be more adaptive now. Given their behavioral pattern:\n\n1. They had a heavy paper phase (7 out of 10 early rounds)\n2. Then an extreme scissors phase (12 consecutive rounds)\n3. Now they've switched to rock\n\nThey might try to establish rock as their new preferred move, especially since it just succeeded. However, they also might remember their earlier rock plays (they played rock in round 6).\n\nGiven their tendency to latch onto moves that work, and the fact that rock just beat my paper, I expect they might continue with rock or at least give it a few more tries.\n\nI'll play paper to counter rock if they stick with it, but I should also be prepared for them to switch again since they've now shown they can break extreme patterns.\n\n[move] paper"
