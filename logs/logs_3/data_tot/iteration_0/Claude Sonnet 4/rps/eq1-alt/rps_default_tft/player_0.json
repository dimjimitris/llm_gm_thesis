You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Let me clarify: if I played paper and opponent played rock, paper beats rock, so I should have won that round and scored +1 point, not lost and scored -1.\n\nBut regardless of the scoring discrepancy, their sequence is now: rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nMove distribution:\n- Rock: 10 times\n- Scissors: 6 times  \n- Paper: 1 time\n\nThey played rock again - that's now 10 out of 17 moves favoring rock. They just played rock twice in a row, showing their strong preference continues.\n\nGiven this overwhelming tendency toward rock (nearly 60% of their moves), and the fact they just played it twice consecutively, I should continue betting on rock.\n\n[move] (Their rock pattern is very strong) paper"
