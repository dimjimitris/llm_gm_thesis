Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels \"strong\" or \"solid\"\n   - Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for inexperienced players\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they choose rock (likely), I should choose paper to win\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points\n   - This seems like the highest probability winning move against a fresh player\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper as my opening move to counter the likely rock choice\n\n[move] Paper"

Consider what they might be thinking:\n   - After I won round 21 by playing Rock vs their Paper, they know I figured something out\n   - They might be trying to counter-predict my moves now\n   - Playing Scissors when I expected them to play Rock suggests they're adapting\n\n5. Analyze the tie pattern return:\n   - We're back to tying after I briefly broke the pattern\n   - They might be trying to mirror my moves again\n   - Or they predicted I'd play Scissors to beat their expected Rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - With their pattern broken and strategy potentially shifted, this is harder\n   - Last move was Scissors, so if they're cycling through moves: next could be Paper or Rock\n   - If they're trying to counter-predict me, they might play what beats what they think I'll play\n\n7.

      "output_text": "Five ties in eight rounds now! This pattern is remarkably persistent. Let me analyze step-by-step.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 16: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: both paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: both rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 23: both paper (tie)\n   - Current total: +1 points\n\n2. Analyze what's happening:\n   - We keep converging on the same moves despite strategy changes\n   - This suggests we might be using similar prediction logic\n   - Or one of us is successfully mirroring the other's thought process\n\n3. Look at the sequence of ties:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - The pattern isn't perfectly cyclic, but there's clearly some underlying logic we're both following\n\n4. Consider the psychological game:\n   - We're both trying to predict each other\n   - When prediction methods are similar, ties become frequent\n   - Each tie gives information but also maintains the stalemate\n\n5. Strategic insight:\n   - To break this pattern, I need to think differently than they expect\n   - They might expect me to continue trying to predict their next move\n   - Or they might expect me to try something \"random\"\n\n6. Think about what they might predict I'll do:\n   - We just tied on Paper\n   - They might think I'll:\n     a) Move to Rock (next in a cycle)\n     b) Try Scissors (to counter if they stick with Paper)\n     c) Stay with Paper (if I think they'll change)\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - I'll go with Rock\n   - If they expect me to cycle through moves, they might play Paper to beat my expected Scissors\n   - If they play Paper, my Rock wins\n   - If they think like me and play Rock, we tie again\n\n[move] Rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Look at the sequence of ties:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - The pattern isn't perfectly cyclic, but there's clearly some underlying logic we're both following\n\n4. Consider the psychological game:\n   - We're both trying to predict each other\n   - When prediction methods are similar, ties become frequent\n   - Each tie gives information but also maintains the stalemate\n\n5. Strategic insight:\n   - To break this pattern, I need to think differently than they expect\n   - They might expect me to continue trying to predict their next move\n   - Or they might expect me to try something \"random\"\n\n6. Think about what they might predict I'll do:\n   - We just tied on Paper\n   - They might think I'll:\n     a) Move to Rock (next in a cycle)\n     b) Try Scissors (to counter if they stick with Paper)\n     c) Stay with Paper (if I think they'll change)\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - I'll go with Rock\n   - If they expect me to cycle through moves, they might play Paper to beat my expected Scissors\n   - If they play Paper, my Rock wins\n   - If they think like me and play Rock, we tie again\n\n[move] Rock",

Review the recent tie pattern:\n   - Round 16: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: both paper (tie)\n   - Round 19: both rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 23: both paper (tie)\n   - Current total: +1 points\n\n2. Analyze the tie sequence:\n   - We're consistently making the same moves\n   - This suggests we're either:\n     a) Using very similar prediction strategies\n     b) One of us is copying/mirroring the other\n     c) We're both following similar logical patterns\n\n3. Look at the specific tie moves:\n   - Scissors (\u00d73), Paper (\u00d72), Rock (\u00d71)\n   - Scissors seems to be the most common tie\n   - We just tied on Paper after tying on Scissors\n\n4. Consider the psychological aspect:\n   - With so many ties, we might both be trying to break the pattern\n   - The move that hasn't tied as much is Rock (only once)\n   - We might both be thinking \"let's try Rock to break the ties\"\n\n5. Predict their likely thinking:\n   - After tying on Paper, they might think:\n     a) \"Let's try Rock since we haven't tied on that as much\"\n     b) \"They'll expect me to change, so I'll stick with Paper\"\n     c) \"Let's go to Scissors since that's been our most common tie\"\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they think like me and choose Rock: we tie again\n   - If they stick with Paper: I should play Scissors to win\n   - If they go to Scissors: I should play Rock to win\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - I think they're most likely to try Rock (to break the paper tie pattern)\n   - But if we both think that way, we'll tie on Rock again\n   - I'll try Scissors instead - it beats Rock and we've tied on it before, so it might be unexpected\n\n[move] Scissors",
