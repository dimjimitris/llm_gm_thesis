    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels \"strong\" or \"solid\"\n   - Rock is often the most intuitive first choice for inexperienced players\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they choose rock (likely), I should choose paper to win\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points\n   - This seems like the highest probability winning move against a fresh player\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Choose paper as my opening move to counter the likely rock choice\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the tie sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This follows the exact sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - We're both cycling through the moves in the same order!\n\n3. Identify the pattern:\n   - It appears we're both following the cycle: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 (repeat)\n   - Round 16: Scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: Paper (tie) \n   - Round 19: Rock (tie)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (tie, back to start of cycle)\n\n4. Predict what's happening:\n   - We're both using the same cyclic strategy\n   - Next in the cycle should be Paper\n   - If we both follow this pattern, we'll tie again on Paper\n\n5. Strategic decision - break the cycle:\n   - To win, I need to deviate from this Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock cycle\n   - If they play Paper next (following the cycle), I should play Rock to beat Paper\n   - If they also try to break the cycle, it becomes unpredictable\n\n6. Consider their likely move:\n   - If they're aware of the cycle (like I am), they might:\n     a) Continue with Paper (next in cycle)\n     b) Try to break it by playing something else\n     c) Try to counter-predict my break attempt\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - I'll assume they'll continue the cycle with Paper\n   - I'll play Rock to beat Paper and finally win a round\n\n[move] Rock"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - This confirms they were following the Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock cycle\n   - Current total: +1 points\n\n2.

Predict their next move:\n   - Following the established cycle: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 (repeat)\n   - They just played Paper, so next should be Rock\n   - The cycle continues: Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play Rock (next in their cycle): I should play Scissors to beat Rock\n   - This would give me another win (+1 points)\n\n5.

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: both played scissors (tie)\n   - I expected them to play Rock (continuing their cycle), but they played Scissors\n   - This means they either broke their cycle or I misunderstood their pattern\n   - Current total: +1 points\n\n2. Re-analyze their recent sequence:\n   - Round 18: paper, Round 19: rock, Round 20: scissors, Round 21: paper, Round 22: scissors\n   - Looking at this: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Maybe their cycle isn't Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, but something else\n\n3. Look for alternative patterns:\n   - Could be: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - Or maybe they adapted after I won in round 21\n   - They might have switched strategies when they realized I predicted their cycle\n\n4. Consider what they might be thinking:\n   - After I won round 21 by playing Rock vs their Paper, they know I figured something out\n   - They might be trying to counter-predict my moves now\n   - Playing Scissors when I expected them to play Rock suggests they're adapting\n\n5. Analyze the tie pattern return:\n   - We're back to tying after I briefly broke the pattern\n   - They might be trying to mirror my moves again\n   - Or they predicted I'd play Scissors to beat their expected Rock\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - With their pattern broken and strategy potentially shifted, this is harder\n   - Last move was Scissors, so if they're cycling through moves: next could be Paper or Rock\n   - If they're trying to counter-predict me, they might play what beats what they think I'll play\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - Given the uncertainty, I'll try Paper\n   - If they play Scissors (repeating), I lose\n   - If they play Rock (cycling forward), I win\n   - If they play Paper (copying me), we tie\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze what's happening:\n   - We keep converging on the same moves despite strategy changes\n   - This suggests we might be using similar prediction logic\n   - Or one of us is successfully mirroring the other's thought process\n\n3. Look at the sequence of ties:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - The pattern isn't perfectly cyclic, but there's clearly some underlying logic we're both following\n\n4. Consider the psychological game:\n   - We're both trying to predict each other\n   - When prediction methods are similar, ties become frequent\n   - Each tie gives information but also maintains the stalemate\n\n5.
