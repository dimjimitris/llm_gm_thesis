They just played scissors twice in a row again. I keep making the wrong counter-move. Let me be very clear about the rules: scissors beats rock (as I just lost with rock against scissors), so to beat scissors I need paper. They seem to be playing scissors more frequently in recent rounds.\n\n[move] (Two scissors in a row - paper beats scissors) paper"
