Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\")\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since many new players default to rock on their first move\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best expected value against a beginner\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice to counter the most likely beginner move (rock)\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - which is fair odds\n\n[move] Paper"

Look for strong patterns:\n   - After Paper: they went Scissors (round 3\u21924), Rock (round 7\u21928), Rock (round 9\u219210)\n   - After Rock: they went Scissors (rounds 1\u21922, 5\u21926), Paper (round 8\u21929) \n   - Pattern after rock: Scissors, Scissors, Paper - so they've gone to scissors twice after rock\n   - Most recent pattern shows they favor rock, especially after paper\n\n4. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They're alternating between paper and rock recently\n   - After rock, historically they've gone to scissors 2 out of 3 times\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they follow their historical pattern after rock and play scissors: I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - If they continue the recent rock trend: I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - Given their historical tendency to play scissors after rock (2 out of 3 times), paper is the best choice\n\n[move] Paper"

Decision reasoning:\n   - The pairs pattern strongly suggests paper is next\n   - I've won 3 rounds in a row by following this pattern\n   - Even if they break the pattern, scissors beats both rock and paper\n   - Scissors is the optimal choice for the expected paper or potential rock\n\n[move] Scissors",

Consider their strategic behavior:\n   - They've been adapting well, but also showing some pattern tendencies\n   - The pairs pattern seems deliberate\n   - I've successfully predicted their last move (rock) with scissors\n   - They might continue the pairs pattern or break it since I countered it\n\n4. Evaluate potential next moves:\n   - If they complete the Rock-Rock pair: I should play scissors again (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they break the pattern and switch: could be scissors or paper\n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - The pairs pattern has been consistent for their last 5 moves\n   - They've invested in this pattern, so they might complete Rock-Rock\n   - But they also might realize I've caught onto the pattern and switch\n   - However, patterns can be psychologically compelling to maintain\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The evidence strongly suggests they'll complete Rock-Rock\n   - I just successfully used scissors against rock\n   - They might stick with rock to complete the pair despite my counter\n   - Scissors is the logical choice to exploit their likely second rock\n\n[move] Scissors",

Predict their next move:\n   - Following the pairs pattern, they should play scissors again\n   - This would complete the Scissors-Scissors pair\n   - The cycle is: Paper-Paper \u2192 Scissors-Scissors \u2192 Rock-Rock \u2192 (repeat)\n\n4. Verify my pattern understanding:\n   - Round 20-21: Paper-Paper \u2713\n   - Round 22: Scissors (first of pair) \u2713\n   - Round 23 should be: Scissors (second of pair)\n   - Then Round 24 would start Rock-Rock\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again (highly likely): I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n   - If they break pattern and play rock: I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they break pattern and play paper: I should play rock (rock beats paper)\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The pairs pattern has been consistent for 9 moves now\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds by following this pattern\n   - They should complete the Scissors-Scissors pair\n   - Paper beats scissors, so paper is the optimal choice\n\n[move] Paper",
