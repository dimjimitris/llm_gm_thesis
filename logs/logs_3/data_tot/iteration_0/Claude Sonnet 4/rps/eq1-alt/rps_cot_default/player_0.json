    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\")\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since many new players default to rock on their first move\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best expected value against a beginner\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice to counter the most likely beginner move (rock)\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - which is fair odds\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose rock in the first round\n   - This could be random, or they might favor rock\n   - I need to consider if they'll stick with rock or switch\n\n4.

Analyze the confirmed pairs pattern:\n   - Last 6 moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - The pairs pattern is now fully confirmed!\n   - They're playing each move twice in sequence\n   - Paper-Paper, then Scissors-Scissors, then Rock-Rock\n\n3. Predict their next move based on pattern:\n   - They've completed: Paper-Paper, Scissors-Scissors, Rock-Rock\n   - If the pattern continues, they should cycle back to the beginning\n   - Next should be Paper (starting a new Paper-Paper pair)\n   - This would make sense as a strategic cycling pattern\n\n4. Consider pattern reliability:\n   - I've successfully predicted their last 2 moves using this pairs analysis\n   - The pattern has been consistent for 6 moves now\n   - They might stick with it since it's somewhat unpredictable while having structure\n   - Or they might break it since I've been countering successfully\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they start Paper-Paper (most likely): I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - If they break pattern and play rock: I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they break pattern and play scissors: I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n6. Decision reasoning:\n   - The pairs pattern strongly suggests paper is next\n   - I've won 3 rounds in a row by following this pattern\n   - Even if they break the pattern, scissors beats both rock and paper\n   - Scissors is the optimal choice for the expected paper or potential rock\n\n[move] Scissors"
