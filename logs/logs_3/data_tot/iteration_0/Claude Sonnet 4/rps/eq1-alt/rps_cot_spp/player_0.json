    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider opponent's possible strategy:\n   - They might have noticed I've been very successful and are trying to break predictable patterns\n   - Repeating scissors could be intentional to throw me off\n   - They might switch to rock next to beat my potentially repeated paper\n   - Or they could continue with scissors if they think I'll switch\n\n5.

            "text": "I need to analyze this consistent pattern and plan for round 21.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the current game status:\n   - Previous score: +6 points\n   - Round 20 result: +1 point\n   - Current score: +7 points\n   - I correctly predicted scissors again and beat it with paper\n\n2. Re-examine opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: rock (strategic counter)\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 11 out of the last 12 rounds\n\n3. Confirm the overwhelming behavioral pattern:\n   - The opponent has an incredibly consistent scissors preference\n   - Only 1 deviation (strategic rock) in the last 12 rounds\n   - They continue playing scissors even after multiple losses to my paper\n   - This is now beyond statistical coincidence - it's a clear strategic or psychological preference\n\n4. Consider the strength of this pattern:\n   - I've beaten their scissors with paper four times recently (rounds 13, 15, 18, 20)\n   - They've only made one strategic counter-move (round 16 rock) despite these losses\n   - The pattern is so strong that they seem willing to accept losses rather than change\n   - This suggests deep commitment to scissors as their primary strategy\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 21:\n   - With 11 scissors in the last 12 rounds, this is the most predictable pattern I've ever seen\n   - They've demonstrated they rarely deviate from scissors even when consistently beaten\n   - The evidence strongly suggests they'll play scissors again\n   - I should continue with paper to beat their highly predictable scissors choice\n   - At this point, betting against scissors would be ignoring overwhelming evidence\n\n[move] (Pattern is now 11 scissors in last 12 rounds, continuing with paper to beat their consistent scissors choice) paper"

Re-examine opponent's recent sequence and strategic timing:\n   - Round 16: rock (after I beat scissors twice with paper in rounds 13, 15)\n   - Round 17-20: returned to scissors for 4 rounds\n   - Round 21: rock (after I beat scissors twice more with paper in rounds 18, 20)\n   - Pattern: They make strategic rock counters after I beat their scissors twice consecutively\n\n3. Identify their adaptive strategy:\n   - They have a strong scissors preference as their default\n   - But they strategically switch to rock when I exploit scissors too successfully\n   - The timing is consistent: rock counter after 2 consecutive paper victories over scissors\n   - Then they return to scissors after the rock counter\n\n4. Predict their likely behavior for round 22:\n   - Following their established pattern, they should return to scissors after the strategic rock\n   - Round 16 (rock) was followed by immediate return to scissors in round 17\n   - Round 21 (rock) should be followed by scissors in round 22\n   - Their default preference strongly pulls them back to scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 22:\n   - Based on their pattern, they should return to scissors after their strategic rock counter\n   - They've shown they use rock as a temporary tactical adjustment, not a permanent change\n   - I should play paper to beat their expected return to scissors\n   - This follows their demonstrated behavior pattern from rounds 16-17\n\n[move] (Following their pattern of returning to scissors after strategic rock counters, expecting scissors) paper"

Analyze the current game status:\n   - Previous score: +6 points\n   - Round 22 result: +1 point\n   - Current score: +7 points\n   - They returned to scissors exactly as predicted after their strategic rock counter\n\n2. Re-examine their confirmed strategic pattern:\n   - Round 16: rock (strategic counter after 2 paper wins)\n   - Round 17: scissors (immediate return to preference)\n   - Round 21: rock (strategic counter after 2 more paper wins)\n   - Round 22: scissors (immediate return to preference again)\n   - This confirms their tactical approach: temporary rock counters, then back to scissors\n\n3. Understand their established behavior cycle:\n   - Default: scissors (overwhelming preference)\n   - Strategic adjustment: rock when I beat scissors twice consecutively\n   - Reset: immediate return to scissors after rock counter\n   - They're predictable in both their preference and their counter-strategy\n\n4. Consider the current situation:\n   - I just beat their scissors with paper in round 22 (first time after their rock counter)\n   - If they follow their pattern, they'll likely continue with scissors until I beat it twice consecutively again\n   - They seem comfortable with occasional losses to paper as long as they can play their preferred scissors\n   - The next strategic rock counter shouldn't come until after another paper victory\n\n5. Strategic decision for round 23:\n   - Based on their pattern, they should continue with scissors\n   - They only make rock counters after I beat scissors twice in a row\n   - Since I only beat scissors once since their last rock counter (round 22), they should stick with scissors\n   - I'll play paper to beat their expected scissors choice\n\n[move] (They just returned to scissors and should continue until I beat it twice consecutively again) paper"
