    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They switched from their rock streak to paper in round 21, just when I switched to scissors. This could be:\n1. Coincidence\n2. They're adapting to counter my expected moves\n3. They're mixing their strategy more\n\nAfter three consecutive rocks, they played paper. They might:\n1. Return to rock (their most frequent choice)\n2. Continue with paper\n3. Try scissors\n\nGiven that they just successfully countered my scissors with paper, and considering rock is still their most frequent choice, I'll go with paper to beat rock if they return to it.\n\n[move] paper"
