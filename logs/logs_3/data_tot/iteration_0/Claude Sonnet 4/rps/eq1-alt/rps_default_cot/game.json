I played rock and they played scissors - rock should beat scissors according to the game rules, but it's being reported as a loss for me. My total score is now -2 points.\n\nThis has happened multiple times where rock vs scissors gives me a loss instead of a win. I'll continue playing but note this inconsistency.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: I played rock, they played paper\n- Round 2: I played paper, they played scissors  \n- Round 3: I played paper, they played rock\n- Round 4: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: I played rock, they played paper\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- Round 7: I played rock, they played scissors (reported as my loss)\n- Round 8: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 9: I played paper, they played rock\n- Round 10: I played paper, they played scissors\n- Round 11: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 12: I played rock, they played paper\n- Round 13: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 14: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n- Round 15: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 16: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n- Round 17: I played rock, they played scissors (reported as my loss)\n- Round 18: I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n- Round 19: I played paper, they played rock\n- Round 20: I played paper, they played rock\n- Round 21: I played scissors, they played paper\n- Round 22: I played paper, they played scissors\n- Round 23: I played rock, they played scissors (reported as my loss)\n\nTheir sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\nCurrent count:\n- Scissors: 9 times (rounds 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 22, 23)\n- Rock: 9 times (rounds 3, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20)\n- Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 5, 12, 14, 21)\n\nThey played scissors twice in a row (rounds 22, 23). Scissors and rock are now tied as their most frequent choices.\n\nGiven the pattern and that they seem to favor scissors recently, I'll try paper to beat rock if they switch back to it, since paper has been working better for me in actual wins.\n\n[move] paper",
