Consider why they switched to paper:\n   - They might have expected me to counter their scissors with paper\n   - By playing paper themselves, they avoided losing and created a tie\n   - This could indicate they're becoming more defensive/conservative\n   - Or they're trying to break the predictable reactive pattern I was exploiting\n\n4.

Analyze the current tie:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie\n   - This is reminiscent of the four consecutive ties at the beginning\n   - They're either thinking along the same lines as me, or deliberately mirroring again\n   - My total score remains +1 point\n\n2.

Consider what this means strategically:\n   - They might be reverting to the early game strategy of creating ties\n   - Or they're genuinely thinking through similar logic to mine\n   - The timing suggests they may have recognized I was reading their reactive pattern\n   - Now they're either being more unpredictable or matching my reasoning\n\n4. Evaluate the psychological aspect:\n   - Two consecutive ties might frustrate both players\n   - They might expect me to break the pattern with an unexpected move\n   - Or they might think I'll continue trying to predict their \"alternating\" pattern\n   - The safest strategy for them might be to keep matching my logic\n\n5. Plan my next move:\n   - If they're truly mirroring my thinking, I need to think differently\n   - If they're following paper-scissors alternation, rock would be next\n   - If they expect me to counter with rock, they might play paper\n   - I'll break my own logical pattern and go with rock - either to beat scissors if they repeat, or to complete rock-paper-scissors if they're cycling\n\n[move] Rock",

Identify the key insight:\n   - My wins often come after periods of predictable patterns\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move (2 wins out of 3 uses)\n   - My opponent seems to struggle when I choose scissors unexpectedly\n\n4. Analyze my opponent's potential response:\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors\n   - Based on previous patterns, they usually counter-adapt after losses\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won)\n   - Or they might expect me to switch, knowing they'll counter-predict\n\n5. Consider the historical pattern after my wins:\n   - Round 5 win \u2192 Round 6 loss (they countered my repeated paper)\n   - Round 9 win \u2192 Round 10 loss (they countered my repeated scissors)\n   - They consistently punish me for repeating winning moves\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I repeat scissors: They'll likely choose rock to counter\n   - If I switch to rock: They might choose paper\n   - If I switch to paper: They might choose scissors\n\n7. Make my decision based on breaking the counter-pattern:\n   - Since they expect me to either repeat or predictably switch\n   - And they've been successful countering my post-win moves\n   - I'll choose paper - if they expect scissors repetition, they'll choose rock, and paper beats rock\n\n[move] (Breaking the pattern of repeating winning moves by switching to paper) paper"
