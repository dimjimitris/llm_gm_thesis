    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Develop strategy for round 2:\n   - The opponent showed they can think beyond just picking rock randomly\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies after the tie\n   - If they think I'll change from paper, they might stick with paper or switch to scissors\n   - If they switch from paper, they might go to rock or scissors\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Since they played paper last round, they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - But if they're thinking one level deeper, they might play rock to beat my potential scissors\n   - I'll play scissors to beat paper if they repeat, or to tie if they also switch to scissors\n   - This gives me the best chance against someone who might stick with their previous successful strategy\n\n[move] Scissors"

Review the recent exchanges:\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 22: I played paper, they played rock \u2192 I lost\n   - We're essentially trading the same moves but in reverse order\n   - This could be coincidence or they might be mirroring/countering systematically\n\n4. Assess the current situation:\n   - I'm back to -2 points\n   - My opponent seems to be staying one step ahead of my predictions\n   - I need to win rounds to recover, but my strategic thinking isn't working\n   - I should focus on simpler, less predictable choices\n\n5. Make a straightforward decision:\n   - They just played rock successfully\n   - They might repeat rock or switch to something else\n   - Instead of complex predictions, I'll choose based on covering multiple scenarios\n   - Scissors beats rock, ties with scissors, loses to paper\n   - I'll play scissors to beat rock if they repeat, or have decent odds otherwise\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "Another tie with scissors. This is the second time we've both played scissors recently.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the tie:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 tie\n   - This is the second scissors tie (Round 20 and now Round 23)\n   - My total score remains -2 points\n   - We're matching moves again, similar to earlier patterns\n\n2. Review the recent pattern:\n   - Round 20: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, they played paper \u2192 I won\n   - Round 22: I played paper, they played rock \u2192 I lost\n   - Round 23: Both played scissors (tie)\n   - There's a mix of ties and alternating wins/losses\n\n3. Consider what this scissors tie reveals:\n   - They chose scissors after playing rock successfully\n   - This suggests they're not just sticking with winning moves\n   - They might be thinking along similar lines to me again\n   - Or they predicted I would try scissors to counter their previous rock\n\n4. Evaluate my position:\n   - I'm still at -2 points and need to start winning consistently\n   - Ties don't help me catch up\n   - I need to break this pattern of matching moves\n   - My opponent seems comfortable with ties, but I need wins\n\n5. Plan a move to break the tie pattern:\n   - If they expect another tie or think I'll repeat scissors, they might play scissors again\n   - If they want to win after the tie, they might play rock (to beat scissors)\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper\n   - I'll play rock to beat scissors if they repeat, or to counter their most likely move\n\n[move] Rock"
