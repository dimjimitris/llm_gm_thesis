Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the best strategic choice:\n   - They just lost with rock, making it less likely they'll repeat\n   - Paper seems most probable as a counter to my winning scissors\n   - If they choose paper, scissors would win again\n   - Repeating my winning move might catch them trying to counter-predict\n\n[move] (Since my opponent might try paper to counter my winning scissors, I'll stick with scissors) scissors"

Analyze my opponent's likely mental state:\n   - Three consecutive losses is significant\n   - They might be panicking or desperately trying new strategies\n   - Their previous counter-prediction success has completely broken down\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - At +2 points, I have a comfortable buffer\n   - I could play conservatively (accept ties) to protect my lead\n   - Or continue aggressively to maximize points while momentum lasts\n\n7. Consider what they might expect:\n   - I just completed the full cycle: paper, scissors, rock\n   - They might expect me to restart the cycle with paper\n   - Or they might expect me to break the pattern entirely\n   - Their prediction ability seems compromised right now\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Since I just used rock and they chose paper, they might stick with paper or switch\n   - Scissors beats paper - if they repeat or expect me to repeat rock\n   - I'll capitalize on this momentum while they're still struggling to adapt\n\n[move] (Continuing the aggressive approach with scissors to beat their likely paper choice) scissors"

Consider what this tie means:\n   - My opponent chose scissors same as me\n   - Either they predicted my choice correctly, or they're back to mirroring\n   - This could be defensive play to stop my winning streak\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - At +2 points, I have a significant lead\n   - One tie doesn't hurt me - it just maintains my advantage\n   - My opponent needs to win points to catch up, ties don't help them\n\n5. Consider my opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They just stopped my winning streak with a tie\n   - They might feel more confident now\n   - They could return to their previous counter-prediction attempts\n   - Or they might stick with mirroring as a safe strategy\n\n6. Analyze the risk/reward:\n   - With a +2 lead, I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - Ties preserve my advantage while wins extend it\n   - I should avoid risky moves that could lead to losses\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Paper has been very successful for me historically\n   - If they're trying to mirror or predict, paper might catch them off-guard\n   - If they choose rock (thinking I'll avoid repeating scissors), paper wins\n   - This leverages one of my most reliable winning moves\n\n[move] (Using my historically successful paper to potentially extend my lead) paper"
