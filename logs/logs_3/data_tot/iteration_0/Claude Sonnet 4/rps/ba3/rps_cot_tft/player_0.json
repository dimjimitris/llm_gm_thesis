    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 vs -3  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 vs -1\n\n2. Key observation: Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) and highest penalty (-3 points). This makes paper vs rock the highest-stakes matchup.\n\n3. Consider the opponent: They are described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed sophisticated strategies yet. Fresh players often default to common choices.\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Rock is often a default choice for new players (it's the first option listed and feels \"strong\")\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I want to choose paper for the maximum +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Risk assessment: \n   - Playing paper gives me the chance for maximum gain (+3) if opponent plays rock\n   - The risk is losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - The potential reward outweighs the risk, especially against a fresh player who might default to rock\n\n6. Decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup and the likelihood that a fresh player might choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Gather information about opponent behavior:\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper\n   - This could indicate they anticipated I might play paper (strategic thinking)\n   - Or it could be coincidental\n\n3. Consider opponent's possible next move:\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to switch away from paper\n   - They might repeat scissors if they think it worked\n   - They might try rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n   - They might play paper, thinking I'll play rock\n\n4. Analyze my best counter-strategies:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning for this round:\n   - Playing rock covers me if they repeat scissors\n   - Rock also sets up a potential paper play from them, which I could counter next round\n   - Rock is a solid, lower-risk choice that avoids the -3 penalty\n\n6.
