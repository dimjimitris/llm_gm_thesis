Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any particular strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first instincts.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing paper could give me the maximum 3-point advantage. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst I can do is lose 1 point (if they choose scissors) or tie (if they also choose paper).\n\n[move] Paper"

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

My opponent has now played paper four times in a row (rounds 18-21), and I've successfully countered with scissors each time for +1 point.\n\nThe pattern shows:\n- Rounds 1-4: Scissors (4 times)\n- Rounds 5-10: Paper (6 times)\n- Rounds 11-13: Rock (3 times)\n- Rounds 14-17: Scissors (4 times)\n- Rounds 18-21: Paper (4 times so far)\n\nInteresting! They've now played paper for 4 rounds, which matches the length of their scissors streaks. Their previous paper streak was 6 rounds though, so they might continue for 2 more rounds to match that, or they might switch now after 4 rounds like they did with scissors.\n\nGiven the uncertainty but their demonstrated ability to play longer streaks (like the 6-round paper streak), I think they'll likely continue with paper for at least another round or two.\n\nScissors has been consistently profitable against their paper streak.\n\nIf they continue with paper: +1 point with scissors\nIf they switch to rock: -1 point with scissors\nIf they switch to scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nI'll stick with scissors to continue capitalizing on their paper streak.\n\n[move] Scissors",
