    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This makes paper a potentially strong choice if I can predict the opponent will play rock\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives the highest point value (+3)\n   - And new players frequently choose rock\n   - Playing paper maximizes my expected value\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n   - The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value win condition and the likelihood that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the opponent's evolving pattern:\n   - Opponent's sequence: scissors(4x), paper(2x), scissors, rock, scissors, rock\n   - They've now played rock twice in the last 3 rounds\n   - This suggests they're adapting to my tendency to play rock as a counter\n   - They might be anticipating my moves better now\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - Two consecutive ties with rock suggests they're predicting my rock plays\n   - They seem to be moving away from their early scissors dominance\n   - They're becoming more strategic and less predictable\n   - I'm still at -4 points and need to start winning\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock again: they might play paper (beats rock +3)\n   - If they think I'll switch from rock: they might return to scissors or stay with rock\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives +1 point\n   - Paper beats rock and gives +3 points (but risky if they play scissors)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they can anticipate rock plays\n   - They might expect me to continue with rock after two ties\n   - If they play paper (anticipating my rock), scissors would win +1\n   - If they play rock again, scissors loses -1\n   - This is a calculated risk to break the tie pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, betting that the opponent will play paper to counter my expected rock play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the concerning pattern:\n   - Last 3 rounds: all ties (rock-rock, rock-rock, scissors-scissors)\n   - The opponent is now matching my moves exactly\n   - This suggests they may be:\n     a) Reading my patterns very well\n     b) Using a strategy to mirror/predict my moves\n     c) Deliberately forcing ties to prevent me from scoring\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - Three consecutive ties means no points gained or lost recently\n   - I'm stuck at -4 points and need to break this tie pattern\n   - The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves successfully\n   - I need to become more unpredictable\n\n4. Consider next move options:\n   - If opponent expects me to continue the pattern and plays scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch and plays rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - Given the recent tie pattern, they might expect me to change tactics\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has been matching my moves, suggesting they're predicting well\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) and might be unexpected after scissors\n   - They might not expect me to go back to paper after it's been countered by scissors so often\n   - This is a calculated risk for maximum points\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially catch them off-guard and gain the valuable +3 points, breaking both the tie pattern and my losing streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the alarming pattern:\n   - 4 ties out of the last 5 rounds\n   - The opponent is matching my moves with incredible accuracy\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence\n   - They seem to be predicting or mirroring my strategy almost perfectly\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent has identified my decision-making patterns\n   - They might be using a strategy that anticipates common psychological reactions\n   - They could be deliberately forcing ties to maintain their advantage\n   - Or they're using some form of pattern recognition I haven't detected\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - My current approach is clearly being countered\n   - I need to break away from any predictable patterns\n   - The opponent expects me to cycle through moves or react predictably\n   - I should consider what they would LEAST expect\n\n5. Unconventional reasoning:\n   - Given they've been matching me so well, they might expect me to overthink\n   - Rock is the move I haven't played in the recent tie sequence (last played round 10)\n   - They might anticipate me avoiding rock since it tied twice earlier\n   - Sometimes the simplest, most \"obvious\" choice is actually unexpected when someone is overthinking\n   - Rock also counters scissors, which has been their historically most common move\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, as it's the move most absent from recent play and might catch them off-guard if they're expecting me to continue cycling or overthinking.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the current situation:\n   - Another scissors tie - this is the third scissors tie we've had\n   - Opponent went: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - They returned to scissors after successfully using paper to counter my rock\n   - They seem to default back to scissors when not actively countering\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely strategy:\n   - They just tied with scissors after their successful paper play\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to counter scissors) since it worked before\n   - Or they might think I'll avoid rock after the -3 loss and continue experimenting\n   - They could stick with scissors or switch anticipating my next move\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock wins (+1) - gets me back to even\n   - If opponent plays paper (expecting my rock): scissors wins (+1) \n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins (+3) - significant recovery\n   - I'm at -1 and need to get back to positive territory\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has a clear scissors preference (most common move)\n   - Rock has been my most successful counter to their scissors\n   - While they countered it once with paper, they've returned to scissors\n   - I shouldn't let one successful counter by them scare me away from a winning strategy\n   - Rock vs scissors gives me the reliable +1 I need to get back to even\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors play, aiming to get back to even score and rebuild from there.\n\n[move] rock"

Review recent performance:\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total score: 0 points (back to even)\n\n2. Analyze the confirmed pattern:\n   - I'm back to even score after the recovery\n   - Opponent returned to scissors after their paper experiment\n   - Rock vs scissors continues to be my most reliable winning combination\n   - Their sequence: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors - defaulting back to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost to rock again after returning to scissors\n   - This is now the third time rock has beaten their scissors in recent rounds\n   - They might finally abandon scissors more permanently\n   - If they expect another rock, they could counter with paper again (+3 for them)\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - The opponent has shown they can break patterns when I get predictable\n   - They successfully used paper to counter my rock streak before\n   - If they play paper (expecting rock): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: rock wins (+1) \n   - If they try rock: paper wins (+3)\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - I just got predictable with rock again and won, but they've shown they can counter this\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock since it just worked\n   - Scissors would counter their potential paper play (expecting my rock)\n   - This breaks my rock predictability while positioning for a win\n   - Even if they play rock, I only lose -1, which is manageable\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the possibility they'll use paper to counter my expected rock play, while avoiding being too predictable with rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Review recent performance:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n\n2. Analyze the scissors tie pattern:\n   - This is now the 4th scissors tie we've had throughout the game\n   - Opponent's recent sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They've returned strongly to scissors after the paper experiment\n   - Every time I play scissors, we tie - they seem to default to scissors frequently\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has a very strong scissors preference\n   - They only deviate from scissors when actively countering my patterns\n   - After ties, they tend to stick with scissors\n   - Rock has been consistently effective against their scissors preference\n\n4. Evaluate the situation:\n   - I'm at 0 points - neutral position\n   - If opponent plays scissors again (highly likely): rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper (expecting rock): I lose (-3)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - The probability heavily favors scissors based on their behavior\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown scissors is their comfort zone/default move\n   - They return to scissors after experiments or when uncertain\n   - Rock has been my most successful and reliable counter throughout the game\n   - While they might anticipate it, their pattern suggests they'll likely play scissors\n   - I need to capitalize on their predictable scissors tendency\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their highly probable scissors play, aiming to get back into positive territory with the reliable +1 point gain.\n\n[move] rock"

Review recent performance:\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze the strong pattern confirmation:\n   - I'm back in positive territory (+1)\n   - The rock vs scissors strategy continues to be highly effective\n   - Opponent has played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - They seem deeply committed to scissors as their primary strategy\n\n3. Consider the risk factors:\n   - I've now won twice with rock against their scissors recently\n   - This is creating a predictable pattern that they could exploit\n   - If they anticipate rock and play paper, I lose -3 points (major setback)\n   - However, their behavior suggests strong scissors preference regardless\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock wins (+1) - extends lead to +2\n   - If opponent plays paper (countering expected rock): I lose (-3) - drops me to -2\n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins (+3) - jumps me to +4\n   - The key question is whether they'll break their scissors pattern\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown incredible consistency with scissors\n   - Even when they've had opportunities to counter my rock, they often return to scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests scissors is either their preferred strategy or they're stuck in it\n   - While risky, the probability strongly favors another scissors play\n   - One more rock win would put me at +2, giving me a solid lead\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to capitalize on their persistent scissors pattern, accepting the risk but betting on their demonstrated behavior continuing.\n\n[move] rock"
