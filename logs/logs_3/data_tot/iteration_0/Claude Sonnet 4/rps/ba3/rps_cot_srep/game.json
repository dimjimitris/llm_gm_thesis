Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This makes paper a potentially strong choice if I can predict the opponent will play rock\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player\"\n   - Fresh/new players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"\n\n4. Formulate strategy:\n   - Since paper beats rock and gives the highest point value (+3)\n   - And new players frequently choose rock\n   - Playing paper maximizes my expected value\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n   - The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the high-value win condition and the likelihood that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the concerning pattern:\n   - Last 3 rounds: all ties (rock-rock, rock-rock, scissors-scissors)\n   - The opponent is now matching my moves exactly\n   - This suggests they may be:\n     a) Reading my patterns very well\n     b) Using a strategy to mirror/predict my moves\n     c) Deliberately forcing ties to prevent me from scoring\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - Three consecutive ties means no points gained or lost recently\n   - I'm stuck at -4 points and need to break this tie pattern\n   - The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves successfully\n   - I need to become more unpredictable\n\n4. Consider next move options:\n   - If opponent expects me to continue the pattern and plays scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch and plays rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - Given the recent tie pattern, they might expect me to change tactics\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has been matching my moves, suggesting they're predicting well\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) and might be unexpected after scissors\n   - They might not expect me to go back to paper after it's been countered by scissors so often\n   - This is a calculated risk for maximum points\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially catch them off-guard and gain the valuable +3 points, breaking both the tie pattern and my losing streak.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the alarming pattern:\n   - 4 ties out of the last 5 rounds\n   - The opponent is matching my moves with incredible accuracy\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence\n   - They seem to be predicting or mirroring my strategy almost perfectly\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent has identified my decision-making patterns\n   - They might be using a strategy that anticipates common psychological reactions\n   - They could be deliberately forcing ties to maintain their advantage\n   - Or they're using some form of pattern recognition I haven't detected\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - My current approach is clearly being countered\n   - I need to break away from any predictable patterns\n   - The opponent expects me to cycle through moves or react predictably\n   - I should consider what they would LEAST expect\n\n5. Unconventional reasoning:\n   - Given they've been matching me so well, they might expect me to overthink\n   - Rock is the move I haven't played in the recent tie sequence (last played round 10)\n   - They might anticipate me avoiding rock since it tied twice earlier\n   - Sometimes the simplest, most \"obvious\" choice is actually unexpected when someone is overthinking\n   - Rock also counters scissors, which has been their historically most common move\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, as it's the move most absent from recent play and might catch them off-guard if they're expecting me to continue cycling or overthinking.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I finally broke the tie streak and won a round!\n   - The opponent went back to scissors after the tie pattern\n   - This suggests they may have been forcing ties deliberately, but returned to their preferred move\n   - Rock beating scissors got me back on track\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost after a series of successful ties/wins\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since it just worked\n   - If they anticipate rock, they might play paper to counter it (-3 points for me)\n   - Or they might return to their historical pattern behavior\n   - They could also stick with scissors, not expecting me to repeat rock\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - I just won with rock, so they may expect me to repeat it\n   - Paper beats rock and gives them +3 if they predict correctly\n   - But scissors has been their most common move historically\n   - If they stick with scissors again, rock would win again (+1)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock again: High risk if they counter with paper (-3), but +1 if they repeat scissors\n   - Playing paper: +3 if they play rock, -1 if they play scissors\n   - Playing scissors: +1 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock\n   - Given their tendency toward scissors, rock seems reasonable but predictable\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the possibility they'll switch to rock (expecting me to repeat rock), while also positioning for the high-value +3 win.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the scissors tie pattern:\n   - This is now the 4th scissors tie we've had throughout the game\n   - Opponent's recent sequence: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They've returned strongly to scissors after the paper experiment\n   - Every time I play scissors, we tie - they seem to default to scissors frequently\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - The opponent has a very strong scissors preference\n   - They only deviate from scissors when actively countering my patterns\n   - After ties, they tend to stick with scissors\n   - Rock has been consistently effective against their scissors preference\n\n4. Evaluate the situation:\n   - I'm at 0 points - neutral position\n   - If opponent plays scissors again (highly likely): rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent switches to paper (expecting rock): I lose (-3)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - The probability heavily favors scissors based on their behavior\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown scissors is their comfort zone/default move\n   - They return to scissors after experiments or when uncertain\n   - Rock has been my most successful and reliable counter throughout the game\n   - While they might anticipate it, their pattern suggests they'll likely play scissors\n   - I need to capitalize on their predictable scissors tendency\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their highly probable scissors play, aiming to get back into positive territory with the reliable +1 point gain.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the concerning pattern:\n   - Last 3 rounds: all ties (rock-rock, rock-rock, scissors-scissors)\n   - The opponent is now matching my moves exactly\n   - This suggests they may be:\n     a) Reading my patterns very well\n     b) Using a strategy to mirror/predict my moves\n     c) Deliberately forcing ties to prevent me from scoring\n\n3. Strategic implications:\n   - Three consecutive ties means no points gained or lost recently\n   - I'm stuck at -4 points and need to break this tie pattern\n   - The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves successfully\n   - I need to become more unpredictable\n\n4. Consider next move options:\n   - If opponent expects me to continue the pattern and plays scissors: rock wins (+1)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch and plays rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - Given the recent tie pattern, they might expect me to change tactics\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has been matching my moves, suggesting they're predicting well\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) and might be unexpected after scissors\n   - They might not expect me to go back to paper after it's been countered by scissors so often\n   - This is a calculated risk for maximum points\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially catch them off-guard and gain the valuable +3 points, breaking both the tie pattern and my losing streak.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze the alarming pattern:\n   - 4 ties out of the last 5 rounds\n   - The opponent is matching my moves with incredible accuracy\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence\n   - They seem to be predicting or mirroring my strategy almost perfectly\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent has identified my decision-making patterns\n   - They might be using a strategy that anticipates common psychological reactions\n   - They could be deliberately forcing ties to maintain their advantage\n   - Or they're using some form of pattern recognition I haven't detected\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - My current approach is clearly being countered\n   - I need to break away from any predictable patterns\n   - The opponent expects me to cycle through moves or react predictably\n   - I should consider what they would LEAST expect\n\n5. Unconventional reasoning:\n   - Given they've been matching me so well, they might expect me to overthink\n   - Rock is the move I haven't played in the recent tie sequence (last played round 10)\n   - They might anticipate me avoiding rock since it tied twice earlier\n   - Sometimes the simplest, most \"obvious\" choice is actually unexpected when someone is overthinking\n   - Rock also counters scissors, which has been their historically most common move\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, as it's the move most absent from recent play and might catch them off-guard if they're expecting me to continue cycling or overthinking.\n\n[move] rock",

Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown incredible consistency with scissors\n   - Even when they've had opportunities to counter my rock, they often return to scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests scissors is either their preferred strategy or they're stuck in it\n   - While risky, the probability strongly favors another scissors play\n   - One more rock win would put me at +2, giving me a solid lead\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to capitalize on their persistent scissors pattern, accepting the risk but betting on their demonstrated behavior continuing.\n\n[move] rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock has beaten scissors twice when I played it\n   - The pattern is so established that deviating seems unnecessary\n   - Even if they're planning to switch, rock still beats scissors if they don't\n   - The risk-reward heavily favors continuing to play rock\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Four consecutive scissors plays establishes a very reliable pattern\n   - Rock consistently counters scissors for +1 point\n   - Until they demonstrate they will change, I should exploit this pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to counter the established scissors pattern. The consistency is too strong to ignore.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider the scissors dominance:\n   - Rock beats scissors and gives +1 point\n   - Given scissors is their most frequent move (6/9 times)\n   - And they just played scissors again after the rock experiment\n   - They might continue with scissors, especially if they expect me to avoid paper\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to recover from my -4 score\n   - Rock consistently beats their most common move (scissors)\n   - I should avoid paper since they always counter it with scissors\n   - Playing rock gives me the best odds against their preferred scissors strategy\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their scissors-heavy strategy and start recovering points.\n\n[move] rock",

Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent seems to be anticipating my moves somehow\n   - I should avoid paper since it gets countered 100% of the time\n   - Rock vs scissors has been my most successful matchup historically\n   - Given they just played scissors, they might continue or switch\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Playing rock has worked well against their scissors in the past\n   - They just played scissors, so rock would counter it\n   - I need to avoid paper at all costs given the perfect counter-rate\n   - Rock gives me the best historical success rate\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter scissors, avoiding paper which has been perfectly countered every single time.\n\n[move] rock",

Counter-strategy decision:\n   - I need to break their prediction pattern\n   - Paper is the move I haven't played since round 9 (2 rounds ago)\n   - If they expect rock or scissors, paper could catch them off-guard\n   - If they play rock (expecting me to play rock), paper wins +3 points\n   - If they play scissors (their frequent choice), I lose -1\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to break the prediction pattern and potentially catch them anticipating rock or scissors, seeking the high-value +3 win.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze the striking pattern of recent moves:\n   - Last 3 rounds: rock/rock (tie), rock/rock (tie), scissors/scissors (tie)\n   - The opponent is now matching my moves exactly\n   - This suggests they're either:\n     a) Deliberately mirroring my strategy\n     b) Thinking through the same logic I am\n     c) Trying to neutralize the game with ties\n\n3. Consider the implications:\n   - Three consecutive ties means neither player is gaining advantage\n   - The opponent may be intentionally creating ties to prevent me from recovering\n   - Or they're genuinely predicting my exact thought process\n   - This level of synchronization is remarkable\n\n4. Strategic breakthrough needed:\n   - If opponent continues mirroring, I need to think one level deeper\n   - They might expect me to recognize the mirroring pattern\n   - If they think I'll try to counter the mirroring, they might switch strategies\n   - I need to break this cycle to start winning rounds\n\n5. Meta-strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper beats rock and gives the highest reward (+3)\n   - If opponent expects me to continue the rock/scissors pattern, they might play rock\n   - Or if they recognize I might switch to paper, they might play scissors\n   - Given the mirroring pattern, they might expect me to play paper and counter with scissors\n\nFinal decision: Play rock. If they're truly mirroring perfectly, we'll tie again. But if they're trying to counter my expected pattern break to paper, rock beats scissors. This also tests whether the mirroring is intentional or coincidental.\n\n[move] rock",

Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock wins (+1) - continuing the successful pattern\n   - If opponent switches to paper (countering expected rock): I lose (-3)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3)\n   - The risk/reward calculation: high probability +1 vs low probability -3\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm in a strong position (+2 points) with a clear winning pattern\n   - The opponent has shown remarkable consistency with scissors\n   - While they might adapt, their behavior suggests strong scissors preference\n   - Rock has been my most reliable winning move against this opponent\n   - Maintaining the successful strategy seems optimal unless they prove they've adapted\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to capitalize on the opponent's apparent scissors preference, continuing the proven winning pattern.\n\n[move] rock",

Review recent performance:\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze the strong pattern confirmation:\n   - I'm back in positive territory (+1 point)\n   - The opponent has now played scissors in 4 consecutive rounds\n   - Every rock vs scissors matchup has given me +1 point\n   - Every scissors vs scissors has been a tie\n   - They seem extremely committed to scissors\n\n3. Consider the risk/reward dynamics:\n   - The opponent might finally break this scissors pattern after multiple losses\n   - If they expect rock again, paper would counter me for -3 points\n   - But their behavior suggests they're either stuck in scissors pattern or prefer it strongly\n   - This could be their consistent strategy rather than adaptable play\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent continues scissors: rock wins (+1) again\n   - If opponent switches to paper (countering expected rock): major loss (-3)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: paper wins (+3) - significant gain\n   - The pattern suggests scissors is most likely, but the risk is high if I'm wrong\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - I'm ahead +1 and should consider preserving/building this lead carefully\n   - The opponent has shown incredible commitment to scissors (4 straight rounds)\n   - While risky, rock has been extremely reliable against their scissors preference\n   - Their pattern suggests they may continue with scissors despite losses\n   - Even if they counter once with paper, I can adjust for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to capitalize on their apparent scissors fixation, accepting the risk for the likely +1 point gain.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze the strong pattern confirmation:\n   - I'm back in positive territory (+1)\n   - The rock vs scissors strategy continues to be highly effective\n   - Opponent has played scissors in 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - They seem deeply committed to scissors as their primary strategy\n\n3. Consider the risk factors:\n   - I've now won twice with rock against their scissors recently\n   - This is creating a predictable pattern that they could exploit\n   - If they anticipate rock and play paper, I lose -3 points (major setback)\n   - However, their behavior suggests strong scissors preference regardless\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: rock wins (+1) - extends lead to +2\n   - If opponent plays paper (countering expected rock): I lose (-3) - drops me to -2\n   - If opponent plays rock: paper wins (+3) - jumps me to +4\n   - The key question is whether they'll break their scissors pattern\n\n5. Decision reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown incredible consistency with scissors\n   - Even when they've had opportunities to counter my rock, they often return to scissors\n   - Their pattern suggests scissors is either their preferred strategy or they're stuck in it\n   - While risky, the probability strongly favors another scissors play\n   - One more rock win would put me at +2, giving me a solid lead\n\nFinal decision: Play rock again to capitalize on their persistent scissors pattern, accepting the risk but betting on their demonstrated behavior continuing.\n\n[move] rock",
