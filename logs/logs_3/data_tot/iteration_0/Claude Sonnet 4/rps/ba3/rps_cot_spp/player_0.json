Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Key observation: Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), while the other matchups only have +1/-1. This makes paper a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically associated with strength\n   - They may not immediately notice the asymmetric payoff structure\n   - They're likely to play somewhat randomly or predictably\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If the opponent plays rock (likely for a fresh player), I want to play paper for the +3 points\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors for +1 point\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock for +1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (vs rock), worst case -1 (vs scissors), tie case 0 (vs paper)\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1 (vs scissors), worst case -3 (vs paper), tie case 0 (vs rock)\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (vs paper), worst case -1 (vs rock), tie case 0 (vs scissors)\n\n6.

Analyze the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points each)\n   - This means the opponent also recognized paper as a strong choice, or got lucky\n   - The opponent is not as predictable as a typical \"fresh player\" might be\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They either thought similar to me (paper beats rock, high payoff)\n   - Or they're playing more strategically than expected\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper since it has the highest potential payoff\n\n3. Counter-strategy considerations:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll play paper again, they might play scissors to counter me\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch away from paper, they might play rock expecting me to avoid the high-risk paper\n   - The opponent showed they're willing to take the high-risk paper play\n\n4. Game theory analysis:\n   - If both players recognize paper's high value, we might both gravitate toward it\n   - But if I expect them to play paper again, I should play scissors for +1\n   - If I expect them to expect me to counter with scissors, they might play rock\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper again\n\n5. Risk assessment for this round:\n   - Playing scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Playing paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Playing rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n\n6. Decision: Since the opponent already showed they're willing to play paper, and they might stick with it or expect me to counter, I'll play scissors to counter a potential paper repeat.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the opponent's likely paper choice.\n\n[move] Scissors"

What worked in round 9:\n   - I played paper and they played rock\n   - This gave me the maximum possible reward (+3)\n   - My risk management approach paid off\n\n4. Opponent pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to cycle through moves rather than stick with one\n   - After scissors in round 8, they went to rock in round 9\n   - They might continue this switching pattern\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just played rock, so they might switch away from it\n   - If they expect me to repeat paper (since it just worked), they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll avoid repeating, they might play rock again or paper\n   - The key is not being too predictable after a success\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - I shouldn't assume they'll repeat rock just because I won\n   - They might expect me to repeat paper since it just gave me +3\n   - If they counter with scissors, I lose only -1 (manageable)\n   - If they switch to paper or rock, I could tie or win again\n   - But playing scissors might be safer - it beats paper if they switch, and only loses -1 to rock\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential paper switch while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Recent opponent moves (last 3 rounds):\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock  \n   - Round 10: paper\n   - They just completed a full cycle: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n3. What's working for me:\n   - I stopped overthinking and focused on practical counters\n   - Round 9: Played paper, correctly anticipated rock\n   - Round 10: Played scissors, correctly anticipated paper switch\n   - I'm successfully predicting their move transitions\n\n4. Opponent pattern recognition:\n   - They appear to be cycling through all three moves\n   - After completing scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, they might:\n     - Start the cycle over with scissors\n     - Continue in some other pattern\n     - Try to break their own predictability\n\n5. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they repeat the cycle and play scissors next, I should play rock\n   - Rock vs scissors gives me +1 point (safe, positive outcome)\n   - Even if they don't play scissors, rock only risks -3 vs paper (but they just played paper)\n   - The cycle pattern suggests scissors is most likely next\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n   - Given they just played paper and the cycle pattern, scissors seems most probable\n   - This is a calculated risk with good odds\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the expected scissors in their cycle pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

Why this pattern makes sense:\n   - They might be using a simple rotation strategy\n   - Each move counters what would counter the previous move in sequence\n   - This gives them a predictable but seemingly random approach\n\n5.

Performance trend analysis:\n   - My mixed strategy approach is preventing catastrophic losses\n   - I'm getting a mix of wins, ties, and small losses instead of being consistently exploited\n   - This is progress even though I just lost\n   - The -1 loss is much more manageable than the -3 losses I was taking\n\n3. Opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: paper  \n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - They're continuing to vary their moves unpredictably\n\n4. Key insight:\n   - Neither of us is establishing a clear pattern anymore\n   - This suggests we're both playing more strategically/randomly\n   - The game has become more balanced\n   - I should stick with the mixed strategy that's working\n\n5. Decision principles:\n   - Continue avoiding predictable patterns\n   - Don't react specifically to their last move (scissors)\n   - Focus on expected value across all possibilities\n   - Maintain variety in my own play\n\n6. Move selection:\n   - I've played scissors, then paper in the last two rounds\n   - Rock would complete the variety and maintain unpredictability\n   - Rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n   - The -3 risk is concerning, but I need to play all moves to stay unpredictable\n   - Mixed strategy requires using all options\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to complete the mixed strategy variety and maintain unpredictability.\n\n[move] Rock"

Strategic assessment:\n   - My mixed strategy is working - I'm not being systematically exploited\n   - The opponent can't easily predict my moves anymore\n   - We're both playing more unpredictably, leading to more ties\n   - This is a much healthier game state than the pattern-exploitation phases\n\n4. Mixed strategy effectiveness:\n   - I've now played all three moves recently: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - The variety is preventing the opponent from adapting to counter me\n   - Ties are better than consistent losses\n   - I should continue this approach\n\n5. Decision for round 21:\n   - Continue the mixed strategy approach\n   - I just played rock, so switching maintains unpredictability\n   - Consider the expected values without overthinking patterns\n   - Paper: +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper\n   - Scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n\n6. Choice rationale:\n   - I'll go with scissors this round\n   - It's different from my last move (rock)\n   - Has reasonable risk/reward profile\n   - Continues the mixed strategy that's preventing exploitation\n   - Keeps the opponent guessing\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to maintain the mixed strategy approach that's working.\n\n[move] Scissors"
