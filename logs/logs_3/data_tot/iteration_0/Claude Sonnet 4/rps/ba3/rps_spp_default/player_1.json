    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have established patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices. Many new players tend to start with rock as it feels like a strong, default choice.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest potential reward (+3 points), I'll take the calculated risk and play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice from my opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Another scissors tie - that's our second one. I'm still at -13 points and need to find a way to break this cycle.\n\nLooking at the pattern after scissors ties:\n- First scissors tie (round 19): they played scissors again in round 20\n- Second scissors tie (round 23): ?\n\nTheir recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors (tie)\n\nI'm noticing they have a very strong tendency to play scissors after ties, especially scissors ties. In round 20, right after our first scissors tie, they played scissors again.\n\nBut I also need to consider their broader strategy. They've been:\n1. Playing scissors heavily to bait me into rock\n2. Punishing my rock with paper for big losses\n3. Returning to scissors after paper\n\nIf they follow the pattern and play scissors again, rock would win (+1). But I've been burned three times now by playing rock after wins, only to get hit with paper immediately after.\n\nHowever, I'm at -13 points and rock vs scissors is still my only proven winning combination. The question is: will they stick with scissors (giving me a win) or switch to paper expecting me to play rock?\n\nGiven that we just tied with scissors and their previous behavior after scissors ties, I think there's a good chance they'll play scissors again. I need to take calculated risks at this point.\n\n[move] rock"
