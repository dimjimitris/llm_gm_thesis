My opponent played rock again, now for the third time. They seem to be incorporating rock more into their strategy, especially after losing rounds. This could indicate they're trying to diversify after I correctly predicted their scissors/paper pattern.\n\nAfter the tie, they might:\n1. Continue experimenting with rock\n2. Return to scissors (still their joint-most played move)\n3. Try paper to beat my potential rock repeat\n\nThe fact that they've played rock in rounds 12 and 15 (both ties) suggests they might be using it as a \"reset\" move when other strategies aren't working.\n\nIf they stick with rock, we tie again.\nIf they return to scissors, my rock wins (+1).\nIf they try paper, my scissors wins (+1).\n\nGiven that rock just tied twice and they might want to break that pattern, they'll likely return to either scissors or paper. Since they tend to alternate between these two, and their last non-rock move was paper (round 14), they might go back to scissors.\n\nI'll play rock to beat their likely scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

They're heavily favoring it, probably because of its high reward potential.\n\nLooking at their post-tie behavior with paper:\n- After paper tie (round 1): rock\n- After paper tie (round 4): scissors\n- After paper tie (round 17): rock\n- After paper tie (round 23): ?\n\nThe pattern after paper ties has been: rock, scissors, rock. Following this alternating pattern, they might play scissors next.\n\nAlso, they haven't played scissors in 4 rounds (since round 19), so they might be due to return to it.\n\nIf they play scissors, my rock wins (+1).\nIf they stick with paper, we tie again.\nIf they play rock, my paper wins (+3).\n\nGiven their post-paper-tie pattern suggests scissors, and they haven't used scissors recently, I think they'll play scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

We're back to the pattern where we're both being cautious and often matching each other's moves.\n\nLooking at their overall strategy, they seem to cycle through all three moves but with some clustering.

Switch to scissors (random variation)\n\nSince they've been somewhat unpredictable lately and we just tied on rock, I think paper is a good aggressive choice.

This shows they're still actively adapting and reading my strategy. Their recent moves: rock, rock, paper.\n\nNow they might expect me to continue with paper (since it's been working) and choose scissors to beat it. Or they might stick with paper to at least tie. Or they could go back to rock.\n\nGiven that they just made a strategic switch to paper to counter my paper strategy, they're likely thinking one level ahead. If they expect me to repeat paper, they'd choose scissors. To counter that, I should choose rock.\n\n[move] (They likely expect me to repeat paper and might choose scissors to beat it, so going with rock to counter scissors) rock",
