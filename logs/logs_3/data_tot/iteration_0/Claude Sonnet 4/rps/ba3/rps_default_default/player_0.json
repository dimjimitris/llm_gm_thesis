    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Their recent sequence: scissors, rock, rock. They seem to be falling back into a pattern of using rock as their safe choice, especially after losing rounds.\n\nThis is interesting - after all the pattern-breaking and adaptation earlier in the game, they appear to be settling into rock as their default when uncertain. This makes strategic sense since rock only has one bad matchup (paper at -3) versus scissors which loses to rock.\n\nIf they continue this defensive rock strategy, I should continue with paper to maximize my advantage. However, they might finally switch after losing another big -3 round. But given their recent tendency toward rock, I think paper is still the best choice.\n\n[move] (They seem to be defaulting to defensive rock again, continuing with paper for maximum points) paper"

Their recent moves: rock, rock, paper. This shows they're still actively adapting - when I found success with paper against their rock, they countered with paper to at least tie instead of lose.\n\nNow they might expect me to continue with paper and choose scissors to beat it. Or they might stick with paper since it just worked to stop my winning. Or they could go back to rock.\n\nGiven this counter-adaptation, I think scissors is a good choice here - it beats paper if they repeat it, and only loses 1 point to rock if they switch back to their defensive choice.\n\n[move] (They countered my paper strategy with their own paper, choosing scissors to beat their potential repeat paper) scissors"
