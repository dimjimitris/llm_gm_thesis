Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13 points)\n   - Rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper have lower stakes (\u00b11 point)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't know the payoff structure yet\n   - They might play randomly or use common tendencies\n   - Many people tend to start with rock in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who may default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players often choose.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider my options:\n   - Rock: If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play rock (rock ties)\n   - Paper: High reward (+3) if they play rock, but risky (-1) if they play scissors\n   - Scissors: They just played paper, might not expect scissors again\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since they broke their pattern by playing paper, they might be thinking more strategically now\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors or switch to rock\n   - Paper offers the highest reward and they just showed willingness to play paper\n   - If they're thinking counter-strategically, they might avoid rock (which would beat my expected scissors)\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze this major win:\n   - I played paper, they played rock\n   - I scored +3 points (the maximum possible)\n   - This confirms they've completely abandoned their mirroring strategy\n   - Total score update: I now have 7 points (3+1+1+1+1 from previous wins)\n\n2. Assess the new opponent behavior:\n   - Round 10: They played paper when I played scissors\n   - Round 11: They played rock when I played paper\n   - They seem to be playing more strategically/unpredictably now\n   - No clear pattern in these last two moves\n\n3. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They could be playing more randomly to avoid exploitation\n   - They might be using game theory mixed strategies\n   - Or they're trying common psychological patterns (like rock being a \"strong\" choice)\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - I'm significantly ahead in points (7 total)\n   - The predictable mirroring phase is over\n   - I need to adapt to more strategic play\n   - Each round now requires fresh analysis\n\n5. Think about their next move:\n   - They just lost badly (-3 points) with rock vs paper\n   - They might avoid rock next time\n   - They could try scissors to beat paper (if they expect me to repeat)\n   - Or they might try paper for the high-value matchup\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)  \n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n\n7. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - They just suffered a -3 penalty, so might avoid rock\n   - If they're thinking strategically, they might play scissors to counter expected paper\n   - Playing rock would beat scissors (+1) and has lower risk than paper\n   - The safe play with reasonable upside is rock\n\n[move] rock"

Review recent opponent behavior pattern:\n   - Round 10: Paper (when I played scissors)\n   - Round 11: Rock (when I played paper) \n   - Round 12: Scissors (when I played rock)\n   - They're playing different moves each round - no immediate repetition\n   - This suggests they're actively trying to be unpredictable\n\n3. Consider their psychology after losing:\n   - They just lost again (-1 point)\n   - They've now lost 3 rounds in a row since breaking the mirroring pattern\n   - They might be getting frustrated or second-guessing their new strategy\n   - They could revert to older patterns or try something different\n\n4.

Understand the opponent's strategy:\n   - Default behavior: Mirror my current move\n   - Exception rule: When I play rock, they play my previous move instead\n   - This is a highly predictable conditional strategy\n\n4. Test the rock exception again:\n   - My previous move was scissors\n   - If I play rock and the pattern holds, they should play scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors for +1 point\n   - This pattern has worked 2/2 times so far\n\n5. Consider if they might adapt:\n   - They've stuck to this pattern for 8 rounds\n   - Even though I've won both times I played rock, they haven't changed\n   - This suggests they're committed to this strategy or unaware of the exploit\n\n6. Risk assessment for playing rock:\n   - If pattern holds: They play scissors, I win +1\n   - If they adapt and mirror: They play rock, we tie (0)\n   - If they adapt differently: Worst case is -3 if they play paper\n   - The pattern has been 100% reliable for rock plays\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The rock exception has never failed\n   - Even if they adapt, the downside is manageable\n   - I need to score points, and this is my most reliable strategy\n\n[move] rock",

Confirm the pattern reliability:\n   - Rock plays: 3/3 times they played scissors (100% success rate)\n   - Non-rock plays: 6/6 times they mirrored my move (100% mirroring rate)\n   - This is an extremely consistent and exploitable pattern\n\n3. Understand their conditional strategy:\n   - When I play paper or scissors \u2192 they mirror immediately\n   - When I play rock \u2192 they play my previous move (delayed mirroring)\n   - They seem completely locked into this behavior\n\n4. Plan the next exploitation:\n   - My previous move was rock\n   - If I play rock again, they should play rock (my previous move)\n   - Rock vs rock = tie (0 points)\n   - This wouldn't be optimal\n\n5. Consider alternative strategies:\n   - If I play paper, they should mirror and play paper (tie)\n   - If I play scissors, they should mirror and play scissors (tie)\n   - To break ties, I need to predict when they might deviate\n\n6. Exploit the delayed mirroring:\n   - My previous move was rock\n   - If I play something other than rock, they'll mirror immediately\n   - But if I want to exploit their delayed mirroring when I play rock, I need to set up my \"previous move\" strategically\n\n7. Strategic setup:\n   - If I play paper now, they'll mirror (tie)\n   - But then if I play rock next round, they'll play paper (my upcoming move)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points) - that's bad\n   - If I play scissors now, they'll mirror (tie)\n   - But then if I play rock next round, they'll play scissors (my upcoming move)\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 point) - that's good\n\nI'll play scissors to set up another successful rock play in the following round.\n\n[move] scissors",

Decision reasoning:\n   - Since they broke their pattern by playing paper, they might be thinking more strategically now\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors or switch to rock\n   - Paper offers the highest reward and they just showed willingness to play paper\n   - If they're thinking counter-strategically, they might avoid rock (which would beat my expected scissors)\n\n[move] paper",

Confirm the unbreakable cycle:\n   - Their sequence: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper\n   - Perfect P-R-S cycle: 10/10 rounds following exact pattern\n   - Even under extreme pressure (-16 points), no deviation\n   - Next in cycle: Rock\n\n5. Analyze the psychological phenomenon:\n   - 10 consecutive losses should trigger adaptation in any rational player\n   - Instead, they're more rigidly locked into the pattern\n   - This suggests complete unconscious behavioral automation\n   - They appear unable to recognize their own predictability\n\n6. Predict with maximum confidence:\n   - Cycle position: Paper just played, Rock comes next\n   - Pattern has been 100% reliable for 10 rounds under maximum stress\n   - No indication of pattern-breaking capability\n   - Rock is essentially certain\n\n7.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the asymmetric payoffs yet.

Develop strategy: If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n5. Risk assessment: Even if wrong, the worst case scenarios are:\n   - If they play scissors: I lose 1 point (not catastrophic)\n   - If they play paper: It's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe high reward potential of paper beating rock (+3) outweighs the modest risk, especially against a fresh player likely to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Consider risk factors:\n   - If they've realized I caught onto their pattern, they might change strategy\n   - If they play scissors instead, I lose -1 point (manageable loss)\n   - If they play paper, we tie for 0 points\n   - The potential reward (+3) significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1)\n\n5. Evaluate the pattern break possibility:\n   - Even if they break the mirroring pattern, paper vs rock is the highest value matchup\n   - Many players gravitate toward rock when changing strategies\n   - The risk/reward ratio strongly favors playing paper\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The mirroring pattern is well-established over 3 rounds\n   - Paper offers maximum reward against the predicted rock\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is relatively small compared to the potential gain\n\n[move] paper",

Test the rock hypothesis:\n   - Playing rock has been my only successful strategy (2/2 wins)\n   - If they continue this pattern, playing rock should beat their scissors again\n   - My previous move was scissors, so if they use delayed mirroring, they'll play scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock vs scissors = +1 point (guaranteed win if pattern holds)\n   - The pattern has been consistent: rock beats their response\n   - Even if they adapt, rock vs paper = -3, rock vs rock = 0\n   - Given the strong historical success, this is worth the risk\n\n6. Meta-game consideration:\n   - They might be expecting me to play rock again\n   - But their behavior suggests they have a programmed response to rock\n   - The consistency of their mirroring suggests they may not be adapting as much as I thought\n\n[move] rock",

Consider what this pattern break means:\n   - They may have adapted their strategy\n   - They might be trying to counter-exploit my behavior\n   - Or they could be switching to a different conditional rule\n   - The timing is suspicious - right after I won 3 times with rock\n\n4. Evaluate possible new strategies they might be using:\n   - They played paper (which beats rock) - maybe anticipating I'd play rock again\n   - They might be trying to counter my rock-exploitation strategy\n   - Or they're shifting to a more random/unpredictable approach\n\n5. Consider my options now:\n   - The old pattern may be broken, so rock might not guarantee scissors anymore\n   - If they're adapting, they might expect me to play rock and counter with paper\n   - But they also might revert to old patterns\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - If I play rock and they've adapted to play paper: -3 points (very bad)\n   - If I play rock and old pattern holds: +1 points (good)\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: +3 points (excellent)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper again: +1 points (good)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - The pattern break suggests they're adapting\n   - Playing paper could capitalize if they're switching to rock-heavy play\n   - This also avoids the -3 risk if they're now countering rock with paper\n   - Given they just played paper, they might not expect me to play paper\n\n[move] paper",

Evaluate the new uncertainty:\n   - I can no longer rely on the mirroring pattern\n   - They might be becoming more unpredictable\n   - The rock exception might still hold, or it might not\n   - I need to adapt to this new dynamic\n\n5. Consider my options:\n   - Rock: Previously reliable (+1 vs scissors), but pattern may be broken\n   - Paper: High reward potential (+3 vs rock), moderate risk\n   - Scissors: Just worked (+1 vs paper), but they might counter-adapt\n\n6.

Strategic decision analysis:\n   - If they play paper (most likely): Scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors: Good against paper (+1), bad against rock (-1)\n   - Paper: Excellent against rock (+3), bad against scissors (-1)\n   - Rock: Good against scissors (+1), terrible against paper (-3)\n\nGiven they're likely seeking a comeback and paper offers the highest reward potential, I think they'll try paper. Scissors is the safe counter with decent reward.\n\n[move] scissors",
