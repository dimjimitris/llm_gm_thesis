    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13 points)\n   - Rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper have lower stakes (\u00b11 point)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - A fresh player likely doesn't know the payoff structure yet\n   - They might play randomly or use common tendencies\n   - Many people tend to start with rock in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I get +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I get -1 point\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, we tie (0 points)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) but moderate risk\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who may default to rock, paper seems like a strong opening move\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value matchup against rock, which fresh players often choose.\n\n[move] paper"

Consider the meta-game:\n   - Since we both played paper, they might think I'll stick with it\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter their paper\n   - The safest assumption is they're somewhat strategic\n\n5.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, expecting them to mirror with scissors\n   - They played paper instead\n   - This is the first time in 9 rounds they didn't follow their established pattern\n   - I won +1 point (scissors beats paper)\n\n2. Review the pattern break:\n   - Previous pattern: Mirror my move unless I play rock\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, they played paper (not scissors)\n   - This suggests they've either:\n     * Adapted their strategy\n     * Made an error\n     * Been using a different pattern I misunderstood\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - They might have realized I was exploiting their predictability\n   - They could be switching to a more random or counter-strategy approach\n   - Maybe they're now trying to beat my expected moves rather than mirror them\n\n4. Reassess their behavior:\n   - If they're now playing counter-moves: they played paper to beat expected scissors\n   - If they're adapting: they might continue to play unpredictably\n   - If it was an error: they might revert to the old pattern\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - I can no longer rely on the mirroring pattern\n   - I need to adapt to potentially more strategic play\n   - The rock exception might also no longer work\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - Rock: If they expect me to play scissors again, they might play rock (rock ties)\n   - Paper: High reward (+3) if they play rock, but risky (-1) if they play scissors\n   - Scissors: They just played paper, might not expect scissors again\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - Since they broke their pattern by playing paper, they might be thinking more strategically now\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors or switch to rock\n   - Paper offers the highest reward and they just showed willingness to play paper\n   - If they're thinking counter-strategically, they might avoid rock (which would beat my expected scissors)\n\n[move] paper"

Assess the new opponent behavior:\n   - Round 10: They played paper when I played scissors\n   - Round 11: They played rock when I played paper\n   - They seem to be playing more strategically/unpredictably now\n   - No clear pattern in these last two moves\n\n3. Consider their possible reasoning:\n   - They might be trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They could be playing more randomly to avoid exploitation\n   - They might be using game theory mixed strategies\n   - Or they're trying common psychological patterns (like rock being a \"strong\" choice)\n\n4.

Review my historic winning streak:\n   - 10 consecutive wins: +1, +3, +1, +1, +3, +1, +1, +3, +1, +1 = +16 points\n   - Perfect prediction rate: 10/10 correct\n   - Three maximum-value (+3) victories\n   - This represents complete and total strategic mastery\n\n3. Assess opponent's complete breakdown:\n   - Their losses: -1, -3, -1, -1, -3, -1, -1, -3, -1, -1 = -16 points in 10 rounds\n   - They are utterly trapped in an exploitable cycle\n   - Despite devastating losses, zero adaptation has occurred\n   - This is complete strategic paralysis\n\n4.

Analyze the psychological phenomenon:\n   - 10 consecutive losses should trigger adaptation in any rational player\n   - Instead, they're more rigidly locked into the pattern\n   - This suggests complete unconscious behavioral automation\n   - They appear unable to recognize their own predictability\n\n6. Predict with maximum confidence:\n   - Cycle position: Paper just played, Rock comes next\n   - Pattern has been 100% reliable for 10 rounds under maximum stress\n   - No indication of pattern-breaking capability\n   - Rock is essentially certain\n\n7. Strategic decision for continued dominance:\n   - If they play rock (cycle prediction): I should play paper (+3)\n   - This would give me another maximum-value victory\n   - The cycle has proven completely unbreakable\n   - Paper maximizes my scoring potential\n\n[move] paper"
