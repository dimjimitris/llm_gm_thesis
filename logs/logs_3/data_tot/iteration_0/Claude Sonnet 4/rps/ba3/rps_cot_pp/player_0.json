    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Key observation: Paper vs Rock has the highest payoff differential (6 points total swing), while the other matchups only have 2 points total swing.\n\n3. Strategy considerations for playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n   - If they choose rock, I want to choose paper to get the maximum +3 points\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenarios are:\n     - If they choose paper (tie): 0 points\n     - If they choose scissors: -1 point\n   \n4. Risk-reward analysis for paper:\n   - Best case: +3 points (if opponent plays rock)\n   - Neutral case: 0 points (if opponent plays paper)\n   - Worst case: -1 point (if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Expected value is positive if there's any reasonable chance they play rock\n\n5. Since this is against a fresh player who might gravitate toward rock, and paper offers the highest potential reward, I should choose paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Review of last round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - I lost 1 point\n   - This shows the opponent didn't go with the \"typical beginner rock\" choice\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They either got lucky with scissors, or they're thinking strategically\n   - They might have anticipated that I'd expect them to play rock and chose paper\n   - Or they might have a preference for scissors\n\n3. Strategy considerations for round 2:\n   - If they're thinking one level ahead, they might expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk analysis for each move:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Since I don't have enough data to predict their pattern yet, and the opponent just played scissors, I should consider that they might:\n   - Repeat scissors (rock would win)\n   - Switch to counter my expected counter-move\n\n6. Given the high reward for paper beating rock (+3), and that many players alternate or switch to rock after playing scissors, I'll stick with paper but for different reasoning this time.\n\n[move] paper"

What this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They're not sticking to one move\n   - They switched from scissors to rock\n   - This could indicate they're trying to counter what they think I'll do\n   - Or they might be following some pattern or randomizing\n\n3.
