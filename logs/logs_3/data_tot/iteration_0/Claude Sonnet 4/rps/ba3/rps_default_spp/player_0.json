You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know about this asymmetric payoff, they might play randomly or use standard rock-paper-scissors intuition. Many players in regular rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock.\n\nGiven the high reward for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the fact that rock is a common opening move, I should play paper to potentially capitalize on this high-value matchup.\n\n[move] paper"

My total is now -3 points.\n\nTheir recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nAfter the paper tie, they went to scissors as I predicted. Their current distribution:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Scissors: 9 times (now their most frequent)\n- Rock: 7 times\n\nI've now won 2 out of the last 24 rounds (rounds 17 and 23), which shows how dominated I was during that 5-game losing streak. But I'm starting to read them better again.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that after ties, they often switch to a different move. After we tied with paper, they played scissors, and I correctly anticipated this with rock.\n\nLooking at their recent behavior:\n- They've moved away from the early game pattern of mostly paper/scissors\n- Rock is now much more prominent in their strategy  \n- They seem to avoid repeating the same move after ties\n- Scissors remains their most-used move overall\n\nAfter losing with scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (their second-most frequent move, and offers +3 vs rock)\n2. Try rock (which has been working well for them recently)\n3. Avoid scissors temporarily (since it just lost)\n\nGiven that I just won with rock, they might expect me to either stick with rock (since it worked) or switch to paper (going for the high-value play). If they think I'll play rock again, they'd want to play paper for the +3.\n\nBut they might also think I'll switch to paper and counter with scissors.\n\nI think there's a good chance they'll play paper, expecting me to stick with rock. I'll play scissors to beat their likely paper.\n\n[move] scissors"
