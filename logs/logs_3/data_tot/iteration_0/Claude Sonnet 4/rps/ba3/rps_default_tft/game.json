Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games. If my opponent chooses rock, paper would give me the maximum 3 points. Even if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is better than the potential 3-point loss if I chose rock and they chose paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

My analysis was correct - the opponent chose rock and I gained 3 points with paper.\n\nNow for the second round, I need to think about what a fresh player might do after losing with rock. Common psychological patterns include:\n\n1. Sticking with rock (stubborn/consistent approach)\n2. Switching to what beat them (paper) \n3. Switching to what would have beaten my paper (scissors)\n4. Random choice\n\nGiven that paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but I need to be careful about the high penalty (-3) if they choose scissors. However, if they choose scissors (thinking to counter my previous paper), and I choose rock, I'd only get +1 point. If they choose paper (copying what beat them or what I played), and I choose scissors, I get +1 point.\n\nBut if they stick with rock again or choose randomly, paper still gives me the best expected value.

Go back to rock\u2192paper (which worked well for them before)\n2. Continue being unpredictable\n3. Try scissors again (like round 16\u219217)\n\nGiven their increasing sophistication and the fact that rock\u2192paper gave them big wins before (+3 points when I played scissors), they might try paper again.\n\nI'll play scissors to counter the potential paper play.\n\n[move] Scissors",

This is completely new behavior - they've never repeated the same move after rock before. They're evolving their strategy and becoming much harder to predict.\n\nNow for what comes after rock in round 19. Since they just did something completely new (rock\u2192rock), I have very little data to predict their next move. They could:\n1. Continue with rock (establishing a new rock\u2192rock pattern)\n2. Go to paper (their historically successful rock\u2192paper)\n3. Try scissors\n4. Continue being completely unpredictable\n\nGiven that they just surprised me twice in a row with rock, and rock has been working well for them (winning the last two rounds), they might stick with what's working and play rock again.\n\nIf they play rock again, I should play paper (+3).\nIf they switch to paper, I should play scissors (+1).\nIf they play scissors, I should play rock (+1).\n\nSince rock has been their successful move lately and they might stick with it, I'll go with paper for the potential +3 reward.\n\n[move] Paper",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

But they could also:\n1. Try paper (for the high reward, especially after several low-reward moves)\n2. Stick with rock if they think it might work again\n3. Continue being unpredictable\n\nGiven that they haven't used paper in a while and might want that +3 reward, and considering that rock\u2192paper has been successful for them historically, I think paper is a strong possibility.\n\nI'll play scissors to counter the potential paper.\n\n[move] Scissors",
