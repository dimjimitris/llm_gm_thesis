    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games. If my opponent chooses rock, paper would give me the maximum 3 points. Even if they choose scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is better than the potential 3-point loss if I chose rock and they chose paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

My analysis was correct - the opponent chose rock and I gained 3 points with paper.\n\nNow for the second round, I need to think about what a fresh player might do after losing with rock. Common psychological patterns include:\n\n1. Sticking with rock (stubborn/consistent approach)\n2. Switching to what beat them (paper) \n3. Switching to what would have beaten my paper (scissors)\n4. Random choice\n\nGiven that paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but I need to be careful about the high penalty (-3) if they choose scissors. However, if they choose scissors (thinking to counter my previous paper), and I choose rock, I'd only get +1 point. If they choose paper (copying what beat them or what I played), and I choose scissors, I get +1 point.\n\nBut if they stick with rock again or choose randomly, paper still gives me the best expected value. The fresh player might not have learned the lesson about paper's high value yet.\n\n[move] Paper"
