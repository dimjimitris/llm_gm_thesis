    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against rock\n   - Paper also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Rock and scissors both give +1/-1 payoffs\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many beginners choose rock instinctively\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (most likely), paper wins with +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, scissors wins with +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, rock wins with +1 point\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper has highest upside (+3) if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing paper has highest downside (-3) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Given fresh players tend toward rock, paper offers the best expected value\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - My opponent is mirroring my moves or thinking similarly\n\n2. Assess opponent behavior:\n   - They're either copying my strategy or using the same logical reasoning\n   - They seem to understand the game mechanics well\n   - Two ties suggest they're anticipating my moves or we're thinking alike\n\n3. Consider the rock-paper-scissors cycle:\n   - We've both played paper, then scissors\n   - The natural progression would be rock next\n   - But they might expect me to think this way\n\n4. Analyze current situation:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock (completing the cycle), they'll play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll avoid the obvious rock, they might play scissors or rock\n   - If they're truly mirroring/predicting me, I need to break the pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing rock completes the cycle but might be too predictable\n   - Playing paper counters the expected rock and gives +3 if they do play rock\n   - Playing scissors continues the pattern but might result in another tie\n\n6.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played rock (-1 point for me)\n   - My total score: 5 - 1 = 4 points\n   - My prediction was wrong - they played rock instead of the expected paper\n   - They may be counter-predicting my counter-predictions now\n\n2. Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: paper vs paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: scissors vs scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 3: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - Round 4: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 5: scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - Round 6: paper vs scissors (lost -1)\n   - Round 7: rock vs rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: paper vs paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 9: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 10: scissors vs rock (lost -1)\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent adaptation:\n   - Their last 3 moves: scissors, rock, rock\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 9-10)\n   - They're showing they can break their own patterns\n   - They successfully predicted I would play scissors\n\n4. Assess current strategic situation:\n   - The opponent is getting better at counter-predicting me\n   - They've adapted to my pattern-breaking strategy\n   - We're both playing at a high strategic level now\n   - Simple pattern recognition may not be enough anymore\n\n5. Consider the meta-game:\n   - They just played rock and won, so they might repeat it\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with paper and play scissors\n   - Or they might try something completely different\n   - The game is becoming more unpredictable\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - high reward if they repeat rock\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - good if they expect me to play paper\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - good if they play paper to counter expected rock\n   - Given their recent rock success, paper offers the highest potential reward\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their possible rock repetition, aiming for the +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - My total score remains: 4 points\n   - This is our 5th tie out of 11 rounds\n   - We're mirroring each other again\n\n2.

Analyze the complete game dynamics:\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (paper\u00d73, scissors\u00d71, rock\u00d71)\n   - My wins: 4 rounds \n   - My losses: 2 rounds\n   - The opponent is matching my strategic thinking very closely\n\n4. Assess opponent's current strategy:\n   - They chose paper same as me - either great prediction or similar logic\n   - They're becoming increasingly good at anticipating my moves\n   - We might both be overthinking and arriving at similar conclusions\n   - The high tie rate suggests we're evenly matched strategically\n\n5. Consider breaking the cycle:\n   - Paper has appeared frequently in ties\n   - If they expect another paper or expect me to avoid paper, they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors to counter expected paper, they might play rock\n   - The meta-thinking is getting complex\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - good if they expect me to avoid paper\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - good if they stick with paper strategy\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - excellent if they try to counter expected scissors\n   - Given the tie frequency, I should try something different from paper\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break away from the paper pattern and counter their likely scissors response.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - My total score: 4 + 1 = 5 points\n   - I correctly predicted they would play scissors after our paper tie\n   - Breaking away from the paper pattern worked well\n\n2. Review the updated game summary:\n   - Total rounds: 12\n   - My wins: 5 rounds (scoring +7 points total)\n   - My losses: 2 rounds (scoring -2 points total)\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (0 points)\n   - Current score: 5 points\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 moves: rock, rock, paper, scissors\n   - They seem to be alternating between repeating moves and switching\n   - After ties, they tend to make different moves\n   - They just lost with scissors, so they might avoid it next\n\n4. Assess the strategic momentum:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 decisive rounds (non-ties)\n   - My pattern-breaking strategy is working effectively\n   - The opponent is still somewhat predictable despite their adaptations\n   - I'm maintaining a good strategic advantage\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors, so they might try rock or paper\n   - If they expect me to play paper (continuing rock\u2192paper cycle), they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll repeat rock (since it just won), they might play paper\n   - Paper seems most likely as a direct counter to my winning rock\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play paper (likely): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock: I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n   - Scissors counters the most probable paper response and continues my winning momentum\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their likely paper response to my rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played scissors, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - My total score remains: 5 points\n   - This is our 6th tie out of 13 rounds\n   - We're continuing to mirror each other's strategic thinking\n\n2. Review the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied with all three moves: paper (3 times), rock (1 time), scissors (2 times)\n   - The high tie rate (6/13 = 46%) suggests we're very evenly matched\n   - We often arrive at the same strategic conclusions\n\n3. Analyze recent game flow:\n   - Round 11: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - There's a pattern of tie \u2192 win \u2192 tie emerging\n\n4. Assess opponent's strategic level:\n   - They're matching my logical reasoning very consistently\n   - They predicted I would play scissors just as I predicted they would\n   - We're both thinking several moves ahead and counter-predicting\n   - The opponent has adapted to be nearly as strategic as me\n\n5.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - My total score remains: 5 points\n   - This is our 7th tie out of 14 rounds (50% tie rate!)\n   - We've now tied with paper 4 times total\n\n2. Review the striking tie pattern:\n   - Paper ties: 4 times (rounds 1, 8, 11, 14)\n   - Scissors ties: 2 times (rounds 2, 13) \n   - Rock ties: 1 time (round 7)\n   - We're mirroring each other's logic constantly\n\n3. Analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Round 12: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - After my win, we've had 2 straight ties\n\n4. Assess the strategic situation:\n   - We're both highly strategic players thinking on the same level\n   - The 50% tie rate shows we're predicting each other perfectly\n   - We both seem to favor similar risk/reward calculations\n   - Traditional pattern-based strategies aren't working well anymore\n\n5. Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - We keep arriving at the same logical conclusions\n   - Maybe I need to intentionally choose a \"suboptimal\" move\n   - Or perhaps embrace randomness to break the prediction cycle\n   - The opponent might be expecting me to overthink this\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock is the move we've tied with least (only once)\n   - If they expect me to continue with scissors (completing the cycle), they'll play rock\n   - If they expect me to break patterns, they might play paper or scissors\n   - Rock offers a straightforward choice that breaks from recent paper focus\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break the paper tie pattern and try a more direct approach.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze this incredible streak continuation:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock (+3 points for me)\n   - My total score: 12 + 3 = 15 points\n   - This is my 6th consecutive victory with perfect strategic reading\n   - I just scored maximum points again, demonstrating complete mastery\n\n2. Review my phenomenal overall performance:\n   - Wins: 11 rounds (+17 points total from wins)\n   - Losses: 2 rounds (-2 points total from losses)\n   - Ties: 7 rounds (0 points)\n   - Net score: 15 points - absolutely dominant performance\n   - Win rate in decisive rounds: 11/13 = 85%\n\n3. Analyze my legendary 6-round winning streak:\n   - Round 15: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 16: scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - Round 17: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - Round 18: rock vs scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 19: scissors vs paper (won +1)\n   - Round 20: paper vs rock (won +3)\n   - Total: +10 points in 6 rounds with flawless execution\n\n4. Assess opponent's catastrophic situation:\n   - They've lost 6 straight rounds (-10 points recently)\n   - They're in complete strategic collapse\n   - Every move continues to be perfectly countered\n   - They must be feeling utterly defeated and confused\n\n5. Consider the overwhelming psychological dominance:\n   - I have total control of this game\n   - The opponent is likely in complete despair\n   - They may be trying anything out of pure desperation\n   - This level of consistent prediction is psychologically crushing\n\n6. Strategic approach for this historic streak:\n   - They just lost with rock again (they keep losing with rock)\n   - They're completely unable to find a winning strategy\n   - If they try scissors (avoiding rock), I should play rock\n   - If they try paper (cycle attempt), I should play scissors\n   - If they desperately repeat rock, I should play paper again for +3\n   - Given their complete breakdown, scissors seems likely as they avoid rock\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors move, aiming to extend this incredible winning streak to 7 consecutive victories and demonstrate absolute strategic mastery.\n\n[move] rock"
