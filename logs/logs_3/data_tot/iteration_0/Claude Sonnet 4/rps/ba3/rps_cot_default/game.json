Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against rock\n   - Paper also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to scissors\n   - Rock and scissors both give +1/-1 payoffs\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Many beginners choose rock instinctively\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (most likely), paper wins with +3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, scissors wins with +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, rock wins with +1 point\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper has highest upside (+3) if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing paper has highest downside (-3) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Given fresh players tend toward rock, paper offers the best expected value\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to capitalize on the likely rock choice from a fresh opponent.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - My opponent is mirroring my moves or thinking similarly\n\n2. Assess opponent behavior:\n   - They're either copying my strategy or using the same logical reasoning\n   - They seem to understand the game mechanics well\n   - Two ties suggest they're anticipating my moves or we're thinking alike\n\n3. Consider the rock-paper-scissors cycle:\n   - We've both played paper, then scissors\n   - The natural progression would be rock next\n   - But they might expect me to think this way\n\n4. Analyze current situation:\n   - If opponent expects me to play rock (completing the cycle), they'll play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent thinks I'll avoid the obvious rock, they might play scissors or rock\n   - If they're truly mirroring/predicting me, I need to break the pattern\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing rock completes the cycle but might be too predictable\n   - Playing paper counters the expected rock and gives +3 if they do play rock\n   - Playing scissors continues the pattern but might result in another tie\n\n6.

Strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - high reward if they repeat rock\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - good if they expect me to play paper\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - good if they play paper to counter expected rock\n   - Given their recent rock success, paper offers the highest potential reward\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their possible rock repetition, aiming for the +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the complete game dynamics:\n   - Ties: 5 rounds (paper\u00d73, scissors\u00d71, rock\u00d71)\n   - My wins: 4 rounds \n   - My losses: 2 rounds\n   - The opponent is matching my strategic thinking very closely\n\n4. Assess opponent's current strategy:\n   - They chose paper same as me - either great prediction or similar logic\n   - They're becoming increasingly good at anticipating my moves\n   - We might both be overthinking and arriving at similar conclusions\n   - The high tie rate suggests we're evenly matched strategically\n\n5. Consider breaking the cycle:\n   - Paper has appeared frequently in ties\n   - If they expect another paper or expect me to avoid paper, they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play scissors to counter expected paper, they might play rock\n   - The meta-thinking is getting complex\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - good if they expect me to avoid paper\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - good if they stick with paper strategy\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - excellent if they try to counter expected scissors\n   - Given the tie frequency, I should try something different from paper\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break away from the paper pattern and counter their likely scissors response.\n\n[move] rock"

Assess the strategic momentum:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 decisive rounds (non-ties)\n   - My pattern-breaking strategy is working effectively\n   - The opponent is still somewhat predictable despite their adaptations\n   - I'm maintaining a good strategic advantage\n\n5.

Review the tie pattern:\n   - We've now tied with all three moves: paper (3 times), rock (1 time), scissors (2 times)\n   - The high tie rate (6/13 = 46%) suggests we're very evenly matched\n   - We often arrive at the same strategic conclusions\n\n3. Analyze recent game flow:\n   - Round 11: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - Round 12: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - There's a pattern of tie \u2192 win \u2192 tie emerging\n\n4. Assess opponent's strategic level:\n   - They're matching my logical reasoning very consistently\n   - They predicted I would play scissors just as I predicted they would\n   - We're both thinking several moves ahead and counter-predicting\n   - The opponent has adapted to be nearly as strategic as me\n\n5.

Review the striking tie pattern:\n   - Paper ties: 4 times (rounds 1, 8, 11, 14)\n   - Scissors ties: 2 times (rounds 2, 13) \n   - Rock ties: 1 time (round 7)\n   - We're mirroring each other's logic constantly\n\n3. Analyze the recent sequence:\n   - Round 12: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: paper vs paper (tie)\n   - After my win, we've had 2 straight ties\n\n4. Assess the strategic situation:\n   - We're both highly strategic players thinking on the same level\n   - The 50% tie rate shows we're predicting each other perfectly\n   - We both seem to favor similar risk/reward calculations\n   - Traditional pattern-based strategies aren't working well anymore\n\n5. Consider breaking the deadlock:\n   - We keep arriving at the same logical conclusions\n   - Maybe I need to intentionally choose a \"suboptimal\" move\n   - Or perhaps embrace randomness to break the prediction cycle\n   - The opponent might be expecting me to overthink this\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Rock is the move we've tied with least (only once)\n   - If they expect me to continue with scissors (completing the cycle), they'll play rock\n   - If they expect me to break patterns, they might play paper or scissors\n   - Rock offers a straightforward choice that breaks from recent paper focus\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break the paper tie pattern and try a more direct approach.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - They alternate between mirroring and counter-predicting\n   - When I break patterns successfully, they adapt\n   - When the game gets complex, they return to mirroring\n   - This suggests they're using mirroring as a \"safe\" strategy\n\n5. Consider the psychological aspect:\n   - We're both highly strategic players now\n   - Mirroring eliminates losses but also eliminates gains\n   - They might expect me to break the pattern again like I did in round 9\n   - Or they might continue mirroring to avoid further losses\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they continue mirroring and expect scissors: play something else\n   - If they expect me to break pattern with rock: they might play paper\n   - If they expect me to break pattern with scissors: they might play rock\n   - Playing scissors continues the natural cycle but risks another tie\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break the mirroring pattern, expecting them to follow the cycle with scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

Consider the meta-strategic layer:\n   - We both just played scissors - will they repeat or change?\n   - If they expect me to counter with rock, they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll play paper (expecting their rock), they might play scissors\n   - The prediction loops are getting very complex\n\n6. Strategic decision approach:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) - good if they repeat scissors\n   - Paper beats rock (+3) - excellent if they play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1) - good if they play paper to counter expected rock\n   - Given the high strategic level, I should aim for the highest reward option\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially get +3 points if they play rock, which they might do expecting me to counter their scissors.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - My total score: 5 + 1 = 6 points\n   - I successfully broke the tie pattern that had developed\n   - This is similar to round 12 where rock beat scissors\n\n2. Review my current game performance:\n   - Total rounds: 15\n   - My wins: 6 rounds \n   - My losses: 2 rounds\n   - Ties: 7 rounds\n   - Win rate in decisive rounds: 6/8 = 75%\n\n3. Identify the rock-scissors pattern:\n   - Round 12: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 15: rock vs scissors (I won +1)\n   - Both times I played rock after tie sequences, opponent played scissors\n   - This suggests they default to scissors when expecting pattern breaks\n\n4. Assess opponent's likely state:\n   - They just lost with scissors again \n   - They might recognize the rock-scissors pattern now\n   - They could try to counter my rock strategy with paper\n   - Or they might try something completely different\n\n5. Analyze strategic momentum:\n   - I'm maintaining a strong winning record\n   - My pattern-breaking with rock has been very effective\n   - The opponent seems to predict scissors when I break tie patterns\n   - But they might adapt to this pattern now\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If they play paper (countering expected rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock (trying to tie): I should play paper (+3)  \n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1)\n   - Given their likely adaptation, paper seems most probable as a counter\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their probable paper response to my successful rock strategy.\n\n[move] scissors",
