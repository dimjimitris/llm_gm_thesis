    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move might be most strategic. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the reasonable assumption that a fresh player might choose rock, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Started trying to predict my moves rather than just counter my previous winning move\n\nSince they just played paper, for round 12 they might:\n- Stick with paper (since it tied, which is better than losing)\n- Switch to scissors if they expect me to play paper again\n- Go back to their old reactive pattern and play rock to counter my paper\n\nThe fact that they deviated from their established pattern suggests they're evolving their strategy. They might be trying to think ahead now rather than just reacting.\n\nGiven that paper has the highest reward (+3) and they just experienced a tie with it, they might stick with paper hoping I'll switch to rock. However, if they think I'll repeat paper, they might try scissors.\n\nI think I'll play scissors - it beats paper (+1) if they stick with it, ties with scissors if they switch to that, but loses to rock (-1) if they go back to their old pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Getting more comfortable with different moves\n\nFor round 14, I need to consider that they're less predictable now.

This suggests they might be reverting to their comfort zone with scissors, despite the recent success with paper.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Round 1: Paper vs Rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 2: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point  \n- Round 3: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 4: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 5: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 6: Rock vs Rock \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 7: Paper vs Rock \u2192 I won +3 points\n- Round 8: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 9: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 10: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 11: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 12: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Round 13: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 14: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 15: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 16: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 17: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 18: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 19: Rock vs Paper \u2192 I lost -3 points\n- Round 20: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Total: +11 points\n\nThe opponent's pattern: they played scissors in rounds 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, then paper in round 19, and back to scissors in round 20. That's eight scissors out of the last eleven rounds!\n\nThis suggests that despite their brief paper success, scissors remains their deeply ingrained preference. They might have:\n1. Defaulted back to their comfort zone\n2. Been experimenting with paper but returned to scissors\n3. Expected me to continue with rock and wanted to tie rather than lose\n\nFor round 21, given their strong historical preference for scissors (8 out of 11 recent rounds), I should play rock to beat scissors and get +1 point. The single paper play seems to have been an anomaly rather than a new pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

That's nine scissors out of the last twelve rounds, with only one paper and two ties disrupting the pattern.\n\nThe opponent's scissors preference is absolutely dominant. Even after successfully using paper to beat my rock in round 19, they immediately reverted to scissors in the next two rounds. This shows scissors is their deeply ingrained default choice.\n\nFor round 22, given this overwhelming evidence of their scissors preference (9 out of 12 recent rounds), I should continue with rock. The probability of scissors is extremely high, making rock almost a guaranteed +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent's behavior suggests they're either:\n1. Completely committed to scissors as their strategy\n2. Unable to break their scissors habit\n3. Hoping I'll eventually change strategies\n\nThe probability strongly favors scissors, making rock the optimal choice for another +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"
