Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move might be most strategic. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points), and the reasonable assumption that a fresh player might choose rock, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

They're starting to break away from the purely reactive strategy. In the last few rounds:\n- Round 11: Played paper instead of expected rock (broke pattern)\n- Round 12: Went back to rock (reactive pattern)  \n- Round 13: Played scissors instead of expected paper (broke pattern again)\n\nThis suggests they're evolving their strategy and becoming harder to predict. They might be:\n1. Mixing reactive moves with random/strategic moves\n2. Starting to think about what I might expect\n3. Getting more comfortable with different moves\n\nFor round 14, I need to consider that they're less predictable now. However, they just played scissors twice recently (rounds 10 and 13), so they might:\n- Stick with scissors (they seem comfortable with it)\n- Try rock to beat scissors if they expect me to repeat\n- Try paper for the high payoff\n\nGiven the increased unpredictability, I'll go with rock. It beats scissors (+1) if they stick with it, loses to paper (-3) but ties with rock (0). Since they've used scissors frequently, rock seems like a reasonable choice.\n\n[move] Rock"

This shows scissors is their deeply ingrained default choice.\n\nFor round 22, given this overwhelming evidence of their scissors preference (9 out of 12 recent rounds), I should continue with rock. The probability of scissors is extremely high, making rock almost a guaranteed +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"

That's nine scissors out of the last twelve rounds, with only one paper and two ties disrupting the pattern.\n\nThe opponent's scissors preference is absolutely dominant. Even after successfully using paper to beat my rock in round 19, they immediately reverted to scissors in the next two rounds. This shows scissors is their deeply ingrained default choice.\n\nFor round 22, given this overwhelming evidence of their scissors preference (9 out of 12 recent rounds), I should continue with rock. The probability of scissors is extremely high, making rock almost a guaranteed +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock",

The opponent has shown an overwhelming preference for scissors, with only one brief paper experiment (round 19) breaking the pattern. They consistently return to scissors despite it repeatedly losing to my rock.\n\nFor round 23, given this massive evidence (10 out of 13 recent rounds), I should absolutely continue with rock. The opponent's behavior suggests they're either:\n1. Completely committed to scissors as their strategy\n2. Unable to break their scissors habit\n3. Hoping I'll eventually change strategies\n\nThe probability strongly favors scissors, making rock the optimal choice for another +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock",

          "output_text": "Perfect! The opponent played scissors for the eleventh time in fourteen rounds, and my rock beat it for another +1 point. This pattern is now absolutely dominant.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Rounds 1-9: Various moves, +6 points\n- Round 10: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 11: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 12: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I lost -1 point\n- Round 13: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 14: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 15: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 16: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 17: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 18: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 19: Rock vs Paper \u2192 I lost -3 points\n- Round 20: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie, 0 points\n- Round 21: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 22: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Round 23: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n- Total: +14 points\n\nThe opponent's scissors pattern is now overwhelming: rounds 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23. That's eleven scissors out of the last fourteen rounds!\n\nThis is one of the most predictable patterns I've ever seen in a game. The opponent has shown an almost compulsive preference for scissors, with only one paper attempt (round 19) and a few ties disrupting an otherwise complete scissors strategy.\n\nFor round 24, the evidence is absolutely overwhelming that they will play scissors again. Their behavior suggests they're either:\n1. Stuck in a psychological pattern with scissors\n2. Committed to a scissors-only strategy\n3. Unable to adapt despite consistent losses\n\nI should continue with rock for what is essentially a guaranteed +1 point.\n\n[move] Rock",
