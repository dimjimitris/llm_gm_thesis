    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Key observation: Paper beating rock gives 3 points (highest reward), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point.\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - If I play paper and win against rock, I get +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If I play rock and win against scissors, I get +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and win against paper, I get +1 point\n   - The penalty for losing with paper is -3 (highest risk)\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - This makes paper a strong opening move to capitalize on this tendency\n   - The high reward (+3) for paper beating rock makes it worth the risk\n\n5. Decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum points if the opponent chooses rock, which is statistically likely for a new player.\n\n[move] paper"

Analysis of previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the other player might also be thinking strategically about the high payoff for paper beating rock\n\n2. Strategic implications:\n   - The other player chose paper, which indicates they understand the scoring system\n   - They might continue with paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n   - Or they might anticipate that I'll stick with paper and switch to scissors to counter me\n\n3. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stay with paper): I should stay with paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to stay with paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: Low risk (-1 if wrong), good reward (+1 if right against paper)\n   - Playing paper again: High risk (-3 if they play scissors), high reward (+3 if they play rock)\n   - Playing rock: Low risk (-1 or -3 depending on their move)\n\n5. Decision: Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might expect me to either repeat paper or switch to rock.

Pattern analysis of their responses to my wins:\n   - When I won with scissors (vs their paper), they immediately countered with rock\n   - This suggests they adapt quickly after I succeed\n   - They're not just following a preset pattern - they're actively counter-playing\n\n3. Their complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock\n   - After playing paper twice (rounds 9-10), they switched to rock (round 11)\n   - This rock was specifically to counter my successful scissors\n\n4. Meta-game insight:\n   - They seem to identify what worked for me and immediately counter it\n   - When I played rock repeatedly, they punished with paper\n   - When I found success with scissors, they switched to rock\n   - I need to think one level deeper\n\n5. Reverse psychology approach:\n   - They just played rock to counter my scissors\n   - They might expect me to now switch to paper (to beat rock)\n   - Or they might stick with rock if they think I'll keep trying scissors\n   - But if I play paper and they anticipate this, they'll play scissors\n\n6. Decision: I'll play paper. They just used rock to counter my scissors success, and the natural progression would be for me to counter their rock with paper for the high-value +3 points.

Critical observation about ties:\n   - I've now tied with ALL three moves: rock, paper, and scissors\n   - Each tie happened when we both chose the same move\n   - Ties are keeping me from losing more points - they're actually helping me\n\n3.

Counter-strategy recognition:\n   - They played Rock to beat my Scissors\n   - Then played Scissors to beat my Paper\n   - They might continue this counter-punching approach\n   - Or they might expect me to retreat to safer plays\n\n5. Options assessment:\n   - Rock: Safe against scissors, loses big (-3) to paper\n   - Paper: Risky after just losing with it\n   - Scissors: Just lost with this too\n   - Maybe return to defensive/tie-seeking mode?\n\n6. Decision: I'll play rock. After losing with both scissors and paper in consecutive rounds, rock is the remaining option. If they continue their counter-punching with scissors (expecting me to be aggressive), rock wins +1. If they play paper to punish rock (like they used to), I lose -3, but if they play rock, we tie. I need to stop the bleeding and rock feels like the most defensive choice right now.\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Disaster! They've gone back to punishing my rock plays with paper for maximum damage.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Catastrophic situation:\n   - Just lost -3 points (rock vs paper) - the worst possible loss\n   - Total score: -15 points (my lowest point ever!)\n   - They've now punished all three of my moves in consecutive rounds\n   - Back to the devastating paper-beats-rock pattern\n\n2. Complete counter-sequence:\n   - Round 20: My Scissors \u2192 Their Rock (-1)\n   - Round 21: My Paper \u2192 Their Scissors (-1)  \n   - Round 22: My Rock \u2192 Their Paper (-3)\n   - They systematically countered every move I made!\n\n3. Strategic realization:\n   - They've returned to their early-game strategy of punishing my rock with paper\n   - They're reading my moves perfectly and always one step ahead\n   - Every time I think I've found a pattern, they counter it\n   - I'm back to being completely outmaneuvered\n\n4. Psychological state:\n   - I'm at my worst score ever: -15 points\n   - They've demonstrated they can counter any strategy I try\n   - The brief success I had (tie streaks, 2 wins) has been completely erased\n   - I need to find something completely different\n\n5. Desperate analysis:\n   - They just played paper (expecting my rock tendency)\n   - They might continue with paper if they think I'll play rock again\n   - Or they might cycle to something else\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1), but they might expect this obvious counter\n\n6. Decision: I have nothing left to lose at -15 points. I'll play scissors. If they continue with paper (thinking I'll be afraid to play rock after the -3 loss), scissors could get me +1. Even if they counter with rock, it's only -1, which is far better than the -3 disasters I keep taking.\n\n[move] scissors"
