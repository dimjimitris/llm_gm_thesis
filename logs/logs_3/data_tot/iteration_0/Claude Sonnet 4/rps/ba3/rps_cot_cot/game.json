Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - This makes paper a strong opening move to capitalize on this tendency\n   - The high reward (+3) for paper beating rock makes it worth the risk\n\n5.

Critical observation about ties:\n   - I've now tied with ALL three moves: rock, paper, and scissors\n   - Each tie happened when we both chose the same move\n   - Ties are keeping me from losing more points - they're actually helping me\n\n3. Their recent behavior:\n   - Last 4 moves: Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - They seem to be matching my strategic thinking more often\n   - When I played paper (round 12), they played paper\n   - When I played scissors (round 13), they played scissors\n\n4. Psychological insight:\n   - They might be mirroring my moves or arriving at similar conclusions\n   - Or they're expecting me to repeat successful patterns\n   - The ties suggest we're thinking similarly in some rounds\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since scissors just tied, they might expect me to switch\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n   - Rock beats scissors, paper loses to scissors, scissors ties with scissors\n\n6. Risk analysis:\n   - If I play rock and they repeat scissors: +1 point (finally a win!)\n   - If I play rock and they switch to paper: -3 points (disaster)\n   - If I play scissors again and they play scissors: 0 points (safe tie)\n\nGiven that ties have been saving me from worse losses, and I desperately need a win, I'll risk playing rock to beat their potential scissors repeat.\n\n[move] rock"

Key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3/-3), while rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper only give +1/-1. This creates an asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n3.

Key observation:\n   - When I played rock twice (rounds 6-7), they went Rock then Paper\n   - When I played scissors (round 8), they also played scissors\n   - Maybe they're mirroring or adapting to my recent choices\n\n4. Strategic analysis:\n   - They just played scissors, same as me\n   - If they continue mirroring, they might expect me to stay with scissors\n   - Or they might switch to rock to counter scissors\n   - Less likely to play paper after just using it in round 7\n\n5.

Decision: I'll play rock. They just played scissors, and rock is the natural counter. If they mirror my previous scissors choice and play scissors again, I win +1. If they try to counter-predict and play paper, I lose -3, but given they just used paper recently, this seems less likely.\n\n[move] rock",

Tie streak analysis:\n   - Just tied rock vs rock (0 points)\n   - Total score: -12 points (stable for 5 rounds now)\n   - This is my 5th tie out of 14 rounds\n   - Recent pattern: Paper tie, Scissors tie, Rock tie\n\n2. Major pattern recognition:\n   - I've now tied with rock, paper, AND scissors in recent rounds\n   - We seem to be synchronizing our thought processes\n   - Ties are much better than my previous -1 and -3 losses\n\n3. Their recent moves matching mine:\n   - Round 12: Both played paper\n   - Round 13: Both played scissors  \n   - Round 14: Both played rock\n   - They're either mirroring me or we're thinking very similarly\n\n4. Strategic revelation:\n   - When I focus on logical, straightforward moves, we tie\n   - When I overthink or try complex predictions, I lose\n   - Ties are actually a good outcome given my terrible score\n\n5. Next move consideration:\n   - If this mirroring continues, whatever I choose, they might choose too\n   - But I can't assume they'll always mirror\n   - I should pick the move that gives me the best risk/reward if they don't mirror\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - If I play paper and they mirror: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play paper and they don't mirror but play rock: +3 points (huge win!)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: -1 point (manageable loss)\n\nI'll play paper. If the mirroring continues, it's a safe tie. If they break the pattern, paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) with moderate risk.\n\n[move] paper",

Performance review:\n   - Had an amazing run: 6 ties \u2192 2 wins \u2192 1 tie \u2192 1 loss\n   - Went from -12 to -10, now back to -11\n   - I've proven I can compete and win when I think strategically\n\n3. Opponent's recent adaptation:\n   - They've started countering my moves more effectively again\n   - After I won twice, they're being more unpredictable\n   - They played Rock to beat my Scissors (smart counter)\n\n4. Key learning:\n   - The tie pattern worked for stability\n   - Breaking patterns worked for wins\n   - But I can't get too predictable in my unpredictability\n   - Need to stay one step ahead\n\n5. Strategic recalibration:\n   - They just played Rock (beat my Scissors)\n   - They might expect me to now play Paper (to beat Rock)\n   - Or they might stick with Rock if they think it's working\n   - Could also switch to Scissors or Paper\n\n6. Decision: I'll play Paper. They just successfully used Rock against me, and the natural counter is Paper for +3 points. This is a high-risk, high-reward play. If they expect this and play Scissors, I lose -1. If they stick with Rock or play Rock again, I get +3. Given my recent success with bold moves, I'll take this calculated risk.\n\n[move] paper",
