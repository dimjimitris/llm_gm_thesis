    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Strategic considerations:\n   - Paper is the most valuable winning move (+3 points)\n   - But paper also has the highest penalty if I lose (-3 points)\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they might not realize paper's special value\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: High reward (+3) but high risk (-3 if they play scissors)\n   - Playing rock or scissors: Lower reward (+1) but lower risk (-1)\n\n5. First move strategy:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player who may not understand the payoff asymmetry\n   - They might play randomly or follow common tendencies (many people start with rock)\n   - Paper seems like a good choice due to its high payoff potential\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to maximize potential points, betting that a fresh player won't immediately target it with scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

Update my assessment of the opponent:\n   - They chose paper first, showing they grasp the asymmetric payoffs\n   - This suggests they're strategic and will likely continue targeting high-value moves\n   - They might expect me to play paper again or try to counter it\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they might play scissors to counter (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - If they want to go for high value again, they might play paper again\n   - They might try rock as a \"safe\" middle option\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - Paper: High reward but they might counter with scissors\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (which they favor) for +1, loses to rock for -1\n   - Rock: Beats scissors for +1, loses badly to paper for -3\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they showed paper preference, scissors could counter them well\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 1 point (not 3)\n   - Scissors gives me the best chance to capitalize on their paper tendency\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their apparent preference for paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze what happened in Round 9:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - I won 1 point (+1), opponent lost 1 point\n   - My total score is now +3 points (was +2, gained +1)\n\n2. Review the complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: Me(paper) vs Them(paper) = Tie (0)\n   - Round 2: Me(scissors) vs Them(rock) = I lose (-1)\n   - Round 3: Me(paper) vs Them(scissors) = I lose (-1)\n   - Round 4: Me(scissors) vs Them(paper) = I win (+1)\n   - Round 5: Me(paper) vs Them(rock) = I win (+3)\n   - Round 6: Me(rock) vs Them(rock) = Tie (0)\n   - Round 7: Me(paper) vs Them(scissors) = I lose (-1)\n   - Round 8: Me(rock) vs Them(scissors) = I win (+1)\n   - Round 9: Me(scissors) vs Them(paper) = I win (+1)\n\n3. Identify my recent success:\n   - I've won 3 rounds in a row (rounds 7, 8, 9)\n   - I correctly predicted their moves by reading their counter-strategy\n   - My adaptation away from predictable paper-heavy play is working\n\n4. Analyze opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: rock, scissors, scissors, paper\n   - They went for the high-value paper play after I beat them with rock\n   - They're trying to counter my moves but I'm staying one step ahead\n\n5. Current position assessment:\n   - I'm significantly ahead at +3 points\n   - I have momentum with 3 consecutive wins\n   - The opponent is likely frustrated and may become more unpredictable\n\n6. Consider opponent's likely mindset:\n   - They just lost their third straight round\n   - They tried the high-value paper strategy and it backfired\n   - They might become more conservative or try to disrupt my winning streak\n   - They could expect me to be overconfident and make a predictable move\n\n7. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors again (since it just worked)\n   - If so, they'd play rock to counter scissors\n   - They might also try paper again for the +3 value, thinking I won't expect it twice\n   - Or they could play scissors, thinking I'll switch to rock or paper\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - I'm ahead, so I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - If they play rock (countering expected scissors), paper gives me +3\n   - If they play paper again, scissors wins again\n   - If they play scissors, rock wins\n   - Given their likely frustration, they might go conservative with rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting they'll play rock to counter my recent scissors success, giving me the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] paper"

Identify my dominant streak:\n   - I've now won 4 rounds in a row (rounds 7, 8, 9, 10)\n   - I'm significantly ahead at +6 points\n   - I've successfully predicted their moves 4 consecutive times\n\n4. Analyze my successful strategy pattern:\n   - Round 8: Played rock, they played scissors (I countered their aggression)\n   - Round 9: Played scissors, they played paper (I countered their high-value attempt)\n   - Round 10: Played paper, they played rock (I countered their conservative response)\n   - I've been successfully reading their counter-strategies\n\n5. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They've lost 4 straight rounds\n   - They just lost the maximum 3 points again\n   - They're likely very frustrated and desperate\n   - Their strategy of trying to counter my moves has completely failed\n\n6. Predict opponent's mindset and likely move:\n   - They might be overthinking at this point\n   - They could try to \"reset\" with a random move\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it just gave me +3)\n   - If so, they'd play scissors to counter paper\n   - Alternatively, they might think I'll switch strategies given my big lead\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - I have a commanding +6 point lead\n   - I can afford to be more conservative\n   - But I should also be wary of becoming overconfident and predictable\n   - The opponent is desperate and might make an unexpected move\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - If they expect paper and play scissors, rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play rock again (being conservative), paper gives me another +3\n   - If they play paper (going for broke), scissors beats it (+1 for me)\n   - Rock seems like the safest choice that still gives positive expected value\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to counter a likely scissors response to my recent paper success, while maintaining a safe strategy given my large lead.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's desperation pattern:\n   - Their last 5 moves: rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 8 and 11)\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves frantically\n   - They correctly predicted I'd play paper in round 10 but still chose the losing rock\n\n5. Consider the opponent's current state:\n   - They're in complete disarray, having lost 5 straight\n   - They're probably second-guessing everything\n   - They might be getting desperate and making increasingly irrational choices\n   - Or they might try something completely unexpected to break the pattern\n\n6. Analyze my successful prediction pattern:\n   - I've been reading their counter-strategies perfectly\n   - They keep trying to counter my previous successful moves\n   - Round 11: They played scissors (probably expecting paper after my +3 win)\n   - They're still trying to counter my moves rather than playing independently\n\n7. Predict their next move:\n   - They just played scissors and lost to my rock\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just worked)\n   - If so, they should play paper for the +3 bonus\n   - But they've been bad at executing optimal counter-strategies\n   - They might also just play randomly out of frustration\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - I have a massive +7 point lead\n   - I can afford to take some risk for a big payoff\n   - If they play the optimal counter (paper to beat expected rock), scissors wins\n   - If they play rock or scissors, my move matters less for maintaining the lead\n   - Given their pattern of trying to counter my successful moves, paper seems likely from them\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll try to counter my successful rock with paper for the high-value play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Strategic assessment:\n   - I have an overwhelming +8 point lead\n   - I could play more conservatively and still maintain dominance\n   - But the opponent seems so predictable right now that I might as well capitalize\n   - If they play rock (countering expected scissors), paper gives me +3\n   - If they play scissors or paper, other moves work fine\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent has shown consistent counter-predictive behavior\n   - They're likely to play rock thinking I'll repeat scissors\n   - Paper vs rock gives me the maximum +3 points\n   - Even if I'm wrong, my lead is so large it doesn't matter much\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting them to play rock in an attempt to counter my successful scissors.\n\n[move] paper"
