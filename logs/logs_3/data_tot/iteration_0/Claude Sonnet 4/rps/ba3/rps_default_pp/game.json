This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might play randomly or go with common first instincts. Many people instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors.\n\nGiven the high payoff for paper beating rock, and the reasonable probability that a fresh player might choose rock, I'll go with paper for maximum expected value.\n\n[move] paper"

They didn't choose the \"typical beginner\" move of rock\n2. They either got lucky with a random choice, or they anticipated that I might play paper (perhaps thinking about the high payoff of paper vs rock)\n\nFor this second round, I need to consider:\n- If they're playing randomly, any move has equal probability\n- If they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to switch to rock (to counter their scissors)\n- The payoff matrix still favors paper when it wins\n\nSince scissors just worked for them, they might stick with it, or they might think I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors. If they expect me to play rock, they'd want to play paper for the big +3 payoff.\n\nI'll go with rock this time - it beats scissors (in case they repeat) and loses to paper, but the paper loss is only -3 while a rock win against scissors is +1.\n\n[move] rock"

This gives me more information about my opponent's thinking:\n\nRound 1: They played scissors (beat my paper)\nRound 2: They played rock (tied with my rock)\n\nThis suggests they might be thinking strategically rather than playing randomly. The sequence scissors \u2192 rock could indicate they're trying to counter what they think I'll play next, or they're following some pattern.\n\nNow for round 3, I need to consider:\n- They've played scissors, then rock\n- If they're following rock-paper-scissors order, paper might be next\n- If they're trying to counter what they think I'll play, they might anticipate my next move\n- The high payoff for paper beating rock is still very attractive\n\nGiven that they went scissors \u2192 rock, if they continue any kind of sequence, paper would be logical next. But if they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go back to scissors or stick with rock.\n\nI think I'll play scissors this time. If they play paper (continuing a potential sequence), I win +1.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
