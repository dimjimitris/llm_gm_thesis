The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

They've now won 7 out of the last 8 rounds against me.\n\nI need to completely change my approach. All my pattern-seeking, strategic thinking, and attempts to predict them have failed. They seem to be one step ahead of whatever reasoning I use.\n\nMaybe the key insight is this: they're clearly better at this meta-game than I am. So instead of trying to out-think them, maybe I should try to be genuinely unpredictable - not following any strategy that could be detected.\n\nThey just played paper. In the past, when I've tried to counter or predict, it's backfired. Let me try something different: instead of thinking about what they might do, let me just pick based on what feels right in the moment without strategic reasoning.\n\nScissors.
