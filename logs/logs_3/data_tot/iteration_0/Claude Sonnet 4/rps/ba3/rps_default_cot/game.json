Make strategic decision:\n   - Given that fresh players commonly choose Rock\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors playing Paper against a new player\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 10: I won with Paper, opponent played Rock\n   - Round 11: I played Rock (expecting Scissors), opponent played Paper\n   - They broke their 6-round pattern of countering my previous winning move!\n   - Instead of playing Scissors to counter my Paper, they played Paper to counter my expected Rock\n\n2. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - The opponent may have finally recognized they were being predictable\n   - Or they're evolving to a more complex strategy\n   - They correctly predicted I would expect Scissors and played Paper instead\n   - This cost me -3 points (the maximum penalty)\n\n3. Current score assessment:\n   - Previous total: +9 points\n   - This round: -3 points  \n   - New total: +6 points\n   - Still ahead overall, but the opponent showed they can adapt\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just won with Paper against my Rock\n   - Will they return to the old pattern and expect me to counter their Paper with Scissors?\n   - Or will they continue with a new unpredictable strategy?\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors to counter their winning Paper\n\n5. Strategic recalibration:\n   - I can no longer assume the simple reactive pattern\n   - The opponent has shown they can think one level deeper\n   - I need to consider what they think I think they'll do\n\n6. Evaluate options:\n   - If they expect me to play Scissors (countering their Paper): they might play Rock\n   - If they think I'll be cautious and not assume patterns: they might repeat Paper\n   - If they return to old pattern: they might play Scissors (countering my Rock)\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - Since they just demonstrated higher-level thinking, they likely expect me to counter their Paper\n   - They probably expect Scissors from me, so they'll play Rock\n   - I should play Paper to beat their expected Rock\n\n[move] Paper"

Review the recent game development:\n   - Round 10: I won with Paper, opponent played Rock (+3 points)\n   - Round 11: I played Rock, opponent played Paper (I lost -3 points)  \n   - Round 12: I played Paper, opponent played Rock (I won +3 points)\n   - Current total: +9 points (back to where I was)\n\n2. Analyze the new pattern that's emerging:\n   - The opponent broke their simple reactive pattern in round 11\n   - But in round 12, they played Rock again (same as round 10 and 11)\n   - They seem to be favoring Rock recently (3 out of last 3 rounds)\n   - This might indicate a new strategy or preference\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They just lost with Rock against my Paper\n   - They might expect me to repeat Paper (since it just won with +3)\n   - If they expect Paper from me, they should play Scissors to counter it\n   - Or they might stick with Rock if they think I'll switch away from Paper\n\n4. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - The opponent showed they can break patterns and think strategically\n   - They successfully predicted my move in round 11\n   - I successfully counter-predicted them in round 12\n   - This is now a higher-level psychological game\n\n5. Strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Scissors (countering expected Paper): I should play Rock (+1)\n   - If opponent plays Rock again (sticking with recent preference): I should play Paper (+3)\n   - If opponent plays Paper (trying to counter my expected Rock): I should play Scissors (+1)\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper vs Rock gives maximum reward (+3) if they stick with Rock preference\n   - Rock vs Scissors gives safer reward (+1) if they counter my expected Paper\n   - The opponent has played Rock 3 times in a row now\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - The opponent's recent Rock preference suggests they might play Rock again\n   - I'll take the high-reward gamble and play Paper again\n   - Even if wrong, I'm still significantly ahead in points\n\n[move] Paper"

Strategic options remaining:\n   - Continue the futile attempt to break unbreakable mirroring\n   - Accept the elegant stalemate they've created\n   - Make peace with being outplayed in this phase while still winning overall\n\n6.
