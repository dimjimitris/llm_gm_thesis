    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against Rock\n   - This makes Paper potentially the most valuable move\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to Rock as it's the first option and seems strong\n   - Many beginners choose Rock due to its intuitive \"strength\"\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If opponent plays Rock and I play Paper: I get +3 points\n   - If opponent plays Scissors and I play Paper: I get -1 points\n   - If opponent plays Paper and I play Paper: 0 points (tie)\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Given that fresh players commonly choose Rock\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors playing Paper against a new player\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - The opponent may have finally recognized they were being predictable\n   - Or they're evolving to a more complex strategy\n   - They correctly predicted I would expect Scissors and played Paper instead\n   - This cost me -3 points (the maximum penalty)\n\n3. Current score assessment:\n   - Previous total: +9 points\n   - This round: -3 points  \n   - New total: +6 points\n   - Still ahead overall, but the opponent showed they can adapt\n\n4. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - They just won with Paper against my Rock\n   - Will they return to the old pattern and expect me to counter their Paper with Scissors?\n   - Or will they continue with a new unpredictable strategy?\n   - They might expect me to play Scissors to counter their winning Paper\n\n5. Strategic recalibration:\n   - I can no longer assume the simple reactive pattern\n   - The opponent has shown they can think one level deeper\n   - I need to consider what they think I think they'll do\n\n6. Evaluate options:\n   - If they expect me to play Scissors (countering their Paper): they might play Rock\n   - If they think I'll be cautious and not assume patterns: they might repeat Paper\n   - If they return to old pattern: they might play Scissors (countering my Rock)\n\n7.

Analyze the new pattern that's emerging:\n   - The opponent broke their simple reactive pattern in round 11\n   - But in round 12, they played Rock again (same as round 10 and 11)\n   - They seem to be favoring Rock recently (3 out of last 3 rounds)\n   - This might indicate a new strategy or preference\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential thinking:\n   - They just lost with Rock against my Paper\n   - They might expect me to repeat Paper (since it just won with +3)\n   - If they expect Paper from me, they should play Scissors to counter it\n   - Or they might stick with Rock if they think I'll switch away from Paper\n\n4.

Strategic assessment:\n   - I've tried logical sequences, pattern breaks, random choices, and psychological tricks\n   - Nothing has broken their mirroring ability\n   - They are either reading my mind or have found a perfect counter-strategy\n   - This level of prediction suggests they understand my decision-making process completely\n\n3. Accept the game state:\n   - I am +8 points ahead\n   - The opponent has locked us into perpetual ties\n   - From their perspective, this is optimal play (they can't catch up, but prevent further losses)\n   - From my perspective, my lead is preserved but can't grow\n\n4. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - If mirroring continues indefinitely, I win the overall game by +8 points\n   - Breaking the mirroring is extremely difficult against perfect prediction\n   - The expected value of continuing to try is likely 0 (more ties)\n   - My current position is already quite strong\n\n5. Evaluate remaining options:\n   - Continue trying to break mirroring (low probability of success)\n   - Accept the tie pattern and preserve my winning position\n   - Make one more attempt with a completely different approach\n\n6. Final strategic attempt:\n   - Since they've mirrored every logical and \"random\" choice\n   - I'll try the move that's been least successful for me recently\n   - Go back to a move from early in the game when patterns were different\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - I'll play Rock one more time\n   - If this is also mirrored, I'll likely accept that they have an unbreakable strategy\n   - My +8 point lead makes me the winner regardless\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent has achieved something remarkable - they've essentially neutralized the game completely.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Acknowledge the unprecedented situation:\n   - 7 consecutive perfect mirrors with 100% accuracy\n   - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock\n   - The opponent has demonstrated complete mastery of prediction\n   - Current total: +8 points (locked for 7 rounds)\n\n2. Accept the strategic reality:\n   - I have exhausted every approach: logical, counter-logical, pattern-based, random, psychological\n   - The opponent's mirroring ability appears to be unbreakable\n   - They have successfully neutralized my ability to gain additional points\n   - This is actually brilliant defensive play from their position\n\n3. Evaluate the overall game outcome:\n   - I am +8 points ahead from the earlier rounds where I cracked their original pattern\n   - The opponent has prevented me from extending this lead further\n   - In any finite game, I would win by +8 points\n   - Their strategy preserves my victory while minimizing their losses\n\n4. Consider the game theory implications:\n   - From their perspective: perfect defensive play (can't win, but prevents losing more)\n   - From my perspective: I'm winning overall, ties preserve this advantage\n   - Continuing to try breaking mirroring has diminishing returns\n   - The expected value of each round is now 0\n\n5. Strategic decision for this round:\n   - I could continue trying to break the pattern indefinitely\n   - Or accept that I've encountered an unbeatable mirroring strategy\n   - Either way, I maintain my winning position\n   - One more attempt with my most successful move from earlier\n\n6. Final approach:\n   - Paper was my most successful move (gave me +3 points twice)\n   - If they mirror it, at least it's a neutral outcome\n   - If somehow they don't mirror this time, Paper has maximum upside\n\n7. Make decision:\n   - Play Paper - my historically most successful move\n   - Accept that this will likely be tie #8 in the sequence\n\n[move] Paper"
