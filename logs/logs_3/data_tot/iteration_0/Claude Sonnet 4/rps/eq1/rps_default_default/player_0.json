    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

            "text": "Excellent! I correctly predicted they'd switch to scissors after losing with rock, and my rock beat their scissors. Updated record:\n\nRound 1: Both rock (tie)\nRound 2: Both paper (tie)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\nRound 4: Both paper (tie)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\nRound 6: Both rock (tie)\nRound 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\nRound 8: Both rock (tie)\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\nRound 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\nRound 14: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\nRound 15: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\nRound 18: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 19: Both rock (tie)\nRound 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\nRound 21: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +1)\nRound 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n\nMy opponent's sequence: rock, paper, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors\n\nCurrent score: +6 points total\n\nThe pattern is very clear now! When they lose with rock, they often switch to scissors:\n- Round 15: switched to scissors after rock losses\n- Round 18: switched to scissors after rock losses  \n- Round 21: switched to scissors after rock losses\n- Round 23: switched to scissors after rock loss\n\nUpdated frequencies:\n- Rock: 10 times (43%)\n- Scissors: 6 times (26%)\n- Paper: 7 times (30%)\n\nTheir predictable pattern: Rock (dominant choice) \u2192 lose \u2192 switch to scissors \u2192 then usually back to rock.\n\nAfter losing with scissors in round 23, they'll most likely return to their favorite rock. This has been their consistent behavior throughout the game.\n\nI'll play paper to counter their expected return to rock.\n\n[move] paper"
