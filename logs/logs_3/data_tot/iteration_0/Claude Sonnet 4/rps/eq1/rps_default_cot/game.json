In classic game theory for rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to play randomly to avoid being predictable.\n\n4. However, against a \"fresh player,\" there might be some psychological tendencies to consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as their first move (it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some players might overthink and choose paper to beat the expected rock\n   - Others might choose scissors thinking others will choose paper\n\n5. Given that rock is statistically the most common first move among new players, choosing paper would give me the best chance of winning this round.\n\n6.

High-stakes decision:\n   - If they continue the pattern (rock): I should play paper to win my 5th straight\n   - If they break the pattern now: It becomes unpredictable\n   - Their previous behavior suggests they might stick to patterns until hitting 5 losses\n\n5. Risk vs. reward:\n   - Playing paper gives me the win if they follow pattern\n   - The psychological pressure on them is extreme after 9 total losses\n   - But their history shows they can be remarkably persistent with patterns\n\n6. Given that they previously needed exactly 5 consecutive losses to break their first pattern, and they're currently at 4 consecutive losses, I believe they'll likely play rock one more time before potentially breaking the pattern.\n\n7.
