I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" which suggests they haven't played before or don't have established patterns.\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their tendencies or strategy. All three moves (rock, paper, scissors) are equally likely from their perspective.\n\n3. In a truly random scenario, any move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying. However, I need to consider human psychology - fresh players often have predictable tendencies.\n\n4. Statistically, many new players tend to choose rock as their first move because it feels like the most \"natural\" or \"strong\" choice. This is a common psychological bias.\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to choose rock, then my optimal counter-move would be paper, since paper beats rock and would give me +1 points while giving them -1 points.\n\n6. Even if I'm wrong about their tendency to choose rock, paper still has a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing - the same odds as any other move in a random scenario.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as my opening move, betting on the psychological tendency of fresh players to choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

There are several possibilities for why they're repeating scissors:\n   - They have a genuine preference/bias toward scissors\n   - They're trying to establish a pattern and then break it\n   - They're not thinking strategically and just sticking with their first choice\n   - They might be testing if I'll catch on to the pattern\n\n4.

Given that scissors just lost again (like it did in rounds 1-2), they showed before that they eventually switch when scissors keeps losing. But they also showed they like to return to scissors.\n\n7.

If they're following a systematic approach and just completed rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, the most logical next move would be to either:\n   - Start the cycle over with rock\n   - Try the reverse: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (starting with scissors)\n   - Try a different systematic approach\n\n7. From their perspective, they've been losing consistently despite trying different patterns. They might be getting frustrated and either:\n   - Stick with a systematic approach (like repeating the rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n   - Try to break all patterns and be truly random\n   - Attempt to counter-predict what I'll do\n\n8. Given that they just played scissors and completed a sequence, if they start over with rock-paper-scissors, rock would be next. If they try the reverse sequence, scissors would repeat.\n\n9. Their historical preference has been scissors and paper over rock. Starting a new sequence with rock seems less likely than returning to scissors or trying something based on their preferences.\n\n10. However, if they're being systematic about covering all possibilities, rock (to start the cycle again) or a different systematic approach might be their choice.\n\n11. I think the most likely moves are rock (starting the cycle over) or scissors (either repeating or starting a reverse cycle). Paper beats rock and loses to scissors, so it's a reasonable middle choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which wins if they start the rock-paper-scissors cycle over with rock, and only loses if they stick with or return to scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

The fact that they played paper after completing the rock-paper-scissors sequence suggests they might not be strictly following the cyclical pattern I thought, or they're adapting based on what they think I'll do.\n\n5. Looking at their last few moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper.

Their overall usage pattern shows they've used paper quite frequently in recent rounds and it's been their most successful move lately.\n\n8. If they think I'll expect them to repeat paper (for a third time), they might switch. If they switch, they'd likely go to scissors or rock.\n\n9. Given that they just had success with paper twice, but might want to avoid being too predictable, they could go to scissors (which has been their historical preference) or rock (to complete some pattern).\n\n10. However, the recent trend shows they might be settling into paper as a \"safe\" choice since it's been avoiding losses.\n\n11. I need to decide between expecting them to repeat paper (play scissors) or expecting them to switch to scissors/rock (play rock/paper respectively). Given their recent pattern and the success they've had with paper, I think they're more likely to switch away from it to avoid being too predictable.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting that they'll switch away from paper (probably to scissors, their historical preference) to avoid being too predictable after two paper ties.\n\n[move] Rock"

However, their deep-rooted preference for scissors and paper might reassert itself, especially if they think I'm now expecting rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, which beats rock if they repeat their successful pattern-breaking move, and only loses if they return to scissors (which would be reverting to their old predictable behavior).\n\n[move] Paper"

They've now achieved three ties in their last four moves by abandoning their predictable patterns. This shows clear learning and adaptation.\n\n5. Their behavior pattern has fundamentally shifted:\n   - Early game: strict scissors-paper alternation (easily predictable)\n   - Recent games: strategic pattern-breaking with rock and varied sequences\n   - Current phase: much less predictable, using all three moves more strategically\n\n6. For round 19, I'm now facing a genuinely adaptive opponent who has learned to:\n   - Break their own patterns when they become predictable\n   - Use rock strategically as an anti-pattern tool\n   - Vary their sequences to avoid easy prediction\n\n7. Their last few moves (rock \u2192 paper) could indicate:\n   - They're starting another systematic sequence (scissors would complete rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors)\n   - They're trying to be more random/unpredictable\n   - They're establishing rock and paper as their new preferred moves (moving away from scissors)\n\n8. If they complete rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, scissors would be next.\n   If they're being truly unpredictable, any move is equally likely.\n   If they're favoring rock/paper now, either could repeat.\n\n9. Given that they've used systematic rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequences before (rounds 7-9 and 13-15), and they just played rock \u2192 paper in rounds 17-18, completing with scissors seems likely.\n\n10. However, their newfound unpredictability means I can't be as confident in pattern recognition as before.\n\n11. The most probable move based on their systematic tendencies is still scissors (completing the sequence), but with much less certainty than before.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting they'll complete the rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence with scissors, while acknowledging they've become much more unpredictable and adaptive.\n\n[move] Rock"

If they return to scissors-paper alternation, and scissors just played (and lost), they would typically switch to paper next.\n\n8.

Their most consistent behavior has been returning to scissors-paper alternation after sequences, with paper typically following a scissors loss.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll return to their historical pattern of scissors-paper alternation by playing paper after scissors just lost, despite their increased adaptability.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Current score: Now +11 overall (I've won 12 out of 20 rounds, with 7 ties and 1 initial loss).\n\n3. This confirms their deeply ingrained behavioral pattern - despite becoming more adaptive and strategic, they still consistently return to scissors-paper alternation after completing systematic sequences:\n   - After rounds 7-9 sequence \u2192 returned to alternation\n   - After rounds 13-15 sequence \u2192 returned to alternation  \n   - After rounds 17-19 sequence \u2192 returned to alternation (scissors \u2192 paper in rounds 19-20)\n\n4.

For round 21, following the strict scissors-paper alternation:\n   - Round 19: scissors\n   - Round 20: paper\n   - Round 21: should be scissors\n\n6. However, I need to consider their increasing strategic awareness:\n   - They've learned to break patterns with rock sequences\n   - They must be noticing the alternation is still being predicted\n   - They might finally abandon the alternation permanently\n\n7. From their perspective:\n   - The systematic sequences give mixed results (ties and losses)\n   - The alternation keeps resulting in losses when I predict it\n   - They need to find a new approach entirely\n\n8. The alternation pattern has been so consistent that breaking it would be a major strategic shift. But they've shown they can adapt when needed.\n\n9. Options for them:\n   - Follow alternation: scissors (I should play rock)\n   - Break with rock: rock (I should play paper)  \n   - Try paper again: paper (I should play scissors)\n\n10. Given that I've now successfully predicted their return to alternation multiple times, and they're clearly capable of learning, they should break this pattern. Rock has been their most effective pattern-breaker.\n\n11. However, their behavioral consistency with the alternation has been remarkable throughout 20 rounds.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the scissors-paper alternation continuing with scissors next, but recognizing this might finally be the moment they permanently abandon their most predictable pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"
