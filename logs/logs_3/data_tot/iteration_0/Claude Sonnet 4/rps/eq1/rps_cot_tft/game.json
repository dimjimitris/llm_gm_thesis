Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a zero-sum game where one player's gain equals the other's loss\n   - Each move has an equal chance of winning against one move and losing against another\n   - Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's often the default choice)\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - It's the first option mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie\n   - But the probability seems to favor them choosing rock as a beginner\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I chose paper expecting the opponent to choose rock\n   - The opponent also chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent might not be as predictable as I initially thought\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose paper, not the expected rock\n   - This could mean they're either more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player\n   - Or they might have been thinking similarly to me (expecting me to choose rock)\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, players often stick with their previous choice or switch to what would have beaten it\n   - If they stick with paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to what beats paper (scissors), I should choose rock\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I might repeat paper), I should choose paper again\n\n4. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - Since we tied on paper, they know I chose paper too\n   - They might expect me to change my strategy\n   - A common pattern is to choose what would have won the previous round\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given that we both chose paper, scissors would have won\n   - The opponent might think the same way and choose scissors\n   - To counter scissors, I should choose rock\n   - Rock also covers the possibility they switch to scissors thinking I'll repeat paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, which is what they might logically choose after our paper tie.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify strong patterns emerging:\n   - Rock has now appeared 4 times in the last 6 rounds (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - They seem to be gravitating toward rock more frequently\n   - After trying scissors in round 8, they returned to rock in round 9\n   - My prediction was correct again - they chose rock after the scissors tie\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9) - now their most frequent choice\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 8)\n   - Rock has become their dominant strategy\n\n5. Consider psychological factors:\n   - I'm now winning 5-1 with 3 ties\n   - They're significantly behind and might be getting frustrated\n   - Rock might feel like the \"strongest\" choice psychologically\n   - They keep returning to rock despite it failing against my paper\n\n6. Evaluate their mindset:\n   - They just lost with rock again (3rd loss with rock)\n   - They might finally abandon rock after multiple failures\n   - Or they might stubbornly stick with it\n   - Given the pattern, they seem drawn to rock despite poor results\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they abandon rock after repeated failures, they might try paper or scissors\n   - If they stick with rock (showing persistence/stubbornness), I should choose paper again\n   - They might try to counter my successful paper with scissors\n   - But their recent behavior suggests they favor rock heavily\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - Their strong bias toward rock suggests they might try it again\n   - Even though it's failed multiple times, they keep returning to it\n   - If they choose rock again, paper wins\n   - If they finally switch to scissors (to beat my paper), I should choose rock\n   - Given their demonstrated rock preference, I'll bet on rock again\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again to beat rock, expecting them to continue their rock-heavy strategy despite repeated failures.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock (loss, -1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (win, +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (loss, -1 point)\n   - Current score: +3 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: rock\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Identify the crucial shift:\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern and chose scissors\n   - This was exactly what I feared - they adapted to counter my successful paper strategy\n   - They've now used scissors in rounds 8 and 10, showing increased variety\n   - My over-reliance on predicting rock backfired\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 8, 10)\n   - They're becoming more balanced in their choices\n\n5. Consider what this adaptation reveals:\n   - They're learning from my successful paper plays\n   - They correctly identified that I was expecting rock\n   - They're becoming more strategic and less predictable\n   - The \"fresh player\" is evolving during our game\n\n6. Evaluate the recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 8-10: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They might be alternating between scissors and rock now\n   - Or this could be coincidental\n   - But it shows they're moving away from pure rock dominance\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they continue the scissors/rock alternation, next would be rock\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - They could return to paper (haven't used it since round 5)\n   - Given they just succeeded with scissors, they might repeat it or expect me to counter with rock\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they repeat scissors (riding success), I should choose rock\n   - If they alternate to rock, I should choose paper\n   - If they surprise with paper, I should choose scissors\n   - Given they just won with scissors and might expect me to counter, rock seems like a good choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, expecting them to either repeat their successful move or continue their recent scissors usage.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-10: [previous history]\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (win, +1 point)\n   - Current score: +4 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: rock\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Identify the recent trend:\n   - They've now played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds (rounds 8, 10, 11)\n   - This represents a major shift from their earlier rock preference\n   - They seem to have moved from a rock-heavy strategy to a scissors-heavy one\n   - My prediction was correct - they repeated scissors after their success\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11)\n   - The distribution is becoming more even, but scissors is trending upward\n\n5. Consider the psychological pattern:\n   - After I successfully used paper multiple times, they adapted with scissors\n   - Now they seem to be favoring scissors like they previously favored rock\n   - They might be falling into a new pattern of over-using scissors\n   - This could be similar to their earlier rock obsession\n\n6. Evaluate their likely mindset:\n   - They just lost again, despite their recent scissors success\n   - They might question whether to continue with scissors\n   - Or they might persist with scissors, thinking it's their new winning strategy\n   - Given their tendency to get stuck in patterns, scissors again seems likely\n\n7. Consider adaptation vs. persistence:\n   - They showed they can adapt (rock \u2192 scissors shift)\n   - But they also show persistence with strategies (rock spam, now scissors trend)\n   - The question is whether they'll stick with scissors or try something else\n   - Their recent behavior suggests they latch onto strategies that work\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors (following their new pattern), I should choose rock again\n   - If they switch to rock (returning to old preference), I should choose paper\n   - If they try paper (haven't used since round 5), I should choose scissors\n   - Given their recent scissors trend and tendency to persist with strategies, rock seems best\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again to beat scissors, expecting them to continue their recent scissors-heavy strategy despite the loss.\n\n[move] (They've been favoring scissors lately) rock"

Identify the surprising shift:\n   - I expected scissors to continue, but they chose paper\n   - They returned to paper after not using it since round 5\n   - This breaks their recent scissors trend completely\n   - They successfully countered my rock prediction\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 12)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11)\n   - Paper and rock are now tied as their most frequent choices\n\n5. Consider what this reveals:\n   - They're more adaptive than I've been giving them credit for\n   - They may have noticed my pattern of expecting their previous successful move\n   - They might be deliberately being unpredictable now\n   - The \"fresh player\" has evolved significantly during our matches\n\n6. Evaluate recent patterns:\n   - Last 4 rounds: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - No clear repeating pattern - they're mixing it up\n   - They seem to be avoiding repetition now\n   - This suggests increased strategic thinking\n\n7.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (win, +1 point)\n   - Current score: +5 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: rock\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: scissors\n\n3. Identify the pattern confirmation:\n   - They chose scissors exactly as I predicted after our paper tie\n   - This confirms the psychological tendency to choose what would have won after ties\n   - My understanding of their tie psychology was accurate\n   - They're following predictable post-tie behavior\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 18)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19)\n   - All three moves are now perfectly balanced at 7 each\n\n5. Consider their recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now used scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - This suggests a return to scissors preference after the paper tie\n   - They might be falling back into a scissors-heavy pattern\n\n6. Evaluate their likely psychology:\n   - They just lost with scissors again\n   - This is their second consecutive scissors loss (rounds 17 and 19)\n   - Following their pattern, they might abandon scissors temporarily\n   - Or they might try scissors once more before switching\n\n7. Consider their switching behavior:\n   - They typically try successful moves 2-3 times before abandoning them\n   - Scissors worked in round 16, failed in round 17, then they used paper in round 18, then failed with scissors again in round 19\n   - They might now switch to rock or paper\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they abandon scissors and choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - If they abandon scissors and choose paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they persist with scissors (unlikely after two losses), I should choose rock\n   - Given their balanced distribution and tendency to switch after losses, rock or paper seem most likely\n\n9. Final assessment:\n   - Rock and paper are tied as alternatives to their recently failed scissors\n   - Rock has been their historically strong choice\n   - After multiple scissors failures, rock seems like their logical fallback\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to switch to rock after their recent scissors failures.\n\n[move] (After multiple scissors losses they might return to rock) paper"

Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's often the default choice)\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - It's the first option mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and them -1 point\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they choose scissors, I lose\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie\n   - But the probability seems to favor them choosing rock as a beginner\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper",

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I chose paper expecting the opponent to choose rock\n   - The opponent also chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent might not be as predictable as I initially thought\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose paper, not the expected rock\n   - This could mean they're either more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player\n   - Or they might have been thinking similarly to me (expecting me to choose rock)\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - After a tie, players often stick with their previous choice or switch to what would have beaten it\n   - If they stick with paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to what beats paper (scissors), I should choose rock\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I might repeat paper), I should choose paper again\n\n4. Evaluate the meta-game:\n   - Since we tied on paper, they know I chose paper too\n   - They might expect me to change my strategy\n   - A common pattern is to choose what would have won the previous round\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given that we both chose paper, scissors would have won\n   - The opponent might think the same way and choose scissors\n   - To counter scissors, I should choose rock\n   - Rock also covers the possibility they switch to scissors thinking I'll repeat paper\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, which is what they might logically choose after our paper tie.\n\n[move] rock",

Identify the crucial shift:\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern and chose scissors\n   - This was exactly what I feared - they adapted to counter my successful paper strategy\n   - They've now used scissors in rounds 8 and 10, showing increased variety\n   - My over-reliance on predicting rock backfired\n\n4.

Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: rock\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n\n3. Identify the surprising choice:\n   - They chose paper, not rock as I expected\n   - This resulted in a tie since I also chose paper\n   - Paper is now tied with rock as their most frequent choice\n   - My prediction was wrong but led to a neutral outcome\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 18)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17)\n   - Paper and rock are now tied as their most frequent choices\n\n5. Consider what this reveals:\n   - They didn't return to rock after scissors failed\n   - Instead they chose paper, showing continued unpredictability\n   - The tie might be coincidental or they might be thinking similarly to me\n   - Their choice patterns are becoming harder to predict\n\n6. Evaluate tie psychology:\n   - This is our third tie in the game (rounds 1, 4, 8, 18)\n   - Previous ties were: paper-paper, rock-rock, scissors-scissors, now paper-paper again\n   - After ties, players often either repeat the move or choose what would have won\n   - Scissors would have beaten our paper tie\n\n7. Consider their likely response:\n   - They might stick with paper since it just avoided a loss\n   - They might choose scissors (what would have won against paper)\n   - They might switch to rock (their other most frequent choice)\n   - Given tie psychology, scissors seems plausible as the \"winning\" response\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they choose scissors (logical response to paper tie), I should choose rock\n   - If they stick with paper (avoiding change after tie), I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to rock (alternating between favorites), I should choose paper\n   - The psychological tendency after ties is often to choose what would have won\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, expecting them to choose what would have won our paper tie.\n\n[move] (After our paper tie they might choose scissors which would have won) rock",

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (win, +1 point)\n   - Current score: +5 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: rock\n   - Round 5: paper\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock\n   - Round 8: scissors\n   - Round 9: rock\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: rock\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: paper\n   - Round 19: scissors\n\n3. Identify the pattern confirmation:\n   - They chose scissors exactly as I predicted after our paper tie\n   - This confirms the psychological tendency to choose what would have won after ties\n   - My understanding of their tie psychology was accurate\n   - They're following predictable post-tie behavior\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 18)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19)\n   - All three moves are now perfectly balanced at 7 each\n\n5. Consider their recent pattern:\n   - Last 4 rounds: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now used scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - This suggests a return to scissors preference after the paper tie\n   - They might be falling back into a scissors-heavy pattern\n\n6. Evaluate their likely psychology:\n   - They just lost with scissors again\n   - This is their second consecutive scissors loss (rounds 17 and 19)\n   - Following their pattern, they might abandon scissors temporarily\n   - Or they might try scissors once more before switching\n\n7. Consider their switching behavior:\n   - They typically try successful moves 2-3 times before abandoning them\n   - Scissors worked in round 16, failed in round 17, then they used paper in round 18, then failed with scissors again in round 19\n   - They might now switch to rock or paper\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they abandon scissors and choose rock, I should choose paper\n   - If they abandon scissors and choose paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they persist with scissors (unlikely after two losses), I should choose rock\n   - Given their balanced distribution and tendency to switch after losses, rock or paper seem most likely\n\n9. Final assessment:\n   - Rock and paper are tied as alternatives to their recently failed scissors\n   - Rock has been their historically strong choice\n   - After multiple scissors failures, rock seems like their logical fallback\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to switch to rock after their recent scissors failures.\n\n[move] (After multiple scissors losses they might return to rock) paper",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate psychological factors after tie:\n   - This is our second tie (first was round 1 with paper, now round 8 with scissors)\n   - After ties, players often either stick with the same move or switch to what would have won\n   - Rock would have beaten our scissors tie\n   - They might expect me to think the same way\n\n7.

Make strategic decision:\n   - If they choose rock (logical after scissors tie), I should choose paper\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock\n   - If they return to paper, I should choose scissors\n   - Rock seems most likely as the \"winning\" response to our scissors tie\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to choose what would have won the previous round.\n\n[move] paper",

Identify strong patterns emerging:\n   - Rock has now appeared 4 times in the last 6 rounds (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - They seem to be gravitating toward rock more frequently\n   - After trying scissors in round 8, they returned to rock in round 9\n   - My prediction was correct again - they chose rock after the scissors tie\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9) - now their most frequent choice\n   - Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 8)\n   - Rock has become their dominant strategy\n\n5. Consider psychological factors:\n   - I'm now winning 5-1 with 3 ties\n   - They're significantly behind and might be getting frustrated\n   - Rock might feel like the \"strongest\" choice psychologically\n   - They keep returning to rock despite it failing against my paper\n\n6. Evaluate their mindset:\n   - They just lost with rock again (3rd loss with rock)\n   - They might finally abandon rock after multiple failures\n   - Or they might stubbornly stick with it\n   - Given the pattern, they seem drawn to rock despite poor results\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they abandon rock after repeated failures, they might try paper or scissors\n   - If they stick with rock (showing persistence/stubbornness), I should choose paper again\n   - They might try to counter my successful paper with scissors\n   - But their recent behavior suggests they favor rock heavily\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - Their strong bias toward rock suggests they might try it again\n   - Even though it's failed multiple times, they keep returning to it\n   - If they choose rock again, paper wins\n   - If they finally switch to scissors (to beat my paper), I should choose rock\n   - Given their demonstrated rock preference, I'll bet on rock again\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper again to beat rock, expecting them to continue their rock-heavy strategy despite repeated failures.\n\n[move] paper",

Identify the crucial shift:\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern and chose scissors\n   - This was exactly what I feared - they adapted to counter my successful paper strategy\n   - They've now used scissors in rounds 8 and 10, showing increased variety\n   - My over-reliance on predicting rock backfired\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 5)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 8, 10)\n   - They're becoming more balanced in their choices\n\n5. Consider what this adaptation reveals:\n   - They're learning from my successful paper plays\n   - They correctly identified that I was expecting rock\n   - They're becoming more strategic and less predictable\n   - The \"fresh player\" is evolving during our game\n\n6. Evaluate the recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 8-10: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They might be alternating between scissors and rock now\n   - Or this could be coincidental\n   - But it shows they're moving away from pure rock dominance\n\n7. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they continue the scissors/rock alternation, next would be rock\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - They could return to paper (haven't used it since round 5)\n   - Given they just succeeded with scissors, they might repeat it or expect me to counter with rock\n\n8.

Make strategic decision:\n   - Rock just won for them, and they have a tendency to repeat what works\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper, but could stick with rock anyway\n   - Rock is now tied as their most frequent choice\n   - If they choose rock again, paper beats it\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to repeat their successful move from the previous round.\n\n[move] (Rock just worked for them and they tend to repeat successes) paper",

Consider psychological factors:\n   - They've now lost multiple times with scissors recently\n   - This might discourage further scissors usage\n   - Or they might stick with it since it's part of their recent pattern\n   - The perfect 7-7-7 distribution might influence their thinking\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with scissors (persistence pattern), I should choose rock again\n   - If they switch to paper (returning to a frequent choice), I should choose scissors\n   - If they choose rock (balancing their recent scissors heavy usage), I should choose paper\n   - Given their recent scissors losses, they might finally abandon it and try something else\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat paper, expecting them to switch away from scissors after multiple recent losses and return to paper as a safer choice.\n\n[move] (They might abandon scissors after recent losses and return to paper) scissors",

Identify the pattern confirmation:\n   - They chose scissors exactly as I predicted after our paper tie\n   - This confirms the psychological tendency to choose what would have won after ties\n   - My understanding of their tie psychology was accurate\n   - They're following predictable post-tie behavior\n\n4. Analyze current move distribution:\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 18)\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19)\n   - All three moves are now perfectly balanced at 7 each\n\n5. Consider their behavioral patterns:\n   - They still show predictable responses in certain situations (like after ties)\n   - The distribution shows they're not heavily biased toward any single move anymore\n   - They continue to repeat successful moves but also respond to situational psychology\n   - Their strategy has evolved but retains some predictable elements\n\n6. Evaluate their likely response:\n   - They just lost with scissors after I correctly predicted their post-tie behavior\n   - Following their pattern, they might abandon scissors temporarily\n   - With perfect distribution, any move is equally likely statistically\n   - But their psychology suggests moving away from recently failed choices\n\n7. Consider recent patterns:\n   - Last 3 rounds: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?\n   - They might continue the cycle with rock\n   - Or they might return to paper (avoiding recently failed scissors)\n   - Or they might choose rock (completing a potential cycle)\n\n8. Make strategic decision:\n   - If they choose rock (completing paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle), I should choose paper\n   - If they return to paper (avoiding failed scissors), I should choose scissors\n   - If they stick with scissors (rare but possible), I should choose rock\n   - Given their tendency to avoid recently failed moves and the potential cycle completion, rock seems most likely\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, expecting them to complete a potential cycle or move away from their failed scissors choice.\n\n[move] (They might complete a cycle with rock or avoid their failed scissors) paper",
