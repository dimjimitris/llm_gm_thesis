Analyze my opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: paper, scissors, rock\n   - They went back to rock after losing with scissors\n   - Rock has been their most frequent choice overall\n   - They seem to revert to rock when other strategies fail\n\n3. Notice a concerning trend:\n   - I keep trying to predict their next move and often guess wrong\n   - When I overthink, I tend to lose\n   - My wins came when I made simpler, more direct choices\n\n4. Reassess my strategy:\n   - My opponent appears to have rock as their default/comfort choice\n   - They experiment with other moves but return to rock\n   - Instead of trying to predict complex patterns, I should focus on countering their apparent rock preference\n\n5. Make a straightforward decision:\n   - Given their tendency to choose rock (especially after losses or uncertainty), I'll choose paper\n   - This is the direct counter to their most frequent choice\n   - Simple and effective rather than overthinking\n\n[move] (Going back to basics - paper beats rock, and they seem to favor rock as their default choice) paper"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
