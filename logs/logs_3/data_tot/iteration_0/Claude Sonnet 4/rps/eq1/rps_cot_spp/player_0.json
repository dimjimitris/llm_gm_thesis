    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since I have no information about opponent patterns, each move theoretically has equal probability\n   - In true random play, all moves have 33.33% chance\n   - However, humans often have biases - rock is commonly chosen first by beginners\n   - Many new players default to rock as it feels \"strong\"\n\n4. Choose my move:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock (common beginner choice), I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points\n   - This seems like the optimal choice against a fresh/new player\n\n[move] paper"

Update my understanding of the opponent:\n   - They are not a typical \"beginner\" who defaults to rock\n   - They chose paper, same as me\n   - This could mean:\n     a) They had similar reasoning (expecting me to play rock)\n     b) They have some strategy or pattern\n     c) It was random coincidence\n\n3.

Develop strategy for this round:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch from paper, they might choose scissors to beat my potential rock\n   - If opponent switches from their paper, they might go to rock or scissors\n   - If they go to rock (thinking I'll stay with paper), I should stick with paper\n   - If they go to scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock), I should choose rock\n\n5.

Review the game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Pattern: We've been matching each other's moves\n\n2. Analyze the opponent's behavior:\n   - They've now matched my moves twice in a row\n   - This could indicate:\n     a) They're using similar strategic thinking as me\n     b) They're trying to mirror my moves intentionally\n     c) Pure coincidence (unlikely after 2 rounds)\n     d) They're second-guessing what I'll do and arriving at same conclusions\n\n3. Consider the sequence pattern:\n   - We went paper \u2192 rock\n   - If following rock-paper-scissors cycle, scissors would be next\n   - But this might be too obvious\n\n4. Think about opponent's next move prediction:\n   - If they expect me to continue the cycle (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they might play scissors too\n   - If they think I'll break the pattern, they might choose something to beat what they think I'll switch to\n   - If they're truly mirroring my strategy, they'll think similarly to me\n\n5. Develop counter-strategy:\n   - Since we've tied twice, I need to break this pattern\n   - If opponent expects scissors (continuing the cycle), I should play rock to beat scissors\n   - If opponent tries to counter-predict and goes with rock (thinking I'll avoid scissors), then I should play paper\n   - Given the mirroring behavior, I'll assume they're thinking similarly and might avoid the obvious scissors\n\n6. Final decision:\n   - I'll choose scissors - completing the cycle but also potentially breaking the mirroring pattern\n   - If they mirror again, it's another tie, but if they try to counter-predict, scissors might catch them off guard\n\n[move] scissors"

Marvel at the opponent's incredible predictability:\n   - 5 consecutive rounds of perfect prediction on my part\n   - They are 100% locked into the pattern: \"counter what they think I'll repeat\"\n   - After each of my wins, they play the move that beats my winning move\n   - They haven't deviated even once despite losing 5 straight rounds\n\n3. Analyze the psychological lock-in:\n   - The opponent is now in a 5-round losing streak\n   - Yet they continue the exact same failed strategy\n   - This suggests either: a) extreme stubbornness, b) inability to recognize patterns, or c) panic-induced repetition\n   - Under pressure, people often double-down on familiar strategies even when failing\n\n4. Predict Round 10 with high confidence:\n   - I just won with paper, beating their rock\n   - Their pattern dictates they'll expect me to repeat paper\n   - They should play scissors to beat my expected paper\n   - This pattern has been flawless for 5 consecutive rounds\n\n5. Consider the slim possibility of change:\n   - After 5 straight losses, they might finally break pattern\n   - But psychological research shows people rarely change under pressure\n   - The pattern is so ingrained now, breaking it would require conscious recognition of their error\n   - Most likely they'll continue the same approach\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Following their established pattern: they'll play scissors (to beat expected paper)\n   - I should play rock to beat their expected scissors\n   - This would give me an incredible 6th consecutive win\n   - Given their perfect consistency, this is almost guaranteed\n\n[move] rock"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-4: Mixed results, ending at -2 points\n   - Rounds 5-9: I won 5 straight using counter-prediction (+3 points total)\n   - Round 10: Me=rock, Opponent=paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: +2 points\n\n2. Analyze the critical pattern break:\n   - For 5 rounds, opponent played the move that beats my previous winning move\n   - In Round 10, I expected them to play scissors (to beat my previous paper)\n   - Instead they played paper, which broke their established pattern\n   - This suggests they finally recognized and adapted to my strategy\n\n3. Consider what changed their approach:\n   - After 5 consecutive losses, they finally broke their predictable pattern\n   - They may have realized I was counter-predicting their counter-predictions\n   - Playing paper instead of scissors suggests they expected me to expect scissors\n   - They successfully out-meta-gamed me this round\n\n4. Evaluate the new strategic landscape:\n   - The opponent has shown they can adapt and break patterns\n   - They're no longer predictably countering my previous moves\n   - I can't rely on the same counter-prediction strategy anymore\n   - They might now be trying to predict my predictions of their predictions\n\n5. Predict their thinking for Round 11:\n   - They just successfully broke their pattern and won\n   - They might expect me to be confused or try to re-establish the old pattern\n   - They could think I'll try to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Or they might expect me to think they'll return to their old pattern\n\n6. Develop new strategy:\n   - The meta-game has evolved - they're now adapting\n   - I should avoid overthinking and perhaps make a more straightforward choice\n   - Since they played paper last round, a simple approach might be to play scissors\n   - Or I could try to out-think their new adaptive strategy\n\nGiven the complexity and their demonstrated ability to adapt, I'll go with a direct approach:\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the opponent's new strategy:\n   - Round 10: They played paper (breaking their counter-my-previous-move pattern)\n   - Round 11: They played rock (beats my scissors)\n   - They seem to have completely abandoned their predictable approach\n   - They're now 2-0 since changing strategies\n\n3. Identify the new pattern possibilities:\n   - Round 10: paper, Round 11: rock\n   - If following rock-paper-scissors sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors would be next\n   - Or they might be randomly selecting moves now\n   - Or they're trying to counter-predict my new attempts to read them\n\n4.

Evaluate my options for Round 12:\n   - If they continue rock-paper sequence: scissors would be next, so I should play rock\n   - If they're now playing randomly: any move has equal chance\n   - If they expect me to try counter-predicting again: they might be setting a trap\n   - If they think I'll try to beat their rock with paper: they might play scissors\n\n6.

Predict Round 19 in the unbroken sequence:\n   - The cycle: paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper...\n   - Round 10: paper\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors  \n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: paper\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: should be paper (restarting the cycle for the 3rd time)\n\n4. Analyze this remarkable phenomenon:\n   - They've now lost 7 straight rounds - an extraordinary streak\n   - Yet they maintain perfect adherence to the sequential pattern\n   - This suggests complete psychological commitment or total pattern blindness\n   - The cycle has become so automatic they may not even realize they're doing it\n\n5. Consider the statistical miracle:\n   - 9 consecutive rounds of perfect sequence prediction\n   - 7 straight wins using pure pattern recognition\n   - This level of predictability is almost impossible in competitive play\n   - Yet they continue with unwavering consistency\n\n6. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Following their 9-round perfect cycle, they should play paper (cycle restart)\n   - I should play scissors to beat their expected paper\n   - This would give me an incredible 8 straight wins\n   - Given their absolute mechanical consistency, this is virtually guaranteed\n\n[move] scissors"
