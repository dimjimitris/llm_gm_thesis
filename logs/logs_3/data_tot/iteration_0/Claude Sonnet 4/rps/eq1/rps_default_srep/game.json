  "player_0_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the recent pattern: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n\nIt appears they might be alternating between paper streaks and scissors breaks. Overall statistics:\n- Scissors: 8 times (most frequent)\n- Paper: 4 times \n- Rock: 3 times\n\nScissors remains their most used move overall, and they just used it after a paper streak. Given their tendency to play moves in short streaks, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors (their favorite move)\n2. Go back to paper (their recent preference)\n3. Try rock (least used recently)\n\nSince they have a historical preference for scissors and just used it, and considering they sometimes play scissors in streaks, I'll choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n[move] rock",
