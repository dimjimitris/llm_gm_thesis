Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no prior information about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop a strategy for the first move:\n   - Since I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors all have the same mathematical expectation against a random opponent\n   - However, in psychology studies, rock is often the most common first move for new players\n   - If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Given that fresh/new players often default to rock as their first move, paper gives me the best chance to win this round\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze their possible next move:\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock (which worked 3 times), they might play paper again\n   - If they think I'll adapt to their paper, they might switch back to scissors\n   - They could be starting a new pattern or just making one-off adjustments\n   - Rock remains completely unused by them\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper, I should play scissors\n   - If they return to scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they finally try rock, we tie\n   - I need to decide which is most likely\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - They just successfully countered my strategy with paper\n   - They might try paper again since it worked\n   - But they also showed strong commitment to scissors historically\n   - Given they just broke a long pattern, they might experiment more\n   - I'll counter their potential continued paper play with scissors\n\n[move] Scissors"

Recognize the new pattern development:\n   - After 6 consecutive scissors (rounds 4-9), they switched to paper\n   - They've now played paper in rounds 10 and 11\n   - This could be a new streak developing, similar to their scissors streak\n   - They still have never played rock in 11 rounds\n\n4. Evaluate what just happened:\n   - I correctly predicted they would continue with paper after their successful counter\n   - My scissors beat their paper perfectly\n   - This brings me back to +2 points\n   - I successfully adapted when their strategy changed\n\n5. Consider their likely response:\n   - They might continue with paper since they had success with it in round 10\n   - They might switch back to scissors (their historically preferred move)\n   - They could be testing if I've figured out their new paper preference\n   - Given their tendency toward streaks, continuing with paper seems likely\n\n6. Analyze the psychological aspect:\n   - They showed they can adapt (scissors to paper after losing streak)\n   - But they also showed they tend to stick with moves in streaks\n   - Paper worked once for them, lost once - they might try it again\n   - Their historical pattern suggests commitment to chosen moves\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - They've played paper twice in a row after their long scissors streak\n   - If they're developing a new paper preference (like they had with scissors), scissors counters it perfectly\n   - Even if they switch back to scissors, I have a 50/50 chance\n   - Given their pattern of streaks, continuing to counter their potential paper streak makes sense\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze my opponent's extraordinary streak:\n   - Rounds 4-9: 6 consecutive scissors\n   - Rounds 10-15: 6 consecutive papers\n   - They've now matched their scissors streak with an equal paper streak\n   - They still have never played rock in 15 rounds\n\n3.

Consider the remaining pattern:\n   - If they maintain their 6-round commitment, 2 more rocks are coming\n   - They've never broken a streak once committed\n   - Their behavior shows zero adaptation despite repeated losses\n   - The mathematical probability of continued rock play is extremely high\n\n6. Analyze the strategic certainty:\n   - They've lost 3 rounds in a row with rock but haven't switched\n   - This matches their previous behavior of losing multiple rounds without changing\n   - Their commitment to 6-round streaks appears absolute\n   - Paper remains the perfect counter with near-certainty\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - The pattern is so mathematically precise that deviation would be irrational\n   - They're at 4/6 rocks in their cycle, with 2 more highly probable\n   - My paper strategy is working flawlessly\n   - I should continue exploiting their completely predictable behavior\n\n[move] Paper"

Consider their possible next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors (returning to their historically preferred move)\n   - They might switch to rock (continuing to mix things up)\n   - They might try paper (completing a quick cycle)\n   - The pattern is now less clear than before\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play paper\n   - If they try paper, I should play scissors\n   - Scissors seems most likely given their historical preference and recent switch\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - They just successfully countered my paper with scissors\n   - Scissors was their most frequently played move historically (7 times in first 15 rounds)\n   - They might be returning to their comfort zone after experimenting with rock\n   - I should play rock to counter their likely continued scissors play\n\n[move] Rock"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Develop a strategy for the first move:\n   - Since I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors all have the same mathematical expectation against a random opponent\n   - However, in psychology studies, rock is often the most common first move for new players\n   - If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4.

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n4. Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns - many beginners tend to throw rock first as it's the most intuitive \"strong\" move.\n5. If my opponent is likely to throw rock, I should throw paper to beat it and gain +1 point.\n6. Even if I'm wrong, the worst case is I lose 1 point, but the potential gain justifies this strategy against a beginner.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the common beginner tendency to start with rock.\n\n[move] paper",

In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move when playing randomly, as each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n5. However, against new/fresh players, there are some common tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with \"rock\" as it's often the first move people think of\n   - Some players go with \"scissors\" thinking it's aggressive\n   - \"Paper\" is sometimes considered less obvious\n6.

Analyze their possible next move:\n   - If they're truly random now, any move is equally likely\n   - If they're avoiding rock (which they haven't used), it's paper or scissors\n   - If they think I expect them to continue with scissors, they might switch\n   - Rock is still the \"unused\" move that might surprise me\n\n6. Consider my strategic approach:\n   - I'm tied at 0 points, so I need to start winning rounds\n   - The fact that they broke their pattern suggests they're actively thinking about my predictions\n   - Rock remains their unused move and might be their next choice to surprise me\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - Given they haven't used rock in 5 rounds and just broke their pattern\n   - Rock seems like a reasonable prediction for someone trying to be unpredictable\n   - To beat rock, I should choose paper\n\n[move] Paper",

Confirm the pattern recognition:\n   - My opponent has a very strong preference for scissors\n   - They've only played paper twice (rounds 1 and 3) and never played rock\n   - The scissors dominance is even stronger than I initially realized\n   - Rock has been successful against them both times I used it (rounds 2 and 7)\n\n4. Consider their possible reaction:\n   - They just lost with scissors after winning with it multiple times\n   - They might stick with scissors since it's been their most successful move overall\n   - They might finally switch to rock (their unused move) to surprise me\n   - They might switch to paper to beat my successful rock strategy\n\n5. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - I just won by playing rock against their scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock again since it worked\n   - If they expect rock, they might finally play paper\n   - But their historical strong preference for scissors might override this logic\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with scissors (most likely based on history), rock wins again\n   - If they switch to paper (countering my rock), scissors would win\n   - If they finally use rock (their unused move), paper would win\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - Their overwhelming preference for scissors (5 out of 7 rounds) suggests they're likely to stick with it\n   - Even though they just lost with scissors, their pattern shows strong commitment to this move\n   - Playing rock again gives me the best chance based on their demonstrated behavior\n   - I'll continue exploiting their scissors preference\n\n[move] Rock",

Evaluate my current strategy:\n   - My scissors strategy is perfectly countering their paper streak\n   - I've won 2 rounds in a row by playing scissors against their paper\n   - I'm now at +3 points, my highest score yet\n   - My adaptation to their strategy change is working perfectly\n\n5. Consider their psychology and tendencies:\n   - They showed extreme commitment to scissors (6 straight rounds)\n   - Now they're showing similar commitment to paper (3 straight rounds)\n   - They tend to stick with strategies in long streaks rather than switching frequently\n   - Their pattern suggests they might continue with paper\n\n6. Assess the risks:\n   - If they continue with paper, scissors wins again\n   - If they switch back to scissors, scissors ties\n   - If they finally try rock (still unused), rock beats my scissors\n   - But their historical pattern strongly suggests continuing their current streak\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - The evidence strongly suggests they're in a \"paper phase\" like they were in a \"scissors phase\"\n   - They've shown a tendency toward long streaks rather than frequent switching\n   - My scissors strategy is working perfectly against their paper preference\n   - I should continue with what's been consistently successful\n\n[move] Scissors",

Review the recent developments:\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 21: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 22: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 23: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Current total score: +10 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Rounds 4-9: 6 consecutive scissors\n   - Rounds 10-15: 6 consecutive papers\n   - Rounds 16-19: 4 consecutive rocks\n   - Rounds 20-23: 4 consecutive scissors\n   - They're now deep into another scissors streak after their rock experiment\n\n3. Recognize the extraordinary pattern:\n   - My opponent has now played scissors 4 times in a row\n   - They've lost 3 consecutive rounds but refuse to change from scissors\n   - This perfectly mirrors their previous scissors streak behavior (rounds 4-9)\n   - Their commitment to scissors despite losses is remarkable\n\n4. Evaluate my commanding position:\n   - I'm now at +10 points, a massive and dominant lead\n   - My rock strategy has won 3 consecutive rounds against their scissors streak\n   - I've reached double-digit points for the first time\n   - My pattern recognition and counter-strategies are working flawlessly\n\n5. Consider their psychological commitment:\n   - They've returned to their most comfortable and historically preferred move\n   - They're showing the same stubborn commitment that characterized their previous streaks\n   - They lost 3 rounds with scissors in their first streak before continuing\n   - This suggests they may continue with scissors despite current losses\n\n6. Analyze the mathematical probability:\n   - Their first scissors streak lasted 6 rounds\n   - They're currently at 4/6 in what appears to be a second scissors streak\n   - Rock has a perfect record against their scissors throughout the entire game\n   - The evidence overwhelmingly supports continued scissors play\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Their behavior is incredibly consistent with their previous scissors streak patterns\n   - They're showing the same commitment despite losing streaks\n   - Rock continues to be the perfect counter to their scissors obsession\n   - I should maintain this winning strategy that's building my commanding lead\n\n[move] Rock",
