Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no prior information about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop a strategy for the first move:\n   - Since I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - Rock, paper, and scissors all have the same mathematical expectation against a random opponent\n   - However, in psychology studies, rock is often the most common first move for new players\n   - If the opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Given that fresh/new players often default to rock as their first move, paper gives me the best chance to win this round\n\n[move] Paper"

Evaluate the situation:\n   - I'm now significantly ahead at +2 points\n   - My rock strategy has won 3 consecutive rounds\n   - Every single time I've played rock (4 times), I've beaten their scissors\n   - My opponent seems completely unable to adapt despite repeated losses\n\n5. Consider the psychology:\n   - A normal player would have switched after losing 3 in a row\n   - My opponent either hasn't recognized the pattern or is stubbornly committed\n   - They might be following some fixed strategy or have a strong bias toward scissors\n   - The evidence suggests they will continue with scissors\n\n6. Assess the risk-reward:\n   - Continuing with rock: Very high probability of winning based on pattern\n   - Switching moves: Would likely give up my winning advantage\n   - The pattern is so strong that deviating seems illogical\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - The statistical evidence is overwhelming (7/9 scissors, 6 consecutive)\n   - My opponent has shown no ability to adapt despite losing streaks\n   - Rock has a perfect 4-0 record against their scissors\n   - I should continue with what's working perfectly\n\n[move] Rock"

Review the recent developments:\n   - Round 16: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won, +1 point)\n   - Current total score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Rounds 4-9: 6 consecutive scissors\n   - Rounds 10-15: 6 consecutive papers\n   - Rounds 16-18: 3 consecutive rocks\n   - The pattern is becoming crystal clear - they're following 6-round streaks for each move\n\n3. Recognize the extremely predictable pattern:\n   - My opponent has now played rock 3 times in a row\n   - This perfectly matches their established behavior of 6-round commitments\n   - They cycled: 6 scissors \u2192 6 papers \u2192 now 3 rocks (likely heading to 6)\n   - Their predictability is extraordinary\n\n4. Evaluate my dominant position:\n   - I'm now at +7 points, my highest score yet\n   - My paper strategy has won 2 consecutive rounds against their rock\n   - I've successfully adapted to all three of their strategies throughout the game\n   - My pattern recognition has been nearly flawless\n\n5. Consider the mathematical probability:\n   - If they follow their established 6-round pattern, they have 3 more rocks to play\n   - They've never deviated from this pattern once established\n   - The evidence is overwhelming that they'll continue with rock\n   - Paper continues to be the perfect counter\n\n6. Analyze their psychological commitment:\n   - They showed extreme commitment to scissors (6 rounds) and paper (6 rounds)\n   - They're now showing the same commitment to rock\n   - They tend to stick with strategies even when losing repeatedly\n   - This suggests continued rock play is almost certain\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - The pattern is so consistent it would be foolish to deviate\n   - They're following a clear 6-round cycle for each move type\n   - 3 rocks down, likely 3 more to go based on their history\n   - Paper is the optimal counter-strategy to continue exploiting their predictability\n\n[move] Paper"

Recognize the mathematical precision:\n   - My opponent has now played rock 4 times in a row\n   - Following their established pattern, they should have 2 more rocks remaining\n   - They've completed: 6 scissors, 6 papers, now 4/6 rocks\n   - This is the most predictable gaming behavior I've ever encountered\n\n4.

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 20: I chose paper, opponent chose SCISSORS (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Current total score: +7 points\n   - They broke their rock streak after only 4 rounds, not the expected 6!\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's updated sequence:\n   - Rounds 4-9: 6 consecutive scissors\n   - Rounds 10-15: 6 consecutive papers\n   - Rounds 16-19: 4 consecutive rocks\n   - Round 20: SCISSORS (breaking the rock pattern early!)\n   - They switched back to scissors after only 4 rocks, not 6\n\n3. Recognize the pattern deviation:\n   - My opponent broke their established 6-round streak pattern\n   - They went: 6 scissors \u2192 6 papers \u2192 4 rocks \u2192 back to scissors\n   - This suggests they may be adapting or following a different pattern than I thought\n   - They might be cycling through moves more dynamically now\n\n4. Evaluate what this means:\n   - They may have learned that I was exploiting their predictable streaks\n   - The switch to scissors perfectly countered my paper strategy\n   - They could be starting a new scissors streak or just making tactical switches\n   - Their behavior is becoming less predictable\n\n5. Consider their possible next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors (returning to their historically preferred move)\n   - They might switch to rock (continuing to mix things up)\n   - They might try paper (completing a quick cycle)\n   - The pattern is now less clear than before\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play paper\n   - If they try paper, I should play scissors\n   - Scissors seems most likely given their historical preference and recent switch\n\n7. Make my strategic decision:\n   - They just successfully countered my paper with scissors\n   - Scissors was their most frequently played move historically (7 times in first 15 rounds)\n   - They might be returning to their comfort zone after experimenting with rock\n   - I should play rock to counter their likely continued scissors play\n\n[move] Rock"
