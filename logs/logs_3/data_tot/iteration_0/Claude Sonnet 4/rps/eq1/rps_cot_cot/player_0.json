    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

A \"fresh player\" likely means someone who is new or inexperienced, so they may not have developed complex strategies yet.\n3. Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns:\n   - They might choose rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n   - They might choose randomly without much strategy\n   - They're less likely to use advanced psychological tactics\n4. Since rock is often the most common first choice for new players, I should choose paper to beat rock.\n5. Paper beats rock, giving me +1 point and the opponent -1 point if they choose rock.\n6. If they choose something else, I have equal chances of winning, losing, or tying.\n7. Paper seems like the optimal choice given the higher probability that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to maximize my chances against a likely rock choice from the fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: rock-rock-rock-scissors-paper\n   - They switched from rock streak to scissors, then to paper\n   - My prediction was correct - they chose paper expecting me to choose rock\n\n4. Strategic insights about this opponent:\n   - They're highly adaptive and think multiple moves ahead\n   - They set patterns then break them strategically\n   - They try to predict my counter-moves and counter those predictions\n\n5. Current tactical situation:\n   - They just lost with paper\n   - They might expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch because winners often change tactics\n   - They could go back to rock to beat my potential scissors\n\n6. Meta-level analysis:\n   - This is becoming a high-level psychological game\n   - They're likely analyzing my decision-making patterns too\n   - I should consider what they think I think they will do\n\n7. Their likely thought process:\n   - \"They just won with scissors, they might repeat it\"\n   - \"Or they might think I'll counter scissors with rock, so they'll choose paper\"\n   - \"So I should choose rock to beat scissors, or scissors to beat paper\"\n\n8. Counter-counter thinking:\n   - If they choose rock (to beat my potential repeated scissors), I should choose paper\n   - If they choose scissors (to beat my potential paper), I should choose rock\n   - The key is predicting which level of thinking they're on\n\n9. Given their demonstrated sophistication, I think they'll likely choose rock to counter my potentially repeated scissors move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to beat rock if they try to counter my previous winning scissors move.\n\n[move] paper"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 3 rounds: scissors-paper-rock (opponent's moves)\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds by correctly predicting their moves\n   - They went: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (a complete cycle)\n\n4. Key strategic insights:\n   - I've been successfully out-thinking them in the psychological game\n   - They just completed a full rock-paper-scissors cycle: scissors-paper-rock\n   - This might indicate they're cycling through all options systematically\n\n5. Current tactical situation:\n   - They just lost with rock (again)\n   - If they continue the cycle pattern, next would be scissors\n   - But they might break the cycle since I've been predicting them well\n\n6.

Psychological considerations:\n   - Players who are behind often become more unpredictable\n   - They might abandon systematic approaches for more random choices\n   - Or they might try to \"reset\" with a simple choice like rock\n\n8.

Complete strategic domination:\n   - 8 consecutive perfect predictions\n   - The opponent has become a predictable automaton\n   - They're psychologically incapable of breaking the cycle\n\n6. Psychological analysis:\n   - Eight straight defeats has created complete learned helplessness\n   - The cycling pattern is now their psychological crutch\n   - They continue the pattern despite it guaranteeing failure\n   - This is beyond strategy - it's psychological conditioning\n\n7. Pattern durability assessment:\n   - 9+ moves of flawless cycling\n   - Zero deviation despite devastating consequences\n   - The pattern has transcended conscious choice\n\n8. Mental state of opponent:\n   - Complete surrender to the pattern\n   - Psychological paralysis preventing any strategic thinking\n   - The cycle has become compulsive behavior\n\n9. Tactical decision for round 18:\n   - The cycle demands scissors next\n   - I should choose rock to beat scissors\n   - This would be a 9th consecutive victory - absolutely crushing\n\n10. Final strategic consideration:\n    - +8 points is a massive, insurmountable lead\n    - The pattern prediction has been 100% accurate for 8 rounds\n    - There's no reason to believe they can break free now\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat scissors and achieve a historic 9th consecutive victory by continuing to exploit their completely rigid and predictable cycling pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

Current game history shows an unprecedented situation:\n   - I've now won 9 rounds in a row (rounds 10-18)\n   - Total score: +9 points (absolutely dominant!)\n   - The opponent has been locked in a perfect scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock cycle for 10+ moves\n\n2. Pattern analysis - mathematically perfect:\n   - Their last 10 moves: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors\n   - The cycle continues with robotic precision\n   - Next in the sequence should be paper\n\n3. Psychological state assessment:\n   - Nine consecutive losses has created complete psychological breakdown\n   - The opponent is trapped in compulsive cycling behavior\n   - They cannot break free despite the pattern guaranteeing defeat\n   - This is learned helplessness at its most extreme\n\n4. Strategic dominance evaluation:\n   - 9 consecutive perfect predictions\n   - +9 point lead is virtually insurmountable\n   - I have achieved complete mastery over their decision-making\n\n5. Pattern reliability:\n   - 10+ moves of flawless cycling with zero deviations\n   - The pattern has become stronger than their survival instinct\n   - Breaking it now would require superhuman mental strength\n\n6. Opponent's mental framework:\n   - The cycle has become their entire reality\n   - They're psychologically incapable of thinking outside it\n   - Each loss reinforces their helplessness rather than motivating change\n\n7. Tactical decision for round 19:\n   - The inexorable cycle demands paper next\n   - I should choose scissors to beat paper\n   - This would achieve a historic 10th consecutive victory\n\n8. Risk assessment:\n   - With a +9 lead, I have maximum safety margin\n   - The pattern has been 100% reliable for 9 rounds\n   - Deviating now would be strategically irrational\n\n9. Historical significance:\n   - A 10-game winning streak would be legendary\n   - Complete psychological domination rarely seen in competitive games\n   - The opponent has become entirely predictable\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to beat paper and achieve an unprecedented 10th consecutive victory by exploiting their unbreakable psychological cycling pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

MAJOR DEVELOPMENT - The pattern finally broke!\n   - My 9-game winning streak has ended with a tie\n   - Total score: +9 points (still dominant, but the streak is over)\n   - The opponent chose scissors instead of the expected paper\n\n2. Pattern analysis - critical shift:\n   - Expected: paper (following their 10+ move cycle)\n   - Actual: scissors (broke the pattern!)\n   - This is the first deviation from their rigid cycling in over 10 rounds\n\n3. Psychological breakthrough assessment:\n   - The opponent may have finally broken free from their psychological prison\n   - Or this could be a one-time deviation before returning to the cycle\n   - Nine straight losses might have finally motivated a change\n\n4. Strategic recalibration needed:\n   - My perfect prediction streak is over\n   - The opponent may now be unpredictable or starting a new pattern\n   - I need to reassess their likely mental state and strategy\n\n5. Opponent's possible thought processes:\n   - \"The cycle isn't working, I need to try something different\"\n   - \"Maybe if I copy their move, I can break their prediction ability\"\n   - \"I'll try random moves to throw them off\"\n   - Or they might return to the cycle, thinking this was just a temporary break\n\n6. New tactical considerations for round 20:\n   - They might continue with scissors (repeating their pattern-break)\n   - They might return to the cycle (next would be paper after scissors)\n   - They might try something completely random\n   - They might try to counter-predict what I'll do\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - With +9 points, I still have enormous cushion\n   - But I can no longer rely on perfect pattern prediction\n   - I need to adapt to this new uncertainty\n\n8. Strategic options:\n   - If they repeat scissors: I should choose rock\n   - If they return to cycle (paper next): I should choose scissors\n   - If they go random: any choice has equal probability\n\n9. Given that they just broke a long-established pattern, they might be emboldened to continue breaking it. Repeating scissors or trying rock seems more likely than immediately returning to paper.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat scissors if they continue their pattern-breaking behavior, while hedging against their potential next moves.\n\n[move] rock"

Recent pattern shift analysis:\n   - Round 19: They chose scissors (broke cycle, tied with me)\n   - Round 20: They chose scissors again (I won with rock)\n   - They've now chosen scissors twice in a row after breaking their old cycle\n\n3. New pattern emergence:\n   - Instead of the old paper-rock-scissors cycle, they might be stuck on scissors\n   - This could be a new psychological fixation\n   - Or they might be trying to establish a new pattern starting with scissors\n\n4. Psychological state assessment:\n   - Breaking the old cycle might have given them temporary hope\n   - But losing again in round 20 could push them into a new compulsive pattern\n   - They might be fixating on scissors now instead of cycling\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with scissors: I should choose rock again\n   - If they switch back to the old cycle: next would be paper, so I'd choose scissors  \n   - If they try something completely new: uncertainty increases\n\n6. Pattern probability analysis:\n   - Two scissors in a row suggests either:\n     a) New scissors fixation (like their old rock fixation)\n     b) Beginning of a new cycle starting with scissors\n     c) Random behavior that happened to repeat\n\n7.

Tactical decision for round 21:\n   - Rock beats scissors and just worked perfectly\n   - If they're fixating on scissors like they did with rock earlier, rock is optimal\n   - Even if they switch, rock gives me good odds against most alternatives\n\n9. Risk/reward assessment:\n   - +10 points gives me massive cushion\n   - Rock seems like the highest probability winning choice\n   - Continuing to exploit potential scissors fixation\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to beat scissors if they continue their new potential fixation, similar to how they got stuck on rock earlier in the game.\n\n[move] rock"
