Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some might go with paper thinking others will choose rock\n   - Scissors is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for beginners, paper would beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning against a predictable opponent\n   - If they choose paper or scissors, I either tie or lose, but the probability favors rock from a fresh player\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper is my optimal choice to counter the most likely beginner move of rock\n\n[move] paper"

Key insight about adaptation:\n   - When I expect scissors and play rock, they often counter with paper\n   - We keep tying when we both choose scissors\n   - I need to break this cycle\n\n5.

Develop my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for beginners, paper would beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning against a predictable opponent\n   - If they choose paper or scissors, I either tie or lose, but the probability favors rock from a fresh player\n\n5.

Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has an equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, there are some psychological tendencies in first-time players:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's the most \"solid\" choice)\n   - Some go with scissors (it's the last option mentioned)\n   - Paper is often seen as the \"weakest\" choice mentally\n\n5. If I assume the opponent is slightly more likely to throw rock (common beginner tendency), then paper would be the optimal counter-move.\n\n6.

Consider a simpler strategy:\n   - Instead of overthinking their patterns, what if I focus on pure probabilities?\n   - Over the entire game, what are their true frequencies?\n   - Or should I try to be truly random to avoid being read?\n\n6. Decision logic for this critical moment:\n   - They just used paper and we tied\n   - If they repeat paper again, scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to rock (their other recent favorite), paper beats rock\n   - If they go to scissors (least used recently), rock beats scissors\n   - Given their heavy recent use of paper, I'll counter with scissors\n\n[move] scissors",
