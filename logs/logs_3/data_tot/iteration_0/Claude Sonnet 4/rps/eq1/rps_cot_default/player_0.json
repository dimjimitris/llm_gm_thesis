    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some might go with paper thinking others will choose rock\n   - Scissors is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for beginners, paper would beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning against a predictable opponent\n   - If they choose paper or scissors, I either tie or lose, but the probability favors rock from a fresh player\n\n5.

Pattern analysis of recent exchanges:\n   - They've been successfully countering most of my moves\n   - But this tie suggests either:\n     a) They didn't anticipate my rock, or\n     b) They're also thinking the same way I am\n\n4. Consider the tie psychology:\n   - We both chose rock after they played scissors\n   - This might indicate we're both thinking similarly about countering scissors\n   - Or they're trying to anticipate what I'd do after their scissors win\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - They just tied with rock\n   - Some players repeat after ties, others switch\n   - Given their adaptive nature, they might switch\n   - If they expect me to counter rock with paper, they might play scissors\n\n6. Decision approach:\n   - If they repeat rock, paper beats rock\n   - If they switch to paper (their historical favorite), scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (to counter my potential paper), rock beats scissors\n   - Given their tendency to adapt and their historical paper preference, I'll assume they switch to paper\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Another tie with scissors! My opponent switched from rock to scissors, same as me. I'm still down 8 points and these ties aren't helping me catch up.\n\nSteps for Round 23:\n\n1. Updated situation:\n   - Just tied with scissors vs their scissors (0)\n   - Current score: -8 + 0 = -8 points\n   - Still in a major deficit, need wins not ties\n\n2. Analyze recent tie pattern:\n   - Last two rounds were both ties: Rock-Rock, then Scissors-Scissors\n   - We're now thinking similarly or they're matching my moves intentionally\n   - This could indicate they're playing more defensively to preserve their lead\n\n3. Their recent sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've used all three moves in the last 3 rounds\n   - No clear pattern emerging in recent plays\n\n4. Consider tie psychology:\n   - Two ties in a row is unusual given their previous adaptive play\n   - They might be:\n     a) Trying to maintain their big lead with safe ties\n     b) Genuinely coincidentally thinking like me\n     c) Setting up for a pattern break\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - With such a large deficit, I need wins, not ties\n   - They just used scissors and tied\n   - If they expect me to counter scissors with rock, they might play paper\n   - If they repeat scissors, rock beats scissors\n   - If they switch to rock, paper beats rock\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - Given they just tied with scissors, they might stick with it (especially if playing defensively to preserve lead)\n   - Rock beats scissors and would give me a crucial win\n   - Even if wrong, I need to take risks to catch up at this point\n\n[move] rock"

Meta-analysis of their strategy:\n   - Even after two ties, they immediately went back to countering my rock with paper\n   - This confirms they're actively reading and countering my moves\n   - The ties might have been coincidental or tactical\n\n4. Recognition of my strategic failure:\n   - I keep falling into predictable patterns\n   - Every time I play rock (expecting scissors), they counter with paper\n   - I need to completely change my approach\n\n5. Desperate situation assessment:\n   - Down 9 points with limited rounds likely remaining\n   - I need multiple consecutive wins to have any chance\n   - Can't afford any more losses or even ties\n\n6. High-risk decision approach:\n   - They just played paper successfully against my rock\n   - If they expect me to counter paper with scissors, they might play rock\n   - If they stick with paper (their historical favorite), scissors beats paper\n   - Given their success with paper and tendency to use it, I'll risk scissors\n   - This is a must-win situation\n\n[move] scissors"
