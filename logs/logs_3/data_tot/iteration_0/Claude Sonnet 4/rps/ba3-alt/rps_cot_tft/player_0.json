    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new or without established patterns), I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\n4. Rock is the high-risk, high-reward option. If the opponent chooses randomly or tends to pick paper (a common first choice), rock could backfire badly.\n\n5. However, many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move because it seems \"strong\" or \"aggressive.\"\n\n6. If I assume the opponent might choose rock, then paper would be my best counter, giving me +3 points.\n\n7. Paper also beats scissors for +1 point, and only loses to rock.\n\n8. Given that this is against a fresh player who might gravitate toward rock, and paper gives me the maximum possible points when it wins, I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

I lost and got -1 points (the hint says I won with +1 points, but according to the rules, paper loses to scissors, so I think there might be an error in the hint - I'll assume I actually lost).\n\n2. Now I have information about my opponent's behavior: they chose scissors in round 1.\n\n3. I need to consider what they might do in round 2. Some possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might switch to counter what I played (rock to beat my paper)\n   - They might try rock as a \"stronger\" move\n   - They could go completely random\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Since they just succeeded with scissors against my paper, there's a reasonable chance they might try scissors again, or they might try to counter-counter by playing rock (thinking I'll adjust).\n\n6. Given the high reward for beating rock with paper (+3 points), and the fact that many players might switch to rock after winning with scissors, I think paper gives me the best risk-reward balance.\n\n7. Paper gives me maximum points if they choose rock, and only loses to scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost -1 points (the hint incorrectly said I won).\n\n2. Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost -3 points.\n\n3. Current pattern from opponent: scissors, then rock. This shows they're not sticking to one move.\n\n4. My current score appears to be -3 points (or -4 if round 1 was correctly scored).\n\n5. Now I need to predict their round 3 move. They've played scissors and rock, so they might:\n   - Complete the cycle with paper\n   - Go back to scissors (which worked in round 1)\n   - Stick with rock (which just worked well)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n6.

Since they just got a big win (+3) with rock, they might be tempted to play rock again. However, they might also think I'll adjust and play paper to counter rock, so they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n8. Given that I'm behind in points and need to catch up, and considering they might complete the pattern with paper, I'll choose scissors for the potential +1 point and to break any potential cycling pattern they might have.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Opponent's pattern so far: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   They played rock twice in a row, which suggests they might either:\n   - Continue with rock (sticking with what works)\n   - Switch away from rock (expecting me to counter with paper)\n   - Try paper to complete the cycle\n\n3.

Opponent's complete pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   This shows they've now used all three moves and aren't following a simple predictable cycle.\n\n3.

My current score: -1 + (-3) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + (-3) + 1 + (-1) = -5 points. Back to being significantly behind.\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - They just switched to paper after I played scissors twice\n   - This suggests they might be adapting to counter my scissors strategy\n   - Rock is still their most frequent choice (5/9 = 55.6%)\n   - Paper appeared in rounds 4 and 9 (both after I had some success)\n\n5. Adaptation analysis:\n   - When I played scissors successfully in round 8, they switched to paper in round 9\n   - This could be coincidence or strategic adaptation\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they go back to rock (their favorite), I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Given that they just played paper (possibly to counter my scissors pattern) and their historical rock preference, they might:\n   - Return to rock (their comfort zone)\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll stick with scissors\n   - Try scissors to complete a cycle\n\n8. Since I'm significantly behind (-5 points) and need to catch up, and considering their strong historical preference for rock, I think they're more likely to return to rock than continue with the paper adaptation. I'll play paper to get the maximum +3 points if they go back to rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Critical observations:\n   - They went back to rock after playing paper twice in a row\n   - Rock is back to being their most frequent choice at 8/17 rounds (47.1%)\n   - My scissors vs their rock record remains perfect: 6 wins, 0 losses\n   - Recent pattern: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They seem to cycle between phases: rock phase \u2192 paper phase \u2192 back to rock\n   - After experimenting with paper (rounds 15-16), they returned to rock\n   - This cycling behavior has happened multiple times\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - Rock remains their slight statistical favorite (47.1% vs 41.2% for paper)\n   - They just switched back to rock, suggesting they might continue with it\n   - Or they might quickly switch back to paper since they've been alternating\n   - My scissors continues to be 100% effective against their rock\n\n7. Recent cycling pattern:\n   - Rounds 12-17: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This shows alternating between 1-2 papers followed by 1 rock\n   - If the pattern holds, they might play paper next\n\n8. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played rock and have shown a tendency to not stick with one move for long\n   - However, rock is still their most common move overall\n   - My scissors has been incredibly effective against rock (6/6 success rate)\n   - Even though they might switch to paper to counter scissors, rock remains their go-to choice\n   - Given the cycling pattern and rock being their slight statistical favorite, I'll stick with scissors\n   - The risk-reward favors scissors since it has been my most successful strategy\n\n[move] Scissors"

Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played paper and likely expect me to play scissors again\n   - They might continue with paper or switch to scissors to counter expected scissors\n   - I'm far behind and need to be unpredictable\n   - Since they're expecting scissors, I should switch strategies\n   - Rock gives me a chance to beat scissors if they try to counter my expected scissors\n   - More importantly, it breaks my predictable pattern\n\n[move] Rock"
