First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new or without established patterns), I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\n4. Rock is the high-risk, high-reward option. If the opponent chooses randomly or tends to pick paper (a common first choice), rock could backfire badly.\n\n5. However, many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move because it seems \"strong\" or \"aggressive.\"\n\n6. If I assume the opponent might choose rock, then paper would be my best counter, giving me +3 points.\n\n7. Paper also beats scissors for +1 point, and only loses to rock.\n\n8. Given that this is against a fresh player who might gravitate toward rock, and paper gives me the maximum possible points when it wins, I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

I lost and got -1 points (the hint says I won with +1 points, but according to the rules, paper loses to scissors, so I think there might be an error in the hint - I'll assume I actually lost).\n\n2. Now I have information about my opponent's behavior: they chose scissors in round 1.\n\n3. I need to consider what they might do in round 2. Some possibilities:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - They might switch to counter what I played (rock to beat my paper)\n   - They might try rock as a \"stronger\" move\n   - They could go completely random\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Since they just succeeded with scissors against my paper, there's a reasonable chance they might try scissors again, or they might try to counter-counter by playing rock (thinking I'll adjust).\n\n6. Given the high reward for beating rock with paper (+3 points), and the fact that many players might switch to rock after winning with scissors, I think paper gives me the best risk-reward balance.\n\n7. Paper gives me maximum points if they choose rock, and only loses to scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

Rock beats paper, so I lost -3 points.\n\n3. Current pattern from opponent: scissors, then rock. This shows they're not sticking to one move.\n\n4. My current score appears to be -3 points (or -4 if round 1 was correctly scored).\n\n5. Now I need to predict their round 3 move. They've played scissors and rock, so they might:\n   - Complete the cycle with paper\n   - Go back to scissors (which worked in round 1)\n   - Stick with rock (which just worked well)\n   - Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n6.

Since they just got a big win (+3) with rock, they might be tempted to play rock again. However, they might also think I'll adjust and play paper to counter rock, so they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n8.

My current score: -5 + 0 = -5 points. Still significantly behind.\n\n4. Important observations:\n   - They just played paper twice in a row (rounds 9-10)\n   - This is the first time they've repeated any move consecutively except rock\n   - Paper usage is increasing: appeared in rounds 4, 9, and 10\n   - They might be shifting away from their rock preference\n\n5. Recent trend analysis:\n   - Last 3 rounds: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They seem to be moving toward paper more frequently\n   - This could be adaptation to counter my strategies\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played paper twice, which is unusual for them\n   - They might continue this trend, expecting me to not counter it\n   - Or they might switch back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - Given that I'm far behind and need points, and they're showing increased paper usage, scissors gives me +1 if they continue with paper\n\n8. Since they've played paper twice in a row and this represents a potential new pattern, I'll counter with scissors to capitalize on this trend.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Key observations:\n   - They went back to rock after playing paper twice\n   - Rock is now at 6/11 rounds (54.5%) - still their most frequent choice\n   - Every time I've played scissors against their rock, I've won (+1 each time in rounds 3, 8, 11)\n   - My scissors vs their rock record: 3 wins, 0 losses\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - Recent sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to alternate between rock phases and brief experiments with other moves\n   - Rock remains their go-to move\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with rock (their favorite), scissors gives me +1\n   - If they switch to paper, scissors loses -1\n   - If they switch to scissors, it's a tie\n   - My scissors strategy has been very effective against their rock preference\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors has worked perfectly against their rock (3/3 success rate)\n   - They just returned to rock after the paper experiment\n   - They might stick with rock or try something else\n\n8. Given their strong historical preference for rock (54.5% of rounds), the fact that they just played rock again after experimenting with paper, and my perfect 3-0 record with scissors vs their rock, I should continue with scissors. It's been my most successful strategy against their most common move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Counter-strategy considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper (expecting my scissors), I should play scissors (+1)\n   - But they're using paper specifically because they expect scissors\n   - If I switch to rock, I beat scissors (+1) or tie with rock (0)\n   - If I switch to paper, I beat rock (+3) or tie with paper (0)\n\n8.

Opponent's complete pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   They've now played rock three times total, paper once, and scissors once.\n\n3. My current score: -1 + (-3) + 1 + 0 + 0 = -3 points. Still need to catch up significantly.\n\n4. Analyzing opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They seem to favor rock (3 out of 5 rounds)\n   - After our paper tie, they went to rock\n   - After our rock tie, they might switch again or stick with rock\n\n5. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've shown they can repeat moves (rock appeared in rounds 2, 3, and 5)\n   - They might be expecting me to try to counter rock with paper\n   - Or they might switch to scissors or paper to avoid another tie\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play rock again, paper gives me +3 points (maximum gain)\n   - If they switch to scissors, rock gives me +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper, scissors gives me +1 point\n\n7. Given that they just played rock and have shown a tendency to use rock frequently, but we just tied, they might:\n   - Switch away from rock to avoid another tie\n   - Expect me to play paper to counter rock, so they might play scissors\n\n8. However, since I'm significantly behind (-3 points) and need big gains, and they have shown a strong preference for rock, I think the risk-reward favors playing paper. If they stick with rock again, I get +3 points which would bring me to 0. This is my best chance to catch up quickly.\n\n[move] Paper",

Wait, I need to check the scoring again. Paper vs scissors: scissors beats paper, so I should have lost -1 points, not won +1. But the hint says I won with +1 points. Let me assume the hint is correct and continue.\n\n3. Opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   They've now used scissors twice (rounds 1 and 6), rock three times, and paper once.\n\n4. My current score (assuming hint is correct): -1 + (-3) + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = -2 points. Still behind but improving.\n\n5. Analyzing recent behavior:\n   - They went back to scissors after playing rock in round 5\n   - They seem to cycle through moves somewhat unpredictably\n   - Scissors appeared in rounds 1 and 6 (5 rounds apart)\n\n6. Possible opponent strategies:\n   - They might continue with scissors since it just worked\n   - They might switch to rock (their most frequent choice)\n   - They might try paper to complete another cycle\n\n7.

Given that scissors just worked for them against my paper, they might either:\n   - Stick with scissors (expecting me to not repeat paper)\n   - Switch to rock (their favorite move)\n   - Try to be unpredictable\n\n9.

If they're trying to counter my previous moves, they've successfully beaten my paper twice with different moves, so they might expect me to switch.\n\n5. Looking at what would beat paper (if that's their next move): scissors would give me +1 point.\n\n6. However, I need to consider other possibilities:\n   - If they stick with rock (since it just gave them +3 points), I should play paper\n   - If they go back to scissors, I should play rock\n   - If they try paper, I should play scissors\n\n7. Given that rock just gave them a big +3 point win, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with the winning strategy and play rock again.\n\n8. But I also notice they haven't repeated a move yet, suggesting they might be deliberately varying their strategy.\n\n9. Since I'm down -4 points, I need to be more aggressive about getting the high-value wins. If there's any chance they play rock again, paper gives me +3 points.\n\n10. However, the pattern suggests they might try paper next, so scissors would be the counter.\n\nI'll go with scissors to counter a potential paper play, as it fits the pattern and gives me a chance to start recovering points.\n\n[move] Scissors",

According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have lost -1 points, but the hint said I won +1 points. There seems to be confusion in the scoring.\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock. Rock beats paper, so I lost -3 points correctly.\n\n2. My opponent's pattern so far: scissors, then rock. This suggests they might be cycling through moves or trying to counter my previous choices.\n\n3. Current situation analysis:\n   - My opponent has shown they're willing to use both scissors and rock\n   - They might continue the pattern with paper next, or they might try to counter what they expect me to play\n   - Since I've played paper twice, they might expect me to continue or switch\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play paper next (continuing their cycle), I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they try to counter my paper pattern by playing scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock again, I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Given that they just beat me with rock, they might either:\n   - Stick with rock since it worked well (+3 points for them)\n   - Move to paper to complete a cycle\n   - Try scissors to counter if they think I'll switch from paper\n\n6. Since rock just gave them a big win, there's a decent chance they might repeat it. Playing paper again would give me +3 if they do repeat rock, but I just lost badly with paper.\n\n7. I think scissors is a good choice here - it beats paper (if they cycle) and beats rock isn't as likely to repeat immediately after such a big win.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - They don't seem to have a predictable pattern\n   - They've used: scissors (1x), rock (2x), paper (1x)\n   - They just switched to paper after playing rock twice\n\n5. Since they just played paper and got a tie, they might:\n   - Switch away from paper (since it didn't give them an advantage)\n   - Try scissors (which worked well in round 1)\n   - Go back to rock (which gave them their biggest win)\n   - Stick with paper\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play paper again, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Given that they just tied with paper, I think they're likely to switch to either scissors or rock. Since rock gave them their biggest payoff earlier (+3 in round 2), there's a reasonable chance they might return to it.\n\n8. I'll play paper again, betting that they'll try rock. This gives me the potential for +3 points which I need to catch up.\n\n[move] Paper",

Given their overwhelming tendency to play rock, and the fact that they just played rock again, there are two possibilities:\n   - They continue with rock (very likely based on pattern)\n   - They switch because they might expect me to finally counter with scissors\n\n7. However, since I'm so far behind (-5 points), I need to start making the right reads. Their rock frequency is too high to ignore. Even if they occasionally switch, the probability strongly favors rock.\n\n8. I should finally counter their rock preference with scissors.

Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Decision reasoning:\n   - They just played paper twice, which is unusual for them\n   - They might continue this trend, expecting me to not counter it\n   - Or they might switch back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - Given that I'm far behind and need points, and they're showing increased paper usage, scissors gives me +1 if they continue with paper\n\n8. Since they've played paper twice in a row and this represents a potential new pattern, I'll counter with scissors to capitalize on this trend.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Adaptation analysis:\n   - They seem to be catching on to my scissors strategy\n   - When I played scissors in rounds 9 and 12, they countered with paper both times\n   - They might be specifically adapting to counter my scissors\n\n6. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - My scissors vs rock strategy worked great (3-0 record)\n   - But they're now using paper more frequently, which beats scissors\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors\n\n7. Decision considerations:\n   - If they continue with paper (expecting scissors), I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they go back to rock, I should play paper (+3 points) \n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n8. Given that they just played paper and seem to be adapting to counter my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with paper if they think I'll stick with scissors\n   - Switch back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - Try scissors to complete the cycle\n\n9. Since I'm far behind (-5 points) and need to maximize points, and considering they might return to rock (their most common move historically), I'll play paper. This gives me the maximum +3 points if they go back to rock, and I need big gains to catch up.\n\n[move] Paper",
