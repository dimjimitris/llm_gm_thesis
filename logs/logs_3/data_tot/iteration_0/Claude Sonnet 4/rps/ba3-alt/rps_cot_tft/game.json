Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n3. Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 payoffs, making them lower risk but also lower reward.\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Make somewhat random choices\n   - May not fully understand the payoff differences\n\n5. Given that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper, and fresh players might gravitate toward rock, I should consider what beats rock: scissors.\n\n6. However, if the fresh player chooses paper (which many beginners do), scissors would give me +1 points.\n\n7. Since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, I'll choose scissors because:\n   - It beats rock (which new players often choose) for +1\n   - It loses to paper for only -1 (not the harsh -3 penalty)\n   - It's a relatively safe choice to start with\n\n[move] scissors",

Evaluate my options:\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I choose paper and they choose scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I choose paper and they choose paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper has the potential for the highest single gain (+3 vs rock)\n   - The penalty for losing with paper is moderate (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Given that beginners often choose rock, paper seems like a good strategic choice\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's tendency to choose rock, while accepting the moderate risk.\n\n[move] paper",
