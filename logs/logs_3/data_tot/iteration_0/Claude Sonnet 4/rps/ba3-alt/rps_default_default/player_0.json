    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, their move choice is probably random or based on common human tendencies.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, many new players tend to start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 points against scissors, while potentially gaining +3 against rock.\n\n[move] paper"

The tie might reset their thinking, or they might expect me to change after the tie.\n\nAfter ties, looking at what happened previously:\n- After round 1 tie (paper): they chose rock\n- After round 2 tie (rock): they chose paper  \n- After round 4 tie (rock): they chose paper\n- After round 8 tie (rock): they chose paper\n\nThere's a pattern! After rock ties, they've chosen paper 3 out of 3 times. This is a strong tendency I can exploit.\n\nIf they follow this pattern and choose paper, my scissors would beat it for +1 point.\n\n[move] scissors"

However, they just used rock, not paper.\n\nI think scissors is worth the risk here to counter their potential rock repeat.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "Great! I won +1 point by beating their rock with scissors. This is actually the first time I've won with scissors in this entire game! Here's the updated pattern:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 3: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 points)\n- Round 4: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 5: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 points)\n- Round 6: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 7: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 8: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 10: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 11: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 12: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 13: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 14: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 16: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 17: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 18: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 19: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I lost -3 points)\n- Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won +1 point)\n\nCurrent total: +6 points\n\nInteresting development! My scissors finally succeeded because they chose rock instead of their usual paper counter. This breaks their perfect 4/4 record of beating my scissors with paper.\n\nTheir sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock\n\nUpdated counts:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nKey observations:\n- They chose rock twice in a row (rounds 20 and 21)\n- This is only the second time they've repeated the same move consecutively (first was paper in rounds 5-6)\n- My previously established pattern of \"when I choose scissors \u2192 they choose paper\" has been broken\n\nNow I need to predict their next move. They just lost with rock to my scissors. Looking at what they do after losing:\n- After losses, they've shown various responses, becoming less predictable\n\nSince they just lost with rock, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (to beat my potential scissors repeat)\n2. Switch to scissors (to counter expected paper from me)\n3. Try rock again (doubling down)\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern of countering my scissors with paper, and considering they might expect me to try scissors again since it finally worked, they could revert to their old reliable paper strategy.\n\nIf they choose paper, my rock beats it for +3. If they choose scissors, my rock loses -1. If they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] rock"

Here's the updated pattern:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 3: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 points)\n- Round 4: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 5: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 points)\n- Round 6: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 7: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 8: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 9: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 10: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 11: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 12: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 13: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 14: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 15: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 16: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n- Round 17: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n- Round 18: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 19: I chose rock, they chose scissors (I lost -1 point)\n- Round 20: I chose paper, they chose rock (I lost -3 points)\n- Round 21: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won +1 point)\n- Round 22: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won +3 points)\n\nCurrent total: +9 points\n\nBack to +9 points! The opponent returned to their paper choice after losing with rock, which allowed me to capitalize with rock for the maximum reward.\n\nTheir sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper\n\nUpdated counts:\n- Paper: 9 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nKey patterns still emerging:\n1. **When I beat their paper with rock \u2192 they choose scissors next round** (happened in rounds 7, 11, 17, and likely round 23)\n2. They still have a slight preference for paper overall (9/22 = 41%)\n3. After losing, they often revert to paper or try to counter-predict\n\nGiven the established pattern that after I beat their paper with rock, they choose scissors in the next round (3/3 times previously), I should expect scissors in round 23.\n\nIf they choose scissors (following the pattern), my paper would beat it for +1 point. If they break the pattern and choose paper, my rock would beat it for +3. If they choose rock, my paper loses -3.\n\nBased on the strong historical pattern of them choosing scissors after I beat their paper with rock, paper seems like the optimal choice.\n\n[move] paper"

This confirms the pattern: when I beat their paper with rock, they choose scissors in the next round (now 4/4 times).

I'm now at +10 points and have identified a very reliable pattern.\n\nTheir sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors\n\n**Confirmed patterns:**\n1. **When I beat their paper with rock \u2192 they choose scissors next round (4/4 times, 100%)**\n2. **When I beat their scissors with paper \u2192 they choose rock next round (4/4 times, 100%)**\n\nThis creates a predictable cycle: Rock beats their paper \u2192 they choose scissors \u2192 Paper beats their scissors \u2192 they choose rock \u2192 repeat\n\nSince I just beat their scissors with paper, based on the established pattern, they should choose rock in round 24.\n\nIf they choose rock (following the pattern), my scissors would beat it for +1 point. If they break the pattern and choose paper, my rock would beat it for +3. If they choose scissors, my scissors ties for 0.\n\nBased on the 4/4 pattern reliability, I'm confident they'll choose rock.\n\n[move] scissors"
