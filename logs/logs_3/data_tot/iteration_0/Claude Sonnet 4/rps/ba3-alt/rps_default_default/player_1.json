The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

My total is now -8 points (-5 - 3 = -8).\n\nUpdated sequence:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 3: I paper, they scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 4: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 5: I paper, they scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 6: I paper, they rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 7: I scissors, they paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 8: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 9: I paper, they scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 10: I paper, they rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 11: I scissors, they paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 12: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 13: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 14: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 15: I paper, they scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 16: I paper, they rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 17: I scissors, they paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 18: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 19: I scissors, they rock (I won +1)\n- Round 20: I rock, they paper (I won +3)\n- Round 21: I rock, they scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 22: I paper, they rock (I lost -3)\n\nI'm back to -8 points. My opponent is playing exceptionally well - they're consistently one step ahead of my thinking. After winning with scissors, they switched to rock, correctly anticipating I might play paper.\n\nLooking at their recent moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. That's the classic cycle! If they continue this pattern, they'd go to paper next.\n\nAfter winning with rock, they might:\n1. Continue the cycle to paper\n2. Stick with rock since it just worked\n3. Switch to scissors expecting me to counter rock\n\nI've been getting outplayed by trying to predict their moves. Maybe I should focus on what gives me the best mathematical outcome. If they play paper (continuing cycle) and I play scissors, I win 1 point. If they stick with rock and I play scissors, I win 1 point. If they play scissors and I play scissors, it's a tie.\n\nScissors seems like a reasonable choice here.\n\n[move] (Playing scissors to either beat paper if they continue their cycle or beat rock if they repeat their successful move) scissors"

My opponent has been incredibly effective - they correctly predicted I would play scissors and countered with paper. They've been following cycles and patterns very well.\n\nTheir recent sequence was: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they continue this cycle, they'd go to scissors next. But I've been wrong about cycles before.\n\nI'm in a very deep hole at -9 points. I need to start taking some calculated risks. Rock gives the highest reward when it wins. If they play scissors (continuing the cycle) and I play rock, I win 1 point. If they play paper and I play rock, I win 3 points. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\nAt this deficit, I need to go for higher rewards.\n\n[move] (Playing rock for the highest reward potential, desperately needing to recover from this deep -9 point deficit) rock"
