Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, their move choice is probably random or based on common human tendencies.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, many new players tend to start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 points against scissors, while potentially gaining +3 against rock.\n\n[move] paper"

My pattern analysis was wrong - instead of choosing paper after the rock tie (as they had done 3/3 times before), they chose scissors just like me. This suggests:\n\n1. They're adapting and breaking their previous patterns\n2. We're thinking more similarly now\n3. They might be reading my strategy too\n\nTheir complete sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors\n\nUpdated counts:\n- Paper: 6 times\n- Rock: 4 times  \n- Scissors: 3 times\n\nThey're becoming more balanced in their choices. The question now is: what do they do after a scissors tie?\n\nThis is only the first scissors tie we've had, so I don't have historical data for this situation. However, looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be moving away from predictable patterns.\n\nGiven that we just tied with scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to rock (to beat expected scissors)\n2. Switch to paper (their historical favorite)\n3. Stay unpredictable\n\nSince rock beats scissors for +1 point, and they might expect me to try scissors again or switch to paper, I think rock is a solid choice here.\n\n[move] rock"

They just lost with rock to my scissors. Looking at what they do after losing:\n- After losses, they've shown various responses, becoming less predictable\n\nSince they just lost with rock, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (to beat my potential scissors repeat)\n2. Switch to scissors (to counter expected paper from me)\n3. Try rock again (doubling down)\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern of countering my scissors with paper, and considering they might expect me to try scissors again since it finally worked, they could revert to their old reliable paper strategy.\n\nIf they choose paper, my rock beats it for +3. If they choose scissors, my rock loses -1. If they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] rock"

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, their move choice is probably random or based on common human tendencies.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, many new players tend to start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\"), so playing paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only risks -1 points against scissors, while potentially gaining +3 against rock.\n\n[move] paper",

My scissors finally succeeded because they chose rock instead of their usual paper counter. This breaks their perfect 4/4 record of beating my scissors with paper.\n\nTheir sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock\n\nUpdated counts:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nKey observations:\n- They chose rock twice in a row (rounds 20 and 21)\n- This is only the second time they've repeated the same move consecutively (first was paper in rounds 5-6)\n- My previously established pattern of \"when I choose scissors \u2192 they choose paper\" has been broken\n\nNow I need to predict their next move. They just lost with rock to my scissors. Looking at what they do after losing:\n- After losses, they've shown various responses, becoming less predictable\n\nSince they just lost with rock, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (to beat my potential scissors repeat)\n2. Switch to scissors (to counter expected paper from me)\n3. Try rock again (doubling down)\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern of countering my scissors with paper, and considering they might expect me to try scissors again since it finally worked, they could revert to their old reliable paper strategy.\n\nIf they choose paper, my rock beats it for +3. If they choose scissors, my rock loses -1. If they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] rock",

The question now is: what do they do after a scissors tie?\n\nThis is only the first scissors tie we've had, so I don't have historical data for this situation. However, looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be moving away from predictable patterns.\n\nGiven that we just tied with scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to rock (to beat expected scissors)\n2. Switch to paper (their historical favorite)\n3.

Rock beats paper for +3 points, and even if they switch strategies, the worst case is -1 against scissors.\n\nSince they've chosen paper 7 out of 15 times (nearly 50%), and just used it successfully, rock gives me the best expected value.\n\n[move] rock",

After losing with scissors to my paper, they've chosen rock both times (2/2). If this pattern holds, they might choose rock again.\n\nIf they choose rock, my paper would lose -3 points (the maximum penalty). If they break the pattern and choose paper, it's a tie. If they choose scissors again, I win +1.\n\nGiven their consistent pattern of choosing rock after losing with scissors to my paper, I should choose scissors to beat their expected rock for +1 point.\n\n[move] scissors",

Since they just beat my rock with scissors, what do they typically do after winning?\n\nLooking at their wins against me:\n- Round 3: beat my scissors with paper \u2192 chose rock next\n- Round 5: beat my scissors with paper \u2192 chose paper next  \n- Round 19: beat my rock with scissors \u2192 ???\n\nNot enough data for this specific situation. However, if I think about their general strategy, they might expect me to switch away from rock (since it just lost) or try to counter their scissors.\n\nIf they expect me to use paper to beat their scissors, they might choose rock. If they think I'll avoid rock after the loss, they might go back to paper.\n\nGiven their recent adaptation and the fact that paper is still their most frequent choice, I think paper is a reasonable choice - it beats scissors (+1) and ties with paper.\n\n[move] paper",

Based on historical patterns, what do they do after successfully using scissors?\n\nLooking at their scissors wins:\n- This is actually their first scissors win against me!\n- Previously when they used scissors (rounds 7, 11, 13, 17), I either beat them or tied\n\nSince this is new territory, I need to think about their likely next move. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors (since it just worked)\n2. Switch to paper (their most common choice overall)\n3. Follow some other pattern\n\nGiven that scissors just gave them success, and considering they've been breaking patterns lately, I think paper is a safe choice - it beats scissors (+1) and only loses to rock (-3).\n\n[move] paper",

Try rock again (doubling down)\n\nGiven that they broke their pattern of countering my scissors with paper, and considering they might expect me to try scissors again since it finally worked, they could revert to their old reliable paper strategy.\n\nIf they choose paper, my rock beats it for +3. If they choose scissors, my rock loses -1. If they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\n[move] rock",

This breaks the perfect pattern of them beating my scissors with paper.

Trying to be more unpredictable\n\nTheir sequence: paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock\n\nUpdated counts:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nThey're becoming very balanced now. Since I just beat their rock with scissors, and based on previous patterns, they used to choose scissors after I beat their paper with rock. But their patterns are evolving.\n\nGiven that they just lost with rock to my scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (to counter expected scissors from me)\n2. Try scissors (to be unpredictable)\n3. Stick with rock (doubling down)\n\nBased on their historical behavior and the fact that I just won with scissors, they might expect me to try scissors again and counter with paper. But I should be cautious since they've shown they can adapt their scissors-counter strategy.\n\nI think rock is a solid choice here - it beats their likely paper choice for +3 points.\n\n[move] rock",
