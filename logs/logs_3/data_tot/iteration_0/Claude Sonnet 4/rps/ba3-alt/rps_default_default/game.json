Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might make random moves or follow common human tendencies. Many people instinctively choose rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff when successful, and considering this is against an inexperienced player, I'll go with paper to potentially counter a rock choice while avoiding the high-risk rock play myself.\n\n[move] paper"

Expect me to switch to paper (to beat scissors) and play rock to counter\n\nGiven their tendency to try to counter my expected next move, and since scissors just beat my rock, they might expect me to play paper next. If they think I'll play paper, they should play scissors to beat it.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. Their pattern shows they react to losses more than successes. When they win, they sometimes repeat, but when they lose, they definitely switch to counter my winning move.\n\nSince they just won with scissors, they might stick with it, expecting me to play rock again. If they play scissors again, I should play rock for +3.\n\nBut given their smart reactive play, I think they'll expect me to switch to paper to beat scissors, so they might play scissors to beat paper... that doesn't work.\n\nActually, if they expect me to play paper (to beat their scissors), they should play scissors to beat paper. That means scissors vs scissors = tie.\n\nLet me play paper to beat their likely scissors continuation.\n\n[move] paper",
