    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they may choose randomly or go with common first instincts.\n\nMany new players tend to choose Rock first (it's often the default choice people think of), so playing Paper would be a good counter-strategy to potentially win 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nWait, that doesn't match what happened. The hint says paper beats scissors and gives +1 to the winner, but my opponent chose scissors and I chose paper, yet I won. This suggests there might be an error in my understanding or the game description.\n\nHowever, taking the result at face value: my opponent chose Scissors in the first round. For this second round, I need to think about their likely next move. They might:\n1. Stick with Scissors\n2. Switch to counter what they think I'll do\n3. Choose randomly\n\nSince Rock beats Paper with the highest reward (+3), and if they think I might stick with Paper or choose predictably, I'll go with Rock to try for the maximum points.\n\n[move] Rock"
