He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed any specific patterns yet. They might choose randomly or go with common first moves.\n\n4. Analyze common first-move tendencies: Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often the default choice people think of first).\n\n5. Formulate strategy: If the opponent is likely to choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it and gain 3 points. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), which is better than the potential -3 penalty from choosing rock myself.\n\n6. Risk assessment: Paper is a relatively safe choice - it either wins big (+3 vs rock), ties (0 vs paper), or loses small (-1 vs scissors).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper as it has the best risk-reward profile against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] paper",

Since the opponent is fresh and rock has the highest payoff, I'll assume they might not immediately recognize the strategy of playing scissors to counter rock-heavy play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential gain, betting that a fresh player is more likely to play paper or rock than scissors.\n\n[move] rock",
