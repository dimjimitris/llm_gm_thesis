    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties: 0 points for both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - If my opponent plays paper, I want to play rock for maximum gain (+3)\n   - If my opponent plays rock, I should avoid paper (would lose -3)\n   - The high penalty for paper losing to rock makes paper a risky choice\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced):\n   - New players often start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - If they play rock, I should play scissors to win +1\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock to win +3\n   - Rock seems like a reasonable opening move since it either wins big against paper or ties against rock\n\n5. Opening move decision:\n   - Rock gives me the chance for maximum reward if opponent plays paper\n   - Even if opponent plays rock (tie), I don't lose points\n   - Only loses to scissors, but fresh players are less likely to start with scissors\n\n[move] rock"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock, so I lost -1 points\n   - My assumption about fresh players preferring rock was wrong\n\n2. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They're willing to play scissors as an opening move\n   - They might be more strategic than I initially thought\n   - Or they could be playing randomly/unpredictably\n\n3. Consider my options for this round:\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play rock to win +1\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play scissors), I should play paper to win +3\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock to win +3\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Many players will switch after winning, so they might not play scissors again\n   - Rock is still attractive because it wins the maximum points against paper\n   - Paper is risky because losing to rock costs -3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock but only wins +1\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - Given the high reward for rock beating paper (+3), and that opponents often vary their moves\n   - Rock remains a solid choice - it either wins big against paper, ties against rock, or loses small against scissors\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors rock\n\n[move] rock"
