    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant, I need to analyze the payoff structure to make an optimal decision.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know the optimal strategy yet.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies.\n\n5. Given the high reward for rock (+3 points) and the likelihood that a new player might choose rock, playing paper would be optimal to counter this tendency.\n\n6. Even if the opponent doesn't choose rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving -1), which is much better than the potential -3 penalty from playing rock and facing paper.\n\n7. Playing paper minimizes my maximum loss while still giving me a chance at significant gains if the opponent plays scissors or rock.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player while minimizing potential losses.\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Looking at the results from the previous round, I need to analyze what happened and adjust my strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Previous round analysis:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Paper loses to scissors, so I should have gotten -1 points\n   - But the hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 1 points\"\n   - This suggests paper actually beats scissors in this variant (opposite of standard rules)\n\n2. Re-examine the payoff structure given this new information:\n   - The rules stated \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - This confirms paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n   - So the payoffs are: Paper > Scissors, Rock > Paper, Scissors > Rock\n\n3. Strategy considerations for round 2:\n   - My opponent just played scissors and lost\n   - They might switch to a different move to avoid losing again\n   - If they think I'll stick with paper, they might play rock (which beats paper for +3)\n   - If they want to counter what they think I'll do, they might expect me to change\n\n4. Given that rock gives the highest reward (+3) and my opponent might avoid scissors after losing, I should consider what counters rock.\n\n5. Scissors beats rock for +1 point, and if my opponent switches to rock thinking I'll play paper again, scissors would be optimal.\n\n6. However, if they play paper, I'd lose -1. The risk-reward seems reasonable.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential rock response from my opponent.\n\n[move] scissors"
