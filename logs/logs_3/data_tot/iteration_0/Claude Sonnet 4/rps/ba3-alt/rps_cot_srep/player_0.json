    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - May go with their first instinct\n   - Haven't optimized for the unusual payoff structure\n\n4. Optimal strategy consideration: If opponents favor rock, then paper becomes very valuable since it beats rock for +3 points. Even if there's only a moderate chance they choose rock, the high payoff makes paper attractive.\n\n5. Decision: Choose paper because:\n   - It has the potential for the highest gain (+3) against rock\n   - Fresh players often default to rock\n   - The risk is manageable (-1 if they choose scissors)\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - I lost and got -1 points (not +1 as the hint incorrectly stated)\n   - This means scissors beats paper in this variant, giving +1 to scissors player and -1 to paper player\n\n2. Correct my understanding of the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (this seems incorrect based on the result)\n   - Let me re-read: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - But I got -1 points when I played paper vs scissors, so either:\n     a) The hint about my score is wrong, or\n     b) I misunderstood the rules\n\n3. Wait - the hint says \"You won the round\" but also that I scored 1 point when I played paper vs scissors. This matches the original rule that paper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\n4. Strategy for next round:\n   - The opponent chose scissors last time\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think it worked (but it actually lost)\n   - They might switch to counter what they expect me to play\n   - Since they played scissors (lower value move), they might not be optimizing for the high-value rock play yet\n\n5. Decision: I'll choose rock this time because:\n   - If they repeat scissors, I win +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I might repeat paper), I lose but only -3\n   - If they choose rock, it's a tie\n   - Rock protects against scissors repeat while giving me a chance for the moderate +1 gain\n\n[move] rock"

Critical realization:\n   - Opponent may have been analyzing MY pattern too!\n   - I played rock 4 times in rounds 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 - they learned I favor rock\n   - When I finally switched to paper, they countered with rock for maximum damage\n   - They might be more strategic than I assumed\n\n5. New strategic considerations:\n   - Opponent has now used all three moves\n   - They may have been saving rock as a surprise counter\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - Current distribution suggests they're moving toward balance\n\n6. Decision: Play scissors because:\n   - If opponent continues with rock (riding their success), I win +1\n   - If opponent goes back to paper (their previous preference), I lose -1\n   - If opponent plays scissors, it's a tie\n   - I need to counter the possibility they'll repeat rock after that big win\n   - Scissors is my least-played move, making me less predictable\n\n[move] scissors"

Critical strategic insight:\n   - Opponent is using rock STRATEGICALLY, not randomly\n   - Both times they played rock (rounds 9 and 12), I had paper and lost -3 points\n   - They seem to be countering my strategies: when I switched to paper, they punished with rock\n   - This suggests they're reading my patterns and adapting\n\n5. Meta-game analysis:\n   - I've been too predictable in my strategy shifts\n   - When I focused on rock early, they avoided it\n   - When I switched to paper to counter scissors, they punished with rock\n   - I need to be more unpredictable and consider their counter-strategies\n\n6.

Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-18: S, P, P, S, P, P, S, S, R, S, S, R, S, P, S, S, S, R\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Paper: 5/19 (26%), Scissors: 11/19 (58%), Rock: 3/19 (16%)\n\n4. Strategic insights:\n   - Opponent returned to scissors after their rock punishment\n   - This confirms their scissors preference is real (58%), not just bait\n   - Rock usage remains strategic - only used for pattern punishment (16%)\n   - Recent sequence: R \u2192 S shows they revert to preference after punishing\n\n5. Key realization:\n   - Their strategy is: maintain genuine scissors preference + punish my patterns with rock\n   - The scissors preference gives me opportunities, but I must avoid repetition\n   - I need to exploit their scissors tendency while staying unpredictable\n\n6. Strategic approach:\n   - Paper still has positive expected value against their distribution\n   - But I must avoid playing paper consecutively to prevent rock punishment\n   - Mix my plays while still capitalizing on their 58% scissors rate\n   - Since I just played scissors (breaking my paper pattern), they might not expect paper now\n\n7. Decision: Play paper because:\n   - Opponent strongly prefers scissors (58%)\n   - I just broke my paper pattern with scissors, so rock punishment is less likely\n   - One round gap might be enough to reset their punishment trigger\n   - Paper vs scissors gives me +1 (what I need to climb back)\n   - I need to balance exploitation with unpredictability\n\n[move] paper"

Review round 20 result:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - I won and scored +1 point\n   - My strategy of waiting one round before returning to paper worked!\n\n2. Current score tracking:\n   - Total through round 19: -4 points\n   - Round 20: +1 point\n   - Total: -3 points (slowly recovering again)\n\n3. Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-19: S, P, P, S, P, P, S, S, R, S, S, R, S, P, S, S, S, R, S\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Paper: 5/20 (25%), Scissors: 12/20 (60%), Rock: 3/20 (15%)\n\n4. Pattern confirmation and warning:\n   - Scissors preference has strengthened to 60%\n   - I just won with paper vs scissors again\n   - Historical pattern: when I win with paper, they often punish repeats with rock\n   - Round 12: Won with paper \u2192 repeated paper \u2192 got punished with rock (-3)\n   - Round 18: Won twice with paper \u2192 got punished with rock (-3)\n\n5. Critical decision point:\n   - I want to exploit their 60% scissors preference\n   - But I MUST avoid the rock punishment pattern\n   - The key is not repeating paper immediately after winning with it\n   - I need to break the pattern while still capitalizing on their scissors tendency\n\n6. Strategy: Avoid immediate repetition\n   - Don't play paper right after winning with paper\n   - Play something else this round, then potentially return to paper later\n   - This prevents triggering their punishment mechanism\n\n7. Decision: Play rock because:\n   - If opponent plays their preferred scissors (60%), I win +1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, I lose -3, but their paper usage is only 25%\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - Expected value: 0.60 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.25 \u00d7 (-3) + 0.15 \u00d7 (0) = -0.15 points\n   - Wait, that's negative... but I need to avoid the pattern trap\n   - Rock breaks my pattern and still has a decent chance against their scissors preference\n\n[move] rock"

Review round 21 result:\n   - I chose rock, opponent chose scissors\n   - I lost and scored -1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock, so this follows the rules correctly\n\n2. Current score tracking:\n   - Total through round 20: -3 points\n   - Round 21: -1 point\n   - Total: -4 points (back to where I was after the big loss)\n\n3. Updated opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Rounds 1-20: S, P, P, S, P, P, S, S, R, S, S, R, S, P, S, S, S, R, S, S\n   - Round 21: Scissors\n   - Paper: 5/21 (24%), Scissors: 13/21 (62%), Rock: 3/21 (14%)\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - Opponent's scissors preference is now at 62% and still growing\n   - They played scissors again, continuing their genuine preference\n   - No rock punishment this time because I avoided repeating paper\n   - My pattern-breaking strategy worked to avoid the -3 penalty\n\n5. Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent's scissors preference appears to be real, not just bait\n   - Their rock usage (14%) is truly strategic - only for punishing my patterns\n   - Since I broke my pattern with rock, they might not expect paper punishment now\n   - I successfully avoided the -3 rock punishment by not repeating paper\n\n6. Decision analysis:\n   - Paper has strong positive expected value: 0.62 \u00d7 (+1) + 0.24 \u00d7 (0) + 0.14 \u00d7 (-3) = +0.20 points\n   - I'm at -4 points and need consistent small gains\n   - Since I just played rock (breaking patterns), paper might be safe from punishment\n   - Their 62% scissors rate is too strong to ignore\n\n7. Decision: Play paper because:\n   - Opponent heavily favors scissors (62%)\n   - I broke my pattern last round, so rock punishment risk is lower\n   - Paper vs scissors gives me the +1 points I need for recovery\n   - Expected value is positive (+0.20)\n   - I need to capitalize on their clear preference while staying unpredictable\n\n[move] paper"

Pattern shift observation:\n   - Opponent switched from scissors to paper after I broke my pattern with rock\n   - This might indicate they're adapting to my moves\n   - Recent sequence: S \u2192 P suggests they might be moving away from pure scissors preference\n   - Paper usage increased slightly (27% vs previous 24%)\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - The tie suggests we might be thinking similarly now\n   - Their scissors preference is still strong at 59% but declining slightly\n   - Rock usage remains low and strategic (14%)\n   - I avoided punishment by pattern-breaking, but got a tie instead of a win\n\n6. Meta-analysis:\n   - We've had 6 ties total, suggesting some convergent thinking\n   - Their genuine scissors preference gives me opportunities with paper\n   - But I must continue avoiding predictable patterns\n   - At -4 points, I need wins, not just ties\n\n7. Decision: Play rock because:\n   - If opponent returns to scissors preference (59% historical), I lose -1 but it's manageable\n   - If opponent continues with paper (they just played it), I win +3 points\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The potential +3 gain from paper repetition could significantly help my -4 deficit\n   - Rock also keeps me unpredictable after the paper tie\n\n[move] rock"

Significant pattern shift:\n   - Opponent just played rock for the fourth time\n   - This is notable because their previous rock usage was purely strategic/punishment\n   - Recent sequence: S \u2192 P \u2192 R shows they're cycling through all moves\n   - Rock usage has increased from 14% to 17%\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - Two consecutive ties (rounds 22-23) suggest we're thinking similarly\n   - Opponent might be becoming more balanced in their play\n   - Their scissors preference is still strongest (57%) but declining\n   - They're no longer as predictably scissors-focused\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - Seven ties suggests either:\n     a) We're both becoming more random/balanced\n     b) We're reading each other's patterns similarly\n   - I'm stuck at -4 points and need to break out of this tie pattern\n   - Need to find a way to exploit remaining patterns while avoiding more ties\n\n7. Decision: Play paper because:\n   - Opponent still has highest preference for scissors (57%)\n   - Even though they just played rock, their historical tendency is scissors\n   - Paper vs scissors gives me +1 point (what I need for steady recovery)\n   - If they continue balancing their play, paper has reasonable expected value\n   - I need to break the tie streak and get back to winning rounds\n\n[move] paper"
