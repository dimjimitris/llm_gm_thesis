Let me examine the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of), so playing paper could be advantageous since it beats rock and gives me +3 points.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that if they play scissors, I'd lose 1 point. But the potential gain of +3 from beating rock seems worth the risk against a new player.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me recalculate:\n\nIf I played paper and my opponent played rock, and I lost 3 points, that means rock beats paper (not the other way around as I initially thought). So the correct payoffs are:\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock player, -3 for paper player\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper player, -1 for scissors player  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors player, -1 for rock player\n\nNow I know my opponent just played rock. Many players either stick with what worked or try to counter-predict. Since rock just won them 3 points, they might play it again. If they do play rock again, I should play scissors to beat it and gain 1 point.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll expect them to repeat rock and switch to scissors to beat my potential scissors play. This is getting into mind games, but against a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll either stick with rock (since it just worked) or switch somewhat randomly.\n\nPlaying scissors gives me the best chance against rock, and even if they play paper, I only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let me examine the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have symmetric +1/-1 payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value. Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of), so playing paper could be advantageous since it beats rock and gives me +3 points.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that if they play scissors, I'd lose 1 point.

Let me recalculate:\n\nIf I played paper and my opponent played rock, and I lost 3 points, that means rock beats paper (not the other way around as I initially thought). So the correct payoffs are:\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock player, -3 for paper player\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper player, -1 for scissors player  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors player, -1 for rock player\n\nNow I know my opponent just played rock. Many players either stick with what worked or try to counter-predict. Since rock just won them 3 points, they might play it again. If they do play rock again, I should play scissors to beat it and gain 1 point.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll expect them to repeat rock and switch to scissors to beat my potential scissors play. This is getting into mind games, but against a fresh player, I think there's a reasonable chance they'll either stick with rock (since it just worked) or switch somewhat randomly.\n\nPlaying scissors gives me the best chance against rock, and even if they play paper, I only lose 1 point rather than 3.\n\n[move] scissors",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

However, some of their streaks went to 4 or 5, so they might continue rock.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that scissors has been working well against their rock streak, I'll continue with scissors.
