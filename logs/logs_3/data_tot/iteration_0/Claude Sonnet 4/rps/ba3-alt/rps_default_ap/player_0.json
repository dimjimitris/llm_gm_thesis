    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose rock first (it feels strong/aggressive)\n2. Make somewhat random choices\n3. Haven't optimized for the asymmetric payoffs\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential reward (+3), but fresh players might gravitate toward it, I should consider playing paper to counter a potential rock choice. This would give me +3 points if they choose rock.\n\nHowever, if they choose randomly, I want to balance risk and reward. Paper seems like a good choice because:\n- It beats rock for +3 points (high reward)\n- It loses to scissors for only -1 point (low penalty)\n- It ties with paper for 0 points\n\n[move] paper"
