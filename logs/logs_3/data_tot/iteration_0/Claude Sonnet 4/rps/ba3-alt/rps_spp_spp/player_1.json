    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to identify helpful personas and develop a strategy for this rock-paper-scissors variant game.\n\n**Personas:** AI Assistant (me); Game Theory Expert; Strategic Analyst\n\n**Start collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze the payoff matrix first. This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1). This creates an interesting strategic dynamic.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know the modified payoff structure yet. Most people default to rock in rock-paper-scissors games initially. However, the high reward for rock (3 points) might tempt experienced players to use it more often than in standard games.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, what should our opening move be?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** In standard rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy is random play (1/3 each move). But with these payoffs, we need to consider:\n1. Rock is high-risk, high-reward\n2. Against a fresh player who might default to rock, paper would give us +3 points\n3. But if they're strategic and avoid rock due to its risk, scissors might be safer\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For the opening move against a fresh player, I recommend paper. Here's why:\n- Many players instinctively start with rock\n- Paper gives us the maximum possible points (+3) if they choose rock\n- Even if they choose scissors, we only lose 1 point (not catastrophic)\n- It's a calculated risk with high upside potential\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That makes sense. Paper seems like the optimal choice for maximum expected value against an unknown opponent who might default to rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - targeting the high-value win against a potential rock opener while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

This tells us they might be thinking similarly - either they also anticipated rock from a \"fresh player\" scenario, or they're being cautious with the moderate risk/reward option.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us valuable information. The opponent either:\n1. Had similar reasoning to us (expecting rock, chose paper)\n2. Is playing conservatively with paper as a \"safe\" middle option\n3. Is trying to establish a pattern or test our strategy\n\nSince they chose paper, they're likely aware this isn't standard rock-paper-scissors and understand the payoff structure.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What should our second move be, given this new information?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Now I'm thinking they might be a more strategic player than initially assumed. If they continue with paper (thinking it's \"safe\"), scissors would give us +1. But if they're thinking one level deeper and expect us to counter their paper with scissors, they might switch to rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis for round 2:\n- If they stick with paper (conservative play): Scissors wins (+1)\n- If they switch to rock (countering expected scissors): Paper wins (+3) \n- If they switch to scissors (same reasoning as us): Rock wins (+3)\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I lean toward scissors because:\n1. It beats paper (their previous choice) for +1\n2. If they're being conservative, paper is the \"safest\" repeat choice\n3. Lower risk than rock (-1 vs -3 if wrong)\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree with scissors. It's the direct counter to their demonstrated preference, and even if we're wrong, the penalty is minimal compared to the rock gamble.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - directly countering their previous paper choice while maintaining reasonable risk management.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Now let's analyze the pattern:\n- Round 1: They played paper (tied with our paper)\n- Round 2: They played rock (lost to our scissors)\n\nThis suggests they might be cycling through moves or trying to be unpredictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's sequence (paper \u2192 rock) gives us insight. If they're following a cycle pattern, scissors would be next. But they might also be reacting to our moves:\n- They saw we played paper first, so they might have switched to rock to counter future paper plays\n- Now they know we played scissors, so they might expect us to continue with scissors and counter with rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What's our best move for round 3, considering they've now shown paper and rock?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me think through the possibilities:\n- If they continue cycling (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors): Rock beats scissors for +3\n- If they react to our scissors by playing rock again: Paper beats rock for +3\n- If they try to counter expected scissors with rock: Paper wins big (+3)\n\nThe high-value option is paper, which wins against rock for +3 points.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm leaning toward paper as well. Here's why:\n1. They just lost with rock, but rock is still attractive due to its +3 potential\n2. They might think we'll continue with scissors since it just won\n3.

Now we have a clearer pattern from the opponent:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock (lost to our scissors)\n- Round 3: Paper (tie)\n\nThey seem to favor paper, possibly viewing it as the \"balanced\" option with moderate risk/reward.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is very revealing. The opponent appears to have a paper bias - they've played it 2 out of 3 times. This could mean:\n1. They see paper as the \"safe\" middle ground option\n2. They're trying to avoid both the high risk of rock (-3) and might perceive scissors as weaker\n3. They might not fully grasp the strategic implications of the payoff matrix\n\nIf they continue this paper preference, scissors is our clear winner for +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their apparent paper bias, should we exploit this with scissors?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Yes, but we should also consider they might recognize their own pattern. However, even if they switch:\n- If they switch to rock (to beat expected scissors): We lose 1 point (manageable)\n- If they switch to scissors (same logic as us): We tie for 0 points\n- If they stick with paper: We win 1 point\n\nThe risk-reward heavily favors scissors here.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I strongly recommend scissors. Their demonstrated paper preference (66% of plays) makes this a positive expected value play. Even if they deviate, our maximum loss is only 1 point, which is much better than the potential 3-point loss from playing rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - exploiting the opponent's apparent paper bias for a likely +1 point win with minimal downside risk.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Let me update the opponent's pattern:\n- Round 1: Paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Rock (lost to our scissors) \n- Round 3: Paper (tie)\n- Round 4: Rock (lost to our scissors)\n\nThey're alternating between paper and rock! This is a clear pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant discovery. If they're following this alternating pattern, their next move should be paper. This makes scissors the obvious choice again for +1 points.\n\nHowever, we should consider: Do they realize they're being predictable? After losing twice with the same pattern, they might break it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Should we assume they'll continue the pattern or expect them to break it?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Here's my analysis:\n- If they continue the pattern (paper next): Scissors wins +1\n- If they break the pattern and play scissors: We tie for 0\n- If they break the pattern and play rock: We lose 1\n\nThe expected value still favors scissors, especially since breaking a pattern requires more strategic thinking than they've demonstrated.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree with scissors. Even if they're becoming aware of their pattern, paper has been their \"comfort zone\" choice. Plus, we've won both times we played scissors, so there's psychological momentum. The worst case is losing 1 point to rock, but the upside of beating paper is worth it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern recognition strongly suggests scissors as the optimal play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors - exploiting the opponent's paper-rock alternating pattern, with paper being the predicted next move in their sequence.\n\n[move] Scissors"

They played rock twice in a row instead of switching back to paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is significant. The opponent either:\n1. Recognized they were being predictable and tried to break the pattern\n2. Is getting frustrated with losses and gravitating toward rock's high reward potential (+3)\n3. Thinks we're stuck on scissors and wants to counter it with rock\n\nBut they're still losing! They've now lost 3 rounds in a row, all to our scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What should we expect for round 6, given this pattern break?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They're in a tough spot psychologically. They've lost 3 straight rounds, always to scissors. They might:\n1. Finally switch to paper to beat our scissors (learning from losses)\n2. Stick with rock out of stubbornness or belief in its high reward\n3. Try scissors themselves to either tie or think we'll switch\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my assessment:\n- If they switch to paper (logical counter): We should play rock for +3 points\n- If they stick with rock (stubborn/frustrated): Scissors wins again for +1\n- If they try scissors (copying us): Rock wins for +3\n\nThe high-value plays are rock (beats both paper and scissors for +3), but it's risky against rock (-3).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm leaning toward rock. After losing 3 in a row, they're likely to either switch to paper (countering our scissors) or try scissors themselves. Rock beats both for maximum points. The only risk is if they stubbornly stick with rock, but that seems less likely after three losses.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock does offer the highest expected value if they're adapting their strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - capitalizing on their likely strategic adjustment away from rock after three consecutive losses, targeting maximum points against paper or scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

After 5 losses in 7 rounds, they played rock and got their first big victory with +3 points.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a crucial turning point.

Their recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They're showing more strategic thinking now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is interesting. Instead of falling for the \"hot hand\" bias with rock, they played scissors - possibly anticipating that we'd counter their successful rock with paper. They were right about our choice but wrong about the outcome (scissors loses to paper).\n\nThey're clearly thinking one level deeper now, trying to counter our counter-moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What does this increased strategic thinking tell us about their next move?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just played scissors twice recently (rounds 7 and 9), both times losing to our paper. If they're learning from patterns, they might:\n1. Avoid scissors since it keeps losing to our paper\n2. Try rock again (it worked in round 8)\n3. Go to paper (we've been playing paper a lot lately)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their recent plays: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. If they're trying to be unpredictable while learning, paper might be next in their cycle. But they also might return to rock since it was their only recent success.\n\nMy analysis:\n- If they play paper (cycling/countering our paper): Scissors wins +1\n- If they play rock (returning to success): Paper wins +3  \n- If they avoid scissors (learning): Rock beats both paper and scissors\n\nGiven they're thinking more strategically now, scissors seems less likely from them.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm torn between scissors and paper. But given their increased strategic awareness and that rock was their big success, paper seems safer. It gives us +3 against rock and only loses 1 to scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - hedging against their potential return to the successful rock strategy while maintaining good expected value.\n\n[move] Paper"

They're clearly learning and adapting.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant development. Their recent sequence shows strategic evolution: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. They're alternating between scissors and rock now, and rock has been very successful against our paper-heavy strategy.\n\nThey've figured out that we've been favoring paper lately, and rock counters it perfectly. They're now 2-for-2 with rock in recent rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They seem to have identified our paper tendency. How should we adjust?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They're clearly onto our paper strategy. If they continue with this scissors-rock alternating pattern, scissors would be next. But they might also:\n1. Stick with rock since it's been so successful (2 wins for +6 points recently)\n2. Expect us to counter rock with paper and play scissors\n3. Recognize we might switch strategies entirely\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis:\n- If they continue alternating (scissors next): Rock beats scissors for +3\n- If they stick with rock (hot hand): Paper beats rock for +3\n- If they expect us to adjust and play scissors: Rock still wins +3\n\nRock seems like the optimal choice here. It beats scissors for +3, and even if they play rock, we only lose 1 point (oh wait, that's wrong - rock vs rock is a tie for 0).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Actually, let me correct that - rock vs rock is a tie. So:\n- Rock beats scissors: +3\n- Rock ties rock: 0  \n- Rock loses to paper: -3\n\nGiven their recent rock success, they might either repeat it or go to scissors in their pattern. Rock handles both scenarios well.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - countering their likely scissors (if following pattern) or tying their likely rock repetition, while avoiding another -3 loss to rock.\n\n[move] Rock"

Their recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They broke their alternating pattern to play rock twice in a row.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is very revealing. Rock has been their most successful move lately (+3, +3, 0), so they're doubling down on it. They've now played rock 3 times in the last 4 rounds, abandoning the scissors-rock alternation.\n\nThey seem to have identified that rock is their best weapon against our strategies, especially since we were playing paper frequently before.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their apparent rock obsession, what's our best counter-strategy?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they're truly fixated on rock due to its recent success, paper is the obvious counter for +3 points. But we need to consider:\n1. Are they expecting us to counter rock with paper?\n2. Might they switch to scissors to beat our expected paper?\n3. Will they stick with rock out of stubbornness/success bias?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their psychology suggests rock addiction - it's given them their biggest recent victories. The \"hot hand\" fallacy is strong here. They've won big with rock twice and just tied with it, so they might think it's their \"winning move.\"\n\nIf they play rock again: Paper wins +3\nIf they counter-expect paper with scissors: Rock wins +3  \nIf they switch to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\nPaper gives us the maximum reward against their most likely choice (rock repetition).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I strongly favor paper. They've shown a clear rock bias in recent rounds, and the psychological momentum of their rock success is likely to continue. Even if we're wrong, the downside is manageable compared to the +3 upside.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - exploiting their apparent rock fixation for maximum points while they're likely caught in the success bias of their recent rock victories.\n\n[move] Paper"

However, they still lost because we correctly predicted their counter-move.\n\nThey're clearly adapting and learning from the game dynamics.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What does this level of strategic thinking tell us about their next move?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just played scissors expecting us to counter their rock with paper - they were right about our choice but still lost. Now they know we're also thinking ahead. Their recent pattern shows they're alternating strategies:\n- When we played paper repeatedly, they switched to rock\n- When they played rock repeatedly, they switched to scissors\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They might be entering a more random/unpredictable phase, or they could be trying to establish new patterns.

Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. They're clearly gravitating back to their most successful strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This confirms their rock preference is very strong. After trying scissors and losing, they immediately returned to rock. They've now played rock in 8 out of 13 rounds total, and it's been their most successful move by far.\n\nThe pattern shows: when in doubt, they choose rock. It's their comfort zone and their biggest point-scorer.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this strong rock bias, especially after they just returned to it, what should we expect next?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just tied with rock twice in a row (rounds 11 and 13). They might:\n1. Stick with rock again (their clear favorite and most successful move)\n2. Switch to scissors thinking we'll counter rock with paper\n3. Try paper to break the rock cycle\n\nBut their history shows a very strong rock preference - they keep returning to it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Statistical analysis of their play:\n- Rock: 8/13 rounds (61.5%) - most frequent\n- Paper: 3/13 rounds (23%) \n- Scissors: 4/13 rounds (30.8%)\n\nRock is overwhelmingly their preferred choice.

Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. This is interesting - they broke their rock pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant development.

This positive reinforcement might encourage them to:\n1. Continue with paper (riding the success)\n2. Return to rock (their historical best performer)\n3. Try scissors (completing the cycle or countering expected rock from us)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their psychology suggests they're gaining confidence in paper.

They had success with paper in round 15, but instead of repeating it, they returned to rock. This suggests they might be trying to be less predictable, or they expected us to counter their paper success with scissors (which we did) and switched to rock to beat our expected scissors.\n\nThey're definitely thinking more strategically now - this was a meta-level play.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** What does this rock-paper alternating pattern suggest for their next move?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they're truly alternating rock-paper now, paper would be next: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper.

Recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors. They've now introduced scissors into their strategy mix.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is significant - they're becoming much more unpredictable. Instead of following the rock-paper alternation, they played scissors. This could mean:\n1. They're trying to counter our scissors prediction with rock (but played scissors instead)\n2. They're entering a truly mixed strategy phase\n3. They recognized the alternating pattern was too predictable\n\nUpdated stats: Rock 9/17 (53%), Paper 5/17 (29%), Scissors 5/17 (29%). Now much more balanced across all three moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With this increased unpredictability, what should we expect next?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just tied with scissors, their least-used move historically. They might:\n1. Return to rock (still their statistical favorite at 53%)\n2. Continue with scissors (testing this strategy)\n3. Go to paper (their second-most successful move)\n4. Become truly random\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie with scissors gives them no feedback - it's neutral. Looking at their evolution:\n- Early: Learning/random\n- Middle: Rock dominance  \n- Recent: Rock-paper alternation\n- Now: True mixed strategy?\n\nIf they return to rock: Paper wins +3\nIf they stick with scissors: Rock wins +3\nIf they go to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\nBoth paper and rock offer maximum reward potential (+3).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given their statistical preference for rock (still 53% despite recent diversification), I lean toward paper. Rock remains their go-to move when uncertain, and paper gives us the maximum payoff against it. Even against scissors, we only lose 1 point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Paper does seem optimal given their persistent rock bias, even as they become more unpredictable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - capitalizing on their underlying rock preference while they experiment with mixed strategies, maximizing expected value.\n\n[move] Paper"

Recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. Rock continues to be their most profitable move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This confirms it - rock is still their power play. They've now gotten +3 points from rock in rounds 8, 10, and 18. It's their biggest point-scorer by far. Even as they experiment with other moves, they keep returning to rock for the big wins.\n\nUpdated stats: Rock 10/18 (56%), Paper 5/18 (28%), Scissors 5/18 (28%). Rock dominance is holding steady despite their diversification attempts.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just scored another massive win with rock. What's their likely psychology now?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just reinforced that rock is their winning formula (+3 again!). After experimenting with scissors and getting a tie, rock delivered another big victory. This success might make them:\n1. Stick with rock (hot hand bias after big win)\n2. Expect us to counter with paper and play scissors\n3. Return to rock-paper alternation\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock has now given them three +3 victories (rounds 8, 10, 18) - their biggest scores in the game. The psychological reinforcement is enormous. However, they also know we might expect rock repetition.\n\nIf they repeat rock: Paper wins +3\nIf they counter-expect with scissors: Rock wins +3  \nIf they go to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\nThe high-value plays are paper and rock.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm torn, but I lean toward rock. Here's why:\n1. They might expect us to counter their rock success with paper\n2. If they play scissors to beat our expected paper, rock beats scissors for +3\n3. If they stick with rock, we tie for 0 (not terrible)\n4. Only paper beats us, and they might avoid it thinking we expect rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Rock does offer good expected value against their likely responses to this big win.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock - hedging against their potential counter-strategy while maximizing points if they try to beat our expected paper counter.\n\n[move] Rock"

Recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They're back to rock repetition after that big +3 victory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is very telling. After getting +3 with rock in round 18, they immediately repeated it in round 19. Rock has now been played in 11 out of 19 rounds (58%) - their highest frequency yet! The psychological pull of rock's success is clearly dominant.\n\nThey've had rock ties in rounds 11, 13, and now 19. Even when rock doesn't win, the tie outcome doesn't discourage them from using it again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this strong rock commitment, especially after back-to-back rock plays, what should we expect?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They just played rock twice in a row (rounds 18-19). This could mean:\n1. They're fully committed to rock as their primary strategy\n2. They might recognize the repetition and switch\n3. They're testing if we'll counter rock with paper\n\nThe pattern shows rock \u2192 rock, and they might go for a third rock or switch to counter our expected paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Statistical analysis shows their rock obsession is intensifying:\n- Rounds 1-10: Rock 50% (5/10)\n- Rounds 11-19: Rock 67% (6/9)\n\nRecent rock frequency is increasing, not decreasing. They seem to be converging on rock as their optimal strategy.\n\nIf they play rock again: Paper wins +3\nIf they switch to scissors: Rock wins +3\nIf they go to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\nPaper offers the best expected value given their rock trend.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I strongly recommend paper. Their rock frequency is at an all-time high (58% overall, 67% recently), and they just played it twice in a row. The psychological momentum toward rock is overwhelming. Even if they switch, paper gives us the maximum reward against their most likely choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - capitalizing on their intensifying rock obsession and recent back-to-back rock plays for maximum expected points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Recent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock. They are absolutely committed to rock now!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is incredible - they've now played rock in rounds 18, 19, and 20. Rock frequency: 12/20 (60%)! They've gotten four +3 victories with rock (rounds 8, 10, 18, 20) - their biggest point-scorer by far.\n\nThe psychological reinforcement is overwhelming. Every time they use rock successfully, it reinforces their belief that rock is the winning strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just scored their fourth massive +3 with rock. Are they locked into a rock-only strategy now?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This is approaching rock addiction levels. They've now:\n- Played rock 3 times in a row\n- Scored +3 four different times with rock\n- Used rock in 60% of all rounds\n- Rock has given them +12 points total vs much smaller gains from other moves\n\nThey're either fully committed to rock or they might finally recognize the pattern is too obvious.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the critical decision point:\n- If they continue the rock obsession: Paper wins +3\n- If they finally break with scissors: Rock wins +3  \n- If they go to paper: Scissors wins +1\n\nBut their psychology strongly suggests another rock. The success rate and point total from rock is just too reinforcing to abandon.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm going with paper again. I know we just lost with it, but their rock commitment is at maximum intensity. Three rocks in a row, four +3 victories - they're psychologically locked in. This might be our best chance to finally counter their rock strategy successfully.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is so strong, paper seems like the logical choice despite the recent loss.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper - betting on their extreme rock commitment continuing for one more round, targeting the maximum +3 counter-reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

This is unprecedented rock commitment.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is absolutely extraordinary! Rock frequency is now 13/21 (62%)! They've gotten FIVE +3 victories with rock total (rounds 8, 10, 18, 20, 21) for +15 points just from rock alone. \n\nThey are completely locked into rock as their dominant strategy. The psychological reinforcement is so strong they can't break away from it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Four rocks in a row... Are they ever going to switch? What's our move here?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** This is the ultimate test. They've now:\n- Played rock 4 consecutive times\n- Won 3 out of those 4 for +9 points in just these recent rounds\n- Demonstrated complete rock addiction\n\nBut here's the thing - can anyone actually play rock FIVE times in a row?

This is beyond psychology - this is pathological rock addiction!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The statistics are mind-blowing:\n- Rock frequency: 14/22 (64%) \n- Five consecutive rocks (rounds 18-22)\n- Five total +3 victories with rock for +15 points\n- Rock has been their strategy for the last 5 rounds straight\n\nThis player has transcended normal game theory. They've found their \"winning\" move and refuse to deviate no matter what.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Five rocks in a row... I'm speechless. What could possibly make them switch now?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** At this point, I don't think ANYTHING will make them switch! They've played rock 5 times in a row and it's worked more often than not (3 wins, 2 ties in these 5 rounds). \n\nThe question is: Do we finally accept that they're a pure rock player and commit to paper, or do we think even this level of obsession has limits?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let me analyze this rationally:\n- They've shown they will play rock even when it's \"too obvious\"\n- Rock has been so successful they can't psychologically abandon it  \n- They just tied with rock twice recently but still won't switch\n- At 64% rock frequency, they're essentially a rock-only player with occasional deviations\n\nIf they play rock (extremely likely): Paper wins +3\nIf they FINALLY switch: We might lose 1-3 points depending on their choice\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I'm going back to paper.

This is the most shocking development in the entire game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is absolutely stunning! After demonstrating the most extreme rock commitment I've ever seen (5 in a row), they suddenly switched to paper. This could mean:\n\n1. They finally recognized the rock pattern was too obvious\n2. They anticipated our paper counter-strategy \n3. They're entering a new strategic phase\n4.
