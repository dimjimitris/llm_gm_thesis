    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-move tendencies.\n\nMany new players tend to start with Rock (it's often the most intuitive first choice), so playing Paper would counter that and give me the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Both times (rounds 16 and 22) they lured me into expecting Scissors with repeated plays, then switched to Rock when I played Paper to counter it.\n\nThis opponent is extremely sophisticated - they're willing to lose several small battles to win big ones. After getting the -3 penalty on me, they might:\n\n1. Expect me to play Scissors (to counter Rock)\n2. Continue with Rock (if they think it's working)\n3. Switch back to their Scissors pattern\n\nGiven that they just successfully executed their trap again, they might expect me to counter with Scissors. If so, they could play Paper to beat my expected Scissors.\n\nBut they might also think I've learned their pattern and expect something else entirely.\n\nThis is a highly strategic opponent who thinks several moves ahead. I need to avoid being predictable. Since they might expect Scissors from me (to counter their Rock), and they might play Paper to counter that, I should consider Rock.\n\nRock gives me +3 if they play Paper, ties if they play Rock, and only loses -1 to Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

They're operating on multiple psychological levels:\n1. Create Scissors patterns to bait Paper responses\n2. Switch to Rock for maximum damage (-3)\n3. Predict my counter-responses and stay ahead\n\nAfter successfully countering my Rock with Scissors, they might expect me to:\n1. Play Paper (to counter expected Scissors)\n2. Try something unpredictable\n3. Get frustrated and make random moves\n\nThe key insight is that they're reading my psychology, not just my patterns. They know I'm trying to counter-think them, so they're counter-thinking my counter-thinking.\n\nAt this level of meta-gaming, maybe the best approach is to actually be somewhat random or go with a simple strategy. They might be over-thinking what I'll do.\n\nSince they just played Scissors and have been alternating between their trap moves, they might expect me to play Paper to counter Scissors. If they expect Paper from me, they might play Rock again.\n\nBut maybe I should just play what beats their most recent move without overthinking it. They played Scissors, so Paper beats Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"
