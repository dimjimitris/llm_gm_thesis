Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1). Against a \"fresh player\" with no history, we need to consider what they're most likely to choose.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors tend to have predictable patterns:\n1. Rock is the most common first move (about 35-40% of players choose it)\n2. Paper is second most common (about 30-35%)\n3. Scissors is least common first move (about 25-30%)\n\nGiven that rock is most likely, and rock beats paper with a high payoff, the fresh player might avoid paper. But they also might not fully understand the modified scoring system yet.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on your analysis, if the opponent is most likely to choose rock, I should choose scissors to beat it and get +1 point while they get -1. However, the risk is lower compared to choosing paper (which would lose -3 to their rock). What do you think about this reasoning?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Your reasoning is sound. If we estimate a 35-40% chance they choose rock, scissors gives us a positive expected value against that. Even if they choose paper (our scissors lose), we only lose -1, not -3. The expected value calculation favors scissors against a rock-heavy fresh player.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. Scissors is the safer play against a fresh opponent likely to choose rock. It's also worth noting that many players avoid scissors as a first move because it \"feels\" weaker, so they won't expect it from us.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Choose scissors - it beats the most likely opponent choice (rock) while minimizing risk compared to other options.\n\n[move] Scissors - reasoning that a fresh player is most likely to choose rock, and scissors beats rock with favorable risk/reward ratio",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nNotice that Rock has asymmetric payoffs - it gives +3/-3 instead of +1/-1. This makes Rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, we need to consider what a new player might do. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose Rock first (it's psychologically aggressive)\n2. Go with Paper (it's the \"safe\" middle option)\n3. Pick randomly\n\nGiven the payoff structure, if we expect them to play Rock (common first move), we should play Paper to get +1. If we expect Paper, we should play Scissors for +1. If we expect Scissors, we should play Rock for +3.\n\n**AI Assistant:** The asymmetric payoffs are key here. Rock gives the biggest reward (+3) but also the biggest penalty (-3). Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I'm thinking they might go with Rock as an aggressive opener, which is common in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! And if they do play Rock and we play Paper, we get +1 points. It's a safer strategy than trying to guess if they'll play Scissors (which would make Rock our best choice for +3, but risky if they play Paper instead).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I recommend Paper. It beats Rock (which fresh players often choose first), gives us a decent +1 reward, and if we're wrong and they play Scissors, we only lose -1 rather than the -3 we'd face if we played Rock and they played Paper.\n\n**AI Assistant:** Agreed. Paper seems like the optimal first move given the opponent is fresh and the payoff structure favors a cautious but strategic approach.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper - it counters the most likely first move (Rock) from a fresh player while avoiding the high-risk scenario.\n\n[move] Paper",

Fresh players often:\n1. Default to rock (most common first choice)\n2. Choose randomly\n3. Pick what seems \"strongest\" \n\nGiven that rock has the highest payoff, many players might gravitate toward it initially.

However, if they play rock (likely for a fresh player), scissors wins me +1 point. The expected value seems reasonable.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly. Against an unknown opponent, scissors seems like a solid opening move because:\n- It beats the most commonly chosen opening move (rock)\n- Even if we lose, we only lose 1 point (not 3 like with rock)\n- It's a relatively safe play with decent upside\n\nStrategic Analyst: I agree.

This creates an interesting asymmetric game where Rock is high-risk, high-reward.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know our tendencies yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors often:\n1. Start with Rock (most common first move)\n2. Go with what feels \"strong\" \n3. Haven't developed counter-strategies yet\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given the payoff structure, if we expect the opponent to play Rock (common for new players), we should play Paper to get the maximum +3 points. Even if we're wrong, our worst case scenarios are:\n- If they play Paper: tie (0 points)\n- If they play Scissors: we lose 1 point\n- If they play Rock: we win 3 points\n\nThe expected value favors Paper if there's any reasonable chance they'll play Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Paper dominates in expected value against a random or Rock-biased opponent. The 3-point swing makes it worth the risk.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on our analysis, Paper seems optimal for the first move against a fresh player. The high reward for beating Rock (their likely choice) outweighs the modest risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper - it maximizes expected value against a fresh player likely to choose Rock, with a potential +3 point reward.\n\n[move] Paper",

This is an interesting variant of rock-paper-scissors with asymmetric payoffs:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have established patterns yet. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often start with Rock due to psychological bias. However, the asymmetric payoffs change the dynamics significantly. A rational player might avoid Rock due to the high penalty risk, or they might choose Rock for the high reward potential.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that this is the first round against a fresh player, what should be our opening strategy? Should we go for the high-risk/high-reward Rock, or play more conservatively?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** For the opening move against an unknown opponent, I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. If they play the psychologically common Rock, we win big (+3 points)\n2. If they play Scissors, we lose only 1 point (minimal penalty)\n3. If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe expected value favors Paper when facing an uncertain opponent, especially if there's any bias toward Rock.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I agree with Paper as the opening move. It's the optimal choice against Rock (which fresh players often choose), and the downside against Scissors is manageable. We can observe their response and adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Excellent analysis.

This could lead them to play Paper to counter our potential Rock. However, they might also think we'll stick with Paper or try to outthink us further.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I recommend playing Rock this round. Here's the reasoning:\n1.
