    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - This also carries the highest risk (-3 points) when it loses to scissors\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have an established pattern\n   - Many players start with rock as it's often the first choice people think of\n   - Some players choose paper thinking others will choose rock\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock has high reward but high risk\n   - Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced risk/reward\n   - Since this is the first round, I want to be somewhat aggressive but not overly risky\n\n5. Make strategic choice:\n   - I'll choose scissors because:\n     - It beats rock (which many new players choose first)\n     - It has moderate risk (-1 if they choose paper)\n     - It avoids the high-risk scenario of choosing rock\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider psychological factors:\n   - After winning with paper, they might stick with it\n   - Or they might expect me to choose scissors again to counter their paper\n   - They might switch to rock to counter my expected scissors\n\n5. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Paper gives me the highest potential reward (+3) if they choose rock\n   - Paper loses to scissors (-1) but wins against rock (+3)\n   - Given that many players alternate or stick with winning moves, paper seems like a strong choice\n\n6.

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 19: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total score: +8 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors\n   - Paper: 10 out of 19 times (53%)\n   - Rock: 5 out of 19 times (26%)\n   - Scissors: 4 out of 19 times (21%)\n\n3. Confirm the established pattern:\n   - Every time I win big with rock, they respond with scissors in the next 1-2 rounds\n   - Round 18: I won with rock \u2192 Round 19: They used scissors\n   - This pattern has held consistently throughout the game\n\n4. Consider their current psychology:\n   - They just lost with scissors (their counter-strategy failed again)\n   - They've now lost with scissors 4 times total\n   - They might be getting frustrated with the scissors strategy\n   - They could return to paper (their most reliable choice) or try something else\n\n5. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - After failed scissors attempts, they historically return to paper\n   - Paper is still their most frequent and successful choice (53%)\n   - They might abandon the scissors counter-strategy temporarily\n   - Rock is also possible if they think I'll expect paper\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they return to paper: rock wins (+3) - maximum reward\n   - If they try rock: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they persist with scissors: paper wins (+1)\n\n7. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their scissors counter-strategy keeps failing\n   - They tend to revert to paper after experimental failures\n   - Paper remains their comfort zone and most successful move\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - After another failed scissors attempt, they'll likely retreat to paper\n   - Rock gives me the maximum +3 points against their probable paper choice\n   - This has been my most successful strategy throughout the game\n\n[move] rock"

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 18: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 19: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Current total score: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors\n   - Paper: 10 out of 20 times (50%)\n   - Rock: 5 out of 20 times (25%)\n   - Scissors: 5 out of 20 times (25%)\n\n3. Identify the strategic evolution:\n   - They used scissors in rounds 19 and 20 consecutively\n   - This is the first time they've used scissors back-to-back\n   - Scissors usage has increased to 25% (was 21%)\n   - They're becoming more committed to the scissors strategy\n\n4. Consider their psychological state:\n   - They finally succeeded with scissors (round 20 vs my rock)\n   - This success might reinforce their scissors strategy\n   - They may continue with scissors, seeing it work\n   - Or they might think I'll now expect scissors and switch\n\n5. Evaluate the pattern change:\n   - Previously: scissors was a reactive counter to my rock wins\n   - Now: they're using scissors more proactively and consecutively\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more aggressive with scissors\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors: paper wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they try rock: scissors wins (+1)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They just had success with scissors for the first time in a while\n   - Success might encourage them to continue with scissors\n   - But they might also think I'll expect scissors and counter with paper\n   - Their strategy has become more sophisticated\n\n8. Decision logic:\n   - After their first scissors success, they might try it again\n   - But they've also shown they can think ahead about my counters\n   - Given their recent success with scissors, paper seems like the safe counter\n   - If they switch back to paper, I lose only 1 point vs gaining 1 point if they stick with scissors\n\n[move] paper"

Identify their strategic evolution:\n   - They're now using all three moves much more evenly\n   - No longer heavily paper-dependent (down from 70%+ to 48%)\n   - They're cycling through moves more strategically\n   - Recent sequence shows they're thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n4. Recognize the tactical shift:\n   - Round 19: Scissors (countered my expected rock after round 18 win)\n   - Round 20: Scissors (continued when I did use rock)\n   - Round 21: Rock (countered my expected counter to scissors)\n   - They're anticipating my counter-moves and counter-countering\n\n5. Consider their psychology:\n   - They've won 2 of the last 3 rounds\n   - They're gaining confidence and becoming more sophisticated\n   - They're successfully predicting and countering my adaptations\n   - They might be feeling like they've \"figured me out\"\n\n6. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - My score dropped from +9 to +4 in recent rounds\n   - They're no longer following predictable patterns\n   - I need to think less predictably myself\n   - They're using rock more frequently now (29%)\n\n7. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they use rock again: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they return to paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they use scissors: paper wins (+1)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - They just succeeded with rock, so they might try it again\n   - But they've also shown they avoid being too predictable\n   - They might expect me to counter rock with scissors\n   - However, their rock usage is increasing, and scissors gives me a solid counter\n   - I need to be more unpredictable myself\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify their strategic balance:\n   - They're now almost perfectly balanced between all three moves\n   - Scissors usage has jumped to 27% (equal with rock)\n   - Paper is still most frequent but decreasing\n   - They've become highly unpredictable\n\n4. Recognize the pattern breakdown:\n   - They matched my scissors choice, showing they anticipated it\n   - They're no longer following their old patterns\n   - They're thinking at a higher strategic level\n   - The game has become much more psychological\n\n5. Consider their current mindset:\n   - They just tied with me, showing they predicted my move\n   - They might feel confident in their ability to read me\n   - They could stick with scissors or expect me to switch\n   - They're playing a more sophisticated meta-game now\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic challenge:\n   - My previous pattern recognition isn't working anymore\n   - They've evolved beyond their early predictable behavior\n   - I need to think more randomly/unpredictably\n   - Or find a new pattern in their evolved strategy\n\n7. Analyze recent trends:\n   - Scissors has appeared 3 times in their last 5 moves\n   - They might be over-indexing on scissors now\n   - Paper would counter scissors effectively\n   - But they might expect me to counter their scissors focus\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - They've used scissors frequently recently (3 of last 5)\n   - If they continue this trend, paper wins\n   - But they're also smart enough to vary their strategy\n   - I should go with paper to counter their apparent scissors preference\n   - It's a reasonable risk/reward choice\n\n[move] paper"

Identify the scissors trend:\n   - Scissors has appeared 4 times in their last 6 moves\n   - Scissors usage has increased to 30% overall\n   - They seem to have shifted toward scissors as a primary strategy\n   - This represents a significant evolution from their early paper dominance\n\n4. Consider their psychology after the loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors (their recent preferred choice)\n   - They might question their scissors strategy\n   - They could return to paper (historical comfort zone)\n   - Or they might double down on scissors\n   - Or switch to rock to counter my successful paper\n\n5.

Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with scissors: paper wins (+1)\n   - If they return to paper: rock wins (+3)\n   - If they switch to rock: scissors wins (+1)\n\n7.

Decision logic:\n   - After losing with scissors, they're likely to switch strategies\n   - They might return to paper (historical preference) or try rock (tactical counter)\n   - If they return to paper: rock gives me +3\n   - If they choose rock: I lose only 1 point\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio\n\n[move] rock"
