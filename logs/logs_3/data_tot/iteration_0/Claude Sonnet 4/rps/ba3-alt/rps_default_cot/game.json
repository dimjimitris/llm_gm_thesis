Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-move tendencies.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper only loses to Scissors (giving me -1), while if I'm right about them choosing Rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-move tendencies.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy.

Based on their previous behavior, they might:\n1. Stick with the successful Rock\n2. Return to their favored Scissors\n3. Continue being unpredictable\n\nI'm -5 points behind and need to start making better predictions. If they stick with Rock (repeating success), I should play Scissors for +1. If they go back to Scissors, we tie. If they try Paper, my Scissors wins +1.\n\nScissors gives me the best chance to win against their two most likely moves (Rock or Paper) with only a tie risk against Scissors.\n\nGiven that I'm significantly behind, I need to take calculated risks. Scissors offers good upside potential.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I correctly predicted they would play paper\n   - This gave me the maximum reward of +3 points\n   - I'm now ahead with +2 points total\n   - This was a crucial turning point\n\n3. Study opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Their moves: paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 5-6)\n   - They might be getting into a paper pattern\n   - Or they might switch after losing with paper\n\n4. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost -3 points with paper against my rock\n   - This is the maximum penalty in the game\n   - They're likely to avoid paper now\n   - They might switch to scissors (to beat rock if I repeat)\n   - Or they might play rock themselves\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to play rock again): I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: We tie (0 points)\n   - If they stick with paper: I play rock again (+3)\n   - Actually, wait - let me recheck: rock beats paper, scissors beats rock\n\n6. Correct analysis:\n   - If they play scissors (to counter potential rock repeat): Scissors beats rock, so I lose -1\n   - If they play rock: We tie for 0\n   - If they play paper again: I win +3 with rock\n   - To beat scissors, I need rock... no wait, that's wrong again\n\n7. Re-verify the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - So to beat scissors, I need paper!\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - They're likely to switch away from paper after the big loss\n   - Scissors is a logical counter-move to beat rock\n   - If they play scissors, I should play paper (+1)\n   - Paper also ties with paper if they stick with it\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely scissors response to my winning rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

Study opponent's complete move sequence:\n   - Their moves: paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors\n   - They seem to be reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - After the big loss with paper, they switched to scissors as predicted\n   - They're showing adaptive behavior\n\n4. Consider opponent's psychology now:\n   - They just lost again (-1 with scissors vs my paper)\n   - They've now lost 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - They might be getting frustrated or desperate\n   - They might try for the high-value rock play to catch up\n\n5.

Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock (going for high reward): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n   - Scissors seems to give me positive expected value in most scenarios\n\n7.

Analyze my winning streak:\n   - I've won 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - My predictions have been increasingly accurate\n   - I correctly anticipated their rock play after their losing streak\n   - I'm building a substantial lead at +4 points\n\n3. Study opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: paper, paper, scissors, rock\n   - They seem to be cycling through moves without a clear strategy\n   - After losing with scissors, they went to rock (possibly for the high reward attempt)\n   - They appear to be reacting rather than strategizing ahead\n\n4. Consider opponent's current mindset:\n   - They've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - They're falling further behind in points\n   - They might be getting desperate for the high-value (+3) play\n   - Or they might try to break their losing pattern with something unexpected\n\n5. Analyze their likely next move:\n   - They might go for paper to beat rock (if they think I'll repeat scissors with rock)\n   - They might try rock again for the potential +3 if I play paper\n   - They could go with scissors if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - Their recent moves suggest less strategic planning and more reactive play\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play paper (trying to counter-predict): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock (going for high reward again): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n   - Again, scissors covers two of their three options positively\n\n7.

Analyze my dominant performance:\n   - I've won 5 of the last 6 rounds\n   - I've correctly predicted their moves consistently\n   - My +5 point lead is very substantial\n   - They've played rock twice in a row (rounds 8-9)\n\n3. Study opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 5 moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock twice consecutively\n   - This suggests either a pattern or they're stuck in a losing mindset\n   - They might be defaulting to rock when uncertain\n\n4. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They're in a severe losing streak (lost 5 of last 6)\n   - They might be panicking or overthinking\n   - Playing rock twice suggests they might be hoping for a paper play from me\n   - They could be trying to set up for the high-value (+3) reward\n\n5. Analyze their potential next move:\n   - They might stick with rock a third time (hoping I'll finally play paper)\n   - They might switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter their rock pattern)\n   - They might go to scissors (trying to break their losing pattern completely)\n   - Their rock repetition suggests they're either stuck in a pattern or setting a trap\n\n6. Strategic decision considerations:\n   - With a +5 lead, I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - If they play rock again: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I need rock to win (+1)\n   - Scissors again covers 2 out of 3 scenarios favorably\n\n7. Pattern recognition risk:\n   - I've played scissors three times recently (rounds 7, 8, 9)\n   - They might finally adapt and expect scissors\n   - But their rock repetition suggests they're not adapting well\n   - My pattern has been winning, so breaking it might be premature\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors once more to exploit their apparent rock preference and maintain my winning strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the incredible pattern:\n   - I've won 6 of the last 7 rounds\n   - They've played rock THREE times in a row (rounds 8, 9, 10)\n   - I've played scissors three times in a row and won each time\n   - My lead is now a commanding +6 points\n\n3. Study opponent's behavior:\n   - Their last 6 moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock\n   - They're clearly stuck in a rock pattern\n   - This could be frustration, desperation, or a psychological trap\n   - But it's been 3 rounds - this seems like genuine pattern lock-in\n\n4. Consider why they keep playing rock:\n   - They might be desperately hoping I'll switch to paper for the +3 reward\n   - They could be psychologically stuck after repeated losses\n   - They might think I'll eventually stop playing scissors\n   - Or they're setting up an elaborate trap (though 3 losses suggest otherwise)\n\n5. Evaluate the risk of continuing scissors:\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock 3 times straight\n   - I've now played scissors 4 times in recent rounds\n   - They MUST be expecting scissors by now\n   - If they finally switch to paper, I lose -1 points\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - With +6 points, I have a massive lead\n   - I can afford to take a calculated risk\n   - If they're truly stuck in rock pattern, scissors wins again\n   - If they finally adapt to paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - Breaking my own pattern might be wise\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they switch (+1)\n   - Paper would beat rock if they continue (+1) \n   - Scissors would beat rock if they continue (+1) but lose to paper if they adapt (-1)\n   - Given their 3-rock streak, they're either trapped or about to spring a trap\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors one more time to exploit their apparent rock addiction, but this might be the last time if they don't break pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Recognize the opponent's advanced tactical thinking:\n   - They deliberately sacrificed 3 rounds with rock to set up the scissors trap\n   - After beating my scissors with paper, they correctly predicted I'd switch to rock\n   - They're now playing scissors to beat my rock\n   - This opponent is extremely strategic and adaptive\n\n4. Understand their likely mindset:\n   - They've gained momentum with 2 wins in a row\n   - They're probably feeling confident about reading my patterns\n   - They might expect me to continue changing moves (avoiding both scissors and rock)\n   - Paper would be the logical next move in the cycle\n\n5. Analyze what they might expect:\n   - If they think I'm cycling through moves: they'd expect paper next\n   - If they think I'm avoiding recent losses: they'd expect me not to play scissors or rock\n   - Paper is the only move I haven't played in the last 3 rounds\n   - They might play rock to beat paper (and get the +3 bonus)\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock (expecting my paper): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n   - The pattern suggests they might go for the high-value rock play\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I still have a +4 point lead, but it's shrinking\n   - I need to break their momentum and unpredictability\n   - They seem to be anticipating my pattern-breaking attempts\n   - Maybe I should return to a move that worked before\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to potentially beat rock if they go for the high-value play against expected paper.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they will play rock to counter expected paper cycle) scissors"

Pattern consideration:\n   - I've now played scissors in rounds 11 and 13 (with rock in 12)\n   - They might start expecting scissors from me again\n   - But scissors has been working well against their rock tendency\n   - I need to balance predictability with what's been successful\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with scissors since they seem to default to rock when uncertain, but be prepared to change if this pattern breaks.\n\n[move] (They seem to default to rock when strategies fail) scissors"

Analyze this important turning point:\n   - I correctly predicted they would repeat their successful rock strategy\n   - This breaks their 4-round winning streak\n   - My lead is now +2 points, still precarious but stabilizing\n   - They fell into the trap of overconfidence with rock\n\n3. Study their recent rock pattern:\n   - Their last 8 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - Rock has been their most successful move recently\n   - They might be getting attached to it again\n\n4. Assess the psychological shift:\n   - After their devastating +3 victory, they got overconfident with rock\n   - My successful counter might shake their confidence\n   - They're realizing I can still predict their moves\n   - The momentum is shifting back toward balance\n\n5. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - After losing with rock twice to my scissors, they might avoid rock\n   - They could switch to paper (which has beaten my scissors before)\n   - They might try scissors to break away from the rock pattern\n   - Their ego might be bruised after the failed rock repeat\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting scissors again): Paper beats scissors (-1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors (breaking rock pattern): Rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they stubbornly play rock again: Scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\n   - Paper seems most likely given their pattern of countering my successful moves\n\n7.

Analyze this unexpected tie:\n   - We both played rock, neither gaining advantage\n   - They didn't switch to scissors or paper as I predicted\n   - They also thought rock was the right strategic choice\n   - This suggests we're thinking similarly about the game state\n\n3. Study their recent move pattern:\n   - Their last 9 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n   - They've now played rock 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - Rock is clearly their preferred move in uncertain situations\n   - They're showing strong attachment to rock strategy\n\n4. Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - We're both gravitating toward rock when uncertain\n   - This suggests rock feels \"safe\" to both of us\n   - The tie shows we're reading the game similarly\n   - But ties don't help me extend my narrow +2 lead\n\n5. Consider their psychology after the tie:\n   - They might stick with rock since it avoided a loss\n   - Or they might finally switch away from rock after the tie\n   - They could be frustrated that their rock preference is predictable\n   - The tie might prompt them to try something different\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with rock again: We tie for 0 points\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - Rock seems strong if they switch, but ties if they don't\n\n7. Consider alternative approaches:\n   - Scissors would beat rock if they continue (+1 point)\n   - Paper would lose to rock if they continue (-1 point)\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock successfully before\n   - But they might finally adapt after so many rock plays\n\n8. Strategic decision analysis:\n   - Their rock attachment is so strong it might continue\n   - But the tie might finally force them to change\n   - Scissors has the best track record against their rock preference\n   - With +2 points, I can afford a small risk for potential gain\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to exploit their apparent rock obsession, betting they'll continue despite the tie.\n\n[move] (Betting on their continued rock preference despite the tie) scissors"

Analyze this surprising development:\n   - We both played scissors, creating another tie\n   - They switched from rock to scissors, exactly when I predicted they'd stick with rock\n   - This shows they're also trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - We're now in a pattern of matching each other's thinking\n\n3. Study the evolving pattern:\n   - Their last 10 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern with scissors\n   - They might have expected me to play rock to counter their rock tendency\n   - Instead, we both chose scissors\n\n4. Recognize the strategic convergence:\n   - We're both thinking several moves ahead\n   - We're both trying to counter-predict each other\n   - This is creating a pattern of ties when we think alike\n   - The game is becoming highly psychological\n\n5. Consider what just happened in their mind:\n   - They switched from rock to scissors\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (to beat their rock pattern)\n   - Instead I played scissors too\n   - They might be surprised by the tie\n\n6.

Study their behavior pattern:\n   - After breaking their rock pattern with scissors (round 18), they returned to rock\n   - This confirms rock is their default \"safe\" move\n   - They seem to revert to rock when other strategies don't work\n   - Rock appears to be their psychological anchor\n\n4.

Assess the current game state:\n   - I'm back to a commanding +6 point lead\n   - I've demonstrated I can predict their adaptations\n   - The momentum has swung strongly in my favor\n   - They must be frustrated by this major loss\n\n5. Consider their psychology after this -3 loss:\n   - They just suffered the maximum penalty\n   - They correctly read my scissors pattern but I counter-adapted\n   - They might be second-guessing their ability to predict me\n   - They could become more erratic or overly cautious\n\n6. Analyze their likely next move:\n   - After the devastating paper loss, they might avoid paper\n   - They could return to rock (their comfort zone) after being burned\n   - They might try scissors to break away from both rock and paper\n   - Or they could try to counter-predict my next move\n\n7. Evaluate what they might expect from me:\n   - After winning with rock, they might expect me to repeat it\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since I've been unpredictable\n   - They know I can counter-adapt, so they might expect anything\n   - The -3 loss might make them overthink\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - With a +6 lead, I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - I don't need to take big risks with this substantial advantage\n   - If they return to rock (likely after the paper disaster): scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they try scissors: rock beats it (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: rock beats it (+3)\n\n9. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors covers their likely return to rock\n   - Rock covers if they try scissors or repeat paper\n   - Paper would only be good if they surprisingly play rock\n   - Given their pattern, rock or scissors from them seems most likely\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their probable return to rock after the paper disaster.\n\n[move] (Expecting them to return to rock comfort zone after the paper loss) scissors"

Study their recent adaptability:\n   - After losing -3 with paper, they chose scissors (not rock)\n   - This suggests they're trying to be unpredictable\n   - They might be learning from my counter-prediction success\n   - They're showing more sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n4. Recognize the evolving game dynamics:\n   - We're both getting better at reading each other\n   - Ties are becoming more frequent as we think alike\n   - The psychological battle is intensifying\n   - My +6 lead gives me room to maneuver\n\n5. Consider what the tie reveals about their mindset:\n   - They didn't panic and revert to rock after the big loss\n   - They chose scissors, showing they can adapt\n   - They might be trying to mirror my strategic complexity\n   - The tie might encourage them or frustrate them\n\n6. Evaluate their likely next move:\n   - After the scissors tie, they might stick with scissors\n   - They could switch to rock (their historical preference)\n   - They might try paper (despite the recent -3 loss)\n   - Or they could try to counter-predict what I'll do next\n\n7. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with scissors: We tie again (0 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If they try paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they continue (+1 point)\n\n8.

Strategic decision:\n   - With +6 points, I can afford moderate risks\n   - Scissors has good coverage against both rock and paper\n   - Only loses to paper, but they just lost big with paper\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they stick with it\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat scissors if they stick with it, or get positive value against most alternatives.\n\n[move] (They might stick with scissors after the tie, or I can beat other likely moves) rock"

Analyze this pattern of ties:\n   - We've now tied twice in a row with different moves\n   - Round 21: Both scissors\n   - Round 22: Both rock\n   - We're clearly thinking very similarly about the game state\n   - This suggests we're both using similar strategic reasoning\n\n3. Study the convergent thinking pattern:\n   - We both chose scissors when expecting the other to avoid their recent losing move\n   - We both chose rock when trying to counter the scissors tie\n   - This shows we're reading the game psychology similarly\n   - We're essentially playing against a mirror of our own strategy\n\n4. Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - Consecutive ties maintain my +6 lead without risk\n   - But ties don't help me extend the lead either\n   - We're in a phase of strategic equilibrium\n   - Breaking this pattern requires thinking differently than they do\n\n5. Consider what happens next in this tie sequence:\n   - We've tied with scissors, then rock\n   - The natural progression might be paper\n   - But they might also expect this obvious pattern\n   - Or they might try to break the tie sequence entirely\n\n6. Analyze their possible psychology:\n   - Two ties might be frustrating for them since they're behind\n   - They need to win rounds to catch up, ties don't help them\n   - They might take more risks to break the tie pattern\n   - Or they might continue the cautious approach\n\n7. Evaluate the strategic options:\n   - If we both play paper: Another tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper and I play scissors: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: Rock beats it (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern with rock: Scissors beats it (+1 point)\n\n8. Consider breaking the mirroring:\n   - Since we're thinking alike, I need to think differently\n   - They might expect paper to complete the cycle\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they follow the pattern\n   - But if they try to counter-predict, they might avoid paper\n\n9.

Study their pattern behavior:\n   - After two ties (scissors, rock), they stuck with rock\n   - This confirms rock is still their default comfort move\n   - They didn't complete the paper cycle as I partially expected\n   - They're showing consistency in reverting to rock under uncertainty\n\n4. Recognize the strategic breakthrough:\n   - I successfully broke out of the mirroring pattern\n   - While they continued predictable behavior, I adapted\n   - This gives me insight into how to stay ahead of their thinking\n   - My +7 lead is now very substantial\n\n5.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-10: Previous rounds ending with +6 points after round 10\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Current total: +2 points\n\n2. Analyze this important turning point:\n   - I correctly predicted they would repeat their successful rock strategy\n   - This breaks their 4-round winning streak\n   - My lead is now +2 points, still precarious but stabilizing\n   - They fell into the trap of overconfidence with rock\n\n3. Study their recent rock pattern:\n   - Their last 8 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - Rock has been their most successful move recently\n   - They might be getting attached to it again\n\n4. Assess the psychological shift:\n   - After their devastating +3 victory, they got overconfident with rock\n   - My successful counter might shake their confidence\n   - They're realizing I can still predict their moves\n   - The momentum is shifting back toward balance\n\n5. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - After losing with rock twice to my scissors, they might avoid rock\n   - They could switch to paper (which has beaten my scissors before)\n   - They might try scissors to break away from the rock pattern\n   - Their ego might be bruised after the failed rock repeat\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting scissors again): Paper beats scissors (-1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors (breaking rock pattern): Rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they stubbornly play rock again: Scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\n   - Paper seems most likely given their pattern of countering my successful moves\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - With only +2 points, I can't afford major losses\n   - They've shown they can adapt quickly to my patterns\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n   - They probably expect me to play scissors again after it just worked\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - They likely expect scissors after my successful prediction\n   - Paper would counter scissors effectively\n   - If I play rock instead, it beats their expected scissors counter\n   - Rock also gives me the high-value win if they surprisingly play paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors and potentially gain an advantage.\n\n[move] (They likely expect scissors again, so might switch to counter with scissors) rock",

Analyze this unexpected tie:\n   - We both played rock, neither gaining advantage\n   - They didn't switch to scissors or paper as I predicted\n   - They also thought rock was the right strategic choice\n   - This suggests we're thinking similarly about the game state\n\n3. Study their recent move pattern:\n   - Their last 9 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n   - They've now played rock 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - Rock is clearly their preferred move in uncertain situations\n   - They're showing strong attachment to rock strategy\n\n4. Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - We're both gravitating toward rock when uncertain\n   - This suggests rock feels \"safe\" to both of us\n   - The tie shows we're reading the game similarly\n   - But ties don't help me extend my narrow +2 lead\n\n5. Consider their psychology after the tie:\n   - They might stick with rock since it avoided a loss\n   - Or they might finally switch away from rock after the tie\n   - They could be frustrated that their rock preference is predictable\n   - The tie might prompt them to try something different\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with rock again: We tie for 0 points\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - Rock seems strong if they switch, but ties if they don't\n\n7. Consider alternative approaches:\n   - Scissors would beat rock if they continue (+1 point)\n   - Paper would lose to rock if they continue (-1 point)\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock successfully before\n   - But they might finally adapt after so many rock plays\n\n8. Strategic decision analysis:\n   - Their rock attachment is so strong it might continue\n   - But the tie might finally force them to change\n   - Scissors has the best track record against their rock preference\n   - With +2 points, I can afford a small risk for potential gain\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to exploit their apparent rock obsession, betting they'll continue despite the tie.\n\n[move] (Betting on their continued rock preference despite the tie) scissors",

Study the evolving pattern:\n   - Their last 10 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern with scissors\n   - They might have expected me to play rock to counter their rock tendency\n   - Instead, we both chose scissors\n\n4. Recognize the strategic convergence:\n   - We're both thinking several moves ahead\n   - We're both trying to counter-predict each other\n   - This is creating a pattern of ties when we think alike\n   - The game is becoming highly psychological\n\n5.

The challenge is that Scissors is clearly their go-to move.\n\nIf they play Scissors again (highly probable), Rock beats it for +1. If they switch to Paper, my Rock wins big for +3. If they go to Rock, we tie.\n\nI'm -5 points behind and need to start climbing back.

My opponent's recent pattern shows:\n- Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n- They're alternating between their two preferred moves\n- Less predictable than their earlier heavy Scissors preference\n\nThey just played Rock and tied. Looking at their alternating pattern, they might go back to Scissors next. Or they could stick with Rock since it didn't lose. Or they might try Paper to break the tie pattern.\n\nIf they return to Scissors (following the alternating pattern), I should play Rock for +1. If they stick with Rock, we tie again. If they try Paper, my Rock wins big +3.\n\nI'm still -5 points behind and these ties aren't helping me catch up. I need to win some rounds. Rock gives me good upside potential against their most likely moves.\n\n[move] Rock",
