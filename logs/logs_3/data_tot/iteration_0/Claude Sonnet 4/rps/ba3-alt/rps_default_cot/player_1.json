    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The penalty for rock losing is also highest (-3 points) when paper beats rock\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns\n   - Fresh players often start with rock (most common first move in rock-paper-scissors)\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper to get +3 points\n\n4. Risk vs reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: +3 if opponent plays rock, -1 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if tie\n   - Playing rock: +3 if opponent plays paper, -1 if opponent plays scissors, 0 if tie  \n   - Playing scissors: +1 if opponent plays rock, -1 if opponent plays paper, 0 if tie\n\n5. Optimal strategy for first move:\n   - Since fresh players commonly start with rock, paper maximizes my expected value\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is only -1 (vs scissors), not -3\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock opening from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Consider what this reveals:\n   - The opponent is not following the typical \"fresh player plays rock first\" pattern\n   - They might be more strategic than initially assumed\n   - They could be trying to counter-predict my moves\n\n3. Analyze possible opponent strategies for round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n   - They might switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again\n   - They might switch to rock for the high-value play\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since we both played paper, they might expect me to change strategies\n   - Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Many players switch after a tie, so they might move away from paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (common after paper), I lose only -1\n   - If they switch to rock (for high reward), we tie for 0\n\n6.

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, they played scissors (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Current total: +5 points\n\n2. Analyze my dominant performance:\n   - I've won 5 of the last 6 rounds\n   - I've correctly predicted their moves consistently\n   - My +5 point lead is very substantial\n   - They've played rock twice in a row (rounds 8-9)\n\n3. Study opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 5 moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock twice consecutively\n   - This suggests either a pattern or they're stuck in a losing mindset\n   - They might be defaulting to rock when uncertain\n\n4. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They're in a severe losing streak (lost 5 of last 6)\n   - They might be panicking or overthinking\n   - Playing rock twice suggests they might be hoping for a paper play from me\n   - They could be trying to set up for the high-value (+3) reward\n\n5. Analyze their potential next move:\n   - They might stick with rock a third time (hoping I'll finally play paper)\n   - They might switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock to counter their rock pattern)\n   - They might go to scissors (trying to break their losing pattern completely)\n   - Their rock repetition suggests they're either stuck in a pattern or setting a trap\n\n6. Strategic decision considerations:\n   - With a +5 lead, I can afford to be somewhat conservative\n   - If they play rock again: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: I need rock to win (+1)\n   - Scissors again covers 2 out of 3 scenarios favorably\n\n7. Pattern recognition risk:\n   - I've played scissors three times recently (rounds 7, 8, 9)\n   - They might finally adapt and expect scissors\n   - But their rock repetition suggests they're not adapting well\n   - My pattern has been winning, so breaking it might be premature\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors once more to exploit their apparent rock preference and maintain my winning strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze the incredible pattern:\n   - I've won 6 of the last 7 rounds\n   - They've played rock THREE times in a row (rounds 8, 9, 10)\n   - I've played scissors three times in a row and won each time\n   - My lead is now a commanding +6 points\n\n3. Study opponent's behavior:\n   - Their last 6 moves: paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock\n   - They're clearly stuck in a rock pattern\n   - This could be frustration, desperation, or a psychological trap\n   - But it's been 3 rounds - this seems like genuine pattern lock-in\n\n4. Consider why they keep playing rock:\n   - They might be desperately hoping I'll switch to paper for the +3 reward\n   - They could be psychologically stuck after repeated losses\n   - They might think I'll eventually stop playing scissors\n   - Or they're setting up an elaborate trap (though 3 losses suggest otherwise)\n\n5. Evaluate the risk of continuing scissors:\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock 3 times straight\n   - I've now played scissors 4 times in recent rounds\n   - They MUST be expecting scissors by now\n   - If they finally switch to paper, I lose -1 points\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - With +6 points, I have a massive lead\n   - I can afford to take a calculated risk\n   - If they're truly stuck in rock pattern, scissors wins again\n   - If they finally adapt to paper, I only lose 1 point\n   - Breaking my own pattern might be wise\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they switch (+1)\n   - Paper would beat rock if they continue (+1) \n   - Scissors would beat rock if they continue (+1) but lose to paper if they adapt (-1)\n   - Given their 3-rock streak, they're either trapped or about to spring a trap\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors one more time to exploit their apparent rock addiction, but this might be the last time if they don't break pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - They broke their 3-round rock pattern with paper\n   - This was a brilliant counter-strategy on their part\n   - They waited for me to get comfortable with scissors\n   - Then they switched to paper to beat my predictable scissors\n\n3. Recognize opponent's true skill level:\n   - This opponent is much more strategic than initially appeared\n   - They deliberately played rock 3 times to set up this trap\n   - They sacrificed 3 rounds (-3 points) to gain psychological advantage\n   - Then executed the counter perfectly\n\n4. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - I still have a +5 point lead, which is substantial\n   - But they've shown they can adapt and counter-strategize\n   - My scissors pattern is now broken and exposed\n   - They'll likely expect me to change tactics\n\n5. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might expect me to avoid scissors now\n   - They could anticipate rock (to beat scissors if I persist)\n   - They might expect paper (if they think I'll switch to rock)\n   - Or they could play anything, having proven their adaptability\n\n6. Strategic recalibration:\n   - I need to respect their strategic capability more\n   - I should avoid predictable patterns going forward\n   - With a +5 lead, I can afford to be more cautious\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n\n7. Decision analysis:\n   - If they expect me to avoid scissors: they might play rock or paper\n   - If they play rock: scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play paper: scissors beats it (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: rock beats it (+1)\n   - Rock seems like a good diversification from my scissors pattern\n   - It also covers the scenario where they expect me to change\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to break my scissors pattern and cover multiple opponent possibilities.\n\n[move] Rock"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-10: Previous rounds ending with +6 points after round 10\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Current total: +1 points\n\n2. Analyze this critical turning point:\n   - My lead has collapsed from +6 to just +1 points\n   - They correctly predicted I would switch to paper\n   - Their rock beat my paper for the maximum -3 penalty\n   - They've now won 4 of the last 5 rounds\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's masterful strategy:\n   - They successfully baited me into playing paper\n   - They anticipated my pattern-breaking attempt perfectly\n   - They went for the high-value rock play at exactly the right moment\n   - This opponent is reading me like a book\n\n4. Study their complete tactical approach:\n   - Their last 7 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n   - They've been setting up for this high-value rock play\n   - Each move has been part of a larger psychological strategy\n   - They're playing several moves ahead\n\n5. Assess the current crisis:\n   - My substantial lead has nearly evaporated\n   - They have complete momentum and confidence\n   - I'm being out-strategized consistently\n   - One more mistake could cost me the game\n\n6. Consider what they expect now:\n   - After the devastating -3 loss, they might expect me to be rattled\n   - They might think I'll avoid paper after that huge penalty\n   - They could expect me to return to scissors or rock\n   - They're probably feeling very confident about predicting my moves\n\n7. Strategic emergency response:\n   - I need to completely reset my thinking\n   - I can't afford another big loss\n   - I need to find a move they won't expect\n   - With only +1 points, I need to be extremely careful\n\n8. Deep analysis of their psychology:\n   - After such a successful rock play, they might be tempted to repeat it\n   - Or they might expect me to play scissors (to beat rock)\n   - They've shown they can predict my pattern breaks\n   - Maybe I need to return to something that worked before\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat rock if they try to repeat their successful high-value strategy.\n\n[move] (They might be tempted to repeat the successful rock strategy) scissors"

Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-10: Previous rounds ending with +6 points after round 10\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, they played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Current total: +2 points\n\n2. Analyze this important turning point:\n   - I correctly predicted they would repeat their successful rock strategy\n   - This breaks their 4-round winning streak\n   - My lead is now +2 points, still precarious but stabilizing\n   - They fell into the trap of overconfidence with rock\n\n3. Study their recent rock pattern:\n   - Their last 8 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock\n   - They've played rock in 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - Rock has been their most successful move recently\n   - They might be getting attached to it again\n\n4. Assess the psychological shift:\n   - After their devastating +3 victory, they got overconfident with rock\n   - My successful counter might shake their confidence\n   - They're realizing I can still predict their moves\n   - The momentum is shifting back toward balance\n\n5. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - After losing with rock twice to my scissors, they might avoid rock\n   - They could switch to paper (which has beaten my scissors before)\n   - They might try scissors to break away from the rock pattern\n   - Their ego might be bruised after the failed rock repeat\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic landscape:\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting scissors again): Paper beats scissors (-1 for me)\n   - If they play scissors (breaking rock pattern): Rock beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they stubbornly play rock again: Scissors beats rock (+1 for me)\n   - Paper seems most likely given their pattern of countering my successful moves\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - With only +2 points, I can't afford major losses\n   - They've shown they can adapt quickly to my patterns\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n   - They probably expect me to play scissors again after it just worked\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - They likely expect scissors after my successful prediction\n   - Paper would counter scissors effectively\n   - If I play rock instead, it beats their expected scissors counter\n   - Rock also gives me the high-value win if they surprisingly play paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors and potentially gain an advantage.\n\n[move] (They likely expect scissors again, so might switch to counter with scissors) rock"

Analyze this unexpected tie:\n   - We both played rock, neither gaining advantage\n   - They didn't switch to scissors or paper as I predicted\n   - They also thought rock was the right strategic choice\n   - This suggests we're thinking similarly about the game state\n\n3. Study their recent move pattern:\n   - Their last 9 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n   - They've now played rock 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - Rock is clearly their preferred move in uncertain situations\n   - They're showing strong attachment to rock strategy\n\n4. Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - We're both gravitating toward rock when uncertain\n   - This suggests rock feels \"safe\" to both of us\n   - The tie shows we're reading the game similarly\n   - But ties don't help me extend my narrow +2 lead\n\n5. Consider their psychology after the tie:\n   - They might stick with rock since it avoided a loss\n   - Or they might finally switch away from rock after the tie\n   - They could be frustrated that their rock preference is predictable\n   - The tie might prompt them to try something different\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with rock again: We tie for 0 points\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points for me)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n   - Rock seems strong if they switch, but ties if they don't\n\n7. Consider alternative approaches:\n   - Scissors would beat rock if they continue (+1 point)\n   - Paper would lose to rock if they continue (-1 point)\n   - Scissors has beaten their rock successfully before\n   - But they might finally adapt after so many rock plays\n\n8. Strategic decision analysis:\n   - Their rock attachment is so strong it might continue\n   - But the tie might finally force them to change\n   - Scissors has the best track record against their rock preference\n   - With +2 points, I can afford a small risk for potential gain\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to exploit their apparent rock obsession, betting they'll continue despite the tie.\n\n[move] (Betting on their continued rock preference despite the tie) scissors"

Analyze this surprising development:\n   - We both played scissors, creating another tie\n   - They switched from rock to scissors, exactly when I predicted they'd stick with rock\n   - This shows they're also trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - We're now in a pattern of matching each other's thinking\n\n3. Study the evolving pattern:\n   - Their last 10 moves: rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern with scissors\n   - They might have expected me to play rock to counter their rock tendency\n   - Instead, we both chose scissors\n\n4. Recognize the strategic convergence:\n   - We're both thinking several moves ahead\n   - We're both trying to counter-predict each other\n   - This is creating a pattern of ties when we think alike\n   - The game is becoming highly psychological\n\n5. Consider what just happened in their mind:\n   - They switched from rock to scissors\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (to beat their rock pattern)\n   - Instead I played scissors too\n   - They might be surprised by the tie\n\n6.

Strategic analysis:\n   - If they return to rock: Scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they try paper: Scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: We tie again (0)\n   - Rock would beat scissors if they continue (+1)\n\n8. Consider the psychology of consecutive ties:\n   - Ties can be frustrating and prompt changes\n   - They might want to \"win\" the next round decisively\n   - Paper offers no advantage, but rock gives them +3 if I play paper\n   - They might go for the high-reward rock play\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors again since it beats both rock (their comfort zone) and paper, with only scissors causing a tie.\n\n[move] (Scissors covers both their likely rock return and paper attempt) scissors"

Analyze my successful prediction:\n   - I correctly anticipated they would return to rock after the tie\n   - They fell back to their comfort zone move after the uncertainty\n   - My scissors beat their rock for +1 point\n   - I've now extended my lead back to +3 points\n\n3. Study their behavior pattern:\n   - After breaking their rock pattern with scissors (round 18), they returned to rock\n   - This confirms rock is their default \"safe\" move\n   - They seem to revert to rock when other strategies don't work\n   - Rock appears to be their psychological anchor\n\n4. Recognize the strategic momentum:\n   - I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds (rounds 16 and 19)\n   - The ties in rounds 17-18 didn't hurt my position\n   - I'm successfully reading their tendency to return to rock\n   - My +3 lead gives me some breathing room\n\n5.

Study their strategic thinking:\n   - They did exactly what I expected - played paper to beat scissors\n   - After losing to my scissors three times, they finally adapted\n   - But I was one step ahead and switched to rock\n   - They're showing they can learn but I'm out-thinking them\n\n4. Assess the current game state:\n   - I'm back to a commanding +6 point lead\n   - I've demonstrated I can predict their adaptations\n   - The momentum has swung strongly in my favor\n   - They must be frustrated by this major loss\n\n5.

Analyze this pattern of ties:\n   - We've now tied twice in a row with different moves\n   - Round 21: Both scissors\n   - Round 22: Both rock\n   - We're clearly thinking very similarly about the game state\n   - This suggests we're both using similar strategic reasoning\n\n3. Study the convergent thinking pattern:\n   - We both chose scissors when expecting the other to avoid their recent losing move\n   - We both chose rock when trying to counter the scissors tie\n   - This shows we're reading the game psychology similarly\n   - We're essentially playing against a mirror of our own strategy\n\n4. Recognize the strategic implications:\n   - Consecutive ties maintain my +6 lead without risk\n   - But ties don't help me extend the lead either\n   - We're in a phase of strategic equilibrium\n   - Breaking this pattern requires thinking differently than they do\n\n5. Consider what happens next in this tie sequence:\n   - We've tied with scissors, then rock\n   - The natural progression might be paper\n   - But they might also expect this obvious pattern\n   - Or they might try to break the tie sequence entirely\n\n6. Analyze their possible psychology:\n   - Two ties might be frustrating for them since they're behind\n   - They need to win rounds to catch up, ties don't help them\n   - They might take more risks to break the tie pattern\n   - Or they might continue the cautious approach\n\n7. Evaluate the strategic options:\n   - If we both play paper: Another tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper and I play scissors: I win (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern with scissors: Rock beats it (+1 point)\n   - If they break pattern with rock: Scissors beats it (+1 point)\n\n8. Consider breaking the mirroring:\n   - Since we're thinking alike, I need to think differently\n   - They might expect paper to complete the cycle\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they follow the pattern\n   - But if they try to counter-predict, they might avoid paper\n\n9. Strategic decision analysis:\n   - With a +6 lead, I can afford to take calculated risks\n   - Scissors beats paper (if they complete the pattern)\n   - Scissors also beats rock (if they revert to comfort zone)\n   - Only loses to paper, but that would just be another tie if we both avoid pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to break the tie pattern and potentially beat paper or rock.\n\n[move] (Breaking the mirroring pattern, expecting they might complete the cycle with paper) scissors"

            "text": "Let me analyze this successful pattern break and plan my next move.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1-10: Previous rounds ending with +6 points after round 10\n   - Round 11-21: Various rounds bringing total to +6 after round 21\n   - Round 22: I played rock, they played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1 points)\n   - Current total: +7 points\n\n2. Analyze this successful prediction:\n   - I correctly broke the mirroring pattern while they continued it\n   - They played rock, possibly expecting me to play paper to complete the cycle\n   - My scissors beat their rock for +1 point\n   - I've now extended my lead to +7 points\n\n3. Study their pattern behavior:\n   - After two ties (scissors, rock), they stuck with rock\n   - This confirms rock is still their default comfort move\n   - They didn't complete the paper cycle as I partially expected\n   - They're showing consistency in reverting to rock under uncertainty\n\n4. Recognize the strategic breakthrough:\n   - I successfully broke out of the mirroring pattern\n   - While they continued predictable behavior, I adapted\n   - This gives me insight into how to stay ahead of their thinking\n   - My +7 lead is now very substantial\n\n5. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors again\n   - This is now the fourth time my scissors has beaten their rock\n   - They must be recognizing this recurring pattern\n   - They're likely to finally avoid rock in the next round\n\n6. Analyze their probable next move:\n   - Paper would beat scissors (if they expect me to repeat scissors)\n   - Scissors would tie with scissors (if they think I'll stick with it)\n   - After losing to scissors so many times, paper seems most likely\n   - They've used paper successfully against my scissors before\n\n7. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play paper (most likely): Paper beats scissors, so I lose -1\n   - If they play scissors: We tie for 0 points\n   - If they stubbornly play rock again: Scissors beats rock for +1\n   - To beat paper, I need rock (+1 point, but only +1 since paper doesn't give +3 when losing)\n\n8. Correct rule check:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points for rock, -3 for paper)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point for paper, -1 for scissors)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point for scissors, -1 for rock)\n   - So if they play paper, I should play rock for +3 points\n\n9. Strategic decision:\n   - They're most likely to counter with paper after repeated scissors losses\n   - Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 points\n   - Even if wrong, the downside is manageable with my +7 lead\n   - This could potentially extend my lead to +10 points\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely paper response and potentially gain the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] (They're likely to counter my scissors success with paper) rock"
