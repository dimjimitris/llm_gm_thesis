    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first-move tendencies.\n\nMany people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy. Even if they don't choose Rock, Paper only loses to Scissors (giving me -1), while if I'm right about them choosing Rock, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper"

My opponent switched from their Scissors pattern to Rock at exactly the wrong moment for me. Their recent pattern shows:\n- Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n- They may be becoming more unpredictable or adapting to my attempts to counter their Scissors preference\n\nThey just won big with Rock (+3 points). Based on their previous behavior, they might:\n1. Stick with the successful Rock\n2. Return to their favored Scissors\n3. Continue being unpredictable\n\nI'm -5 points behind and need to start making better predictions. If they stick with Rock (repeating success), I should play Scissors for +1. If they go back to Scissors, we tie. If they try Paper, my Scissors wins +1.\n\nScissors gives me the best chance to win against their two most likely moves (Rock or Paper) with only a tie risk against Scissors.\n\nGiven that I'm significantly behind, I need to take calculated risks. Scissors offers good upside potential.\n\n[move] Scissors"

This is risky against their Scissors preference, but I need to stop being so predictable.\n\n[move] Paper"
