    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: The hint mentions this is a \"fresh player,\" suggesting they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Play randomly\n   - Have slight bias toward rock (most common first choice)\n   - May not immediately recognize the payoff asymmetry\n\n4. Develop opening strategy: Since rock has the highest payoff but paper beats rock, and fresh players often choose rock, paper seems like a strong opening move. It offers:\n   - High reward potential if opponent plays rock (+3 points)\n   - Low risk if opponent plays scissors (-1 point)\n   - No risk against paper (tie)\n\n5. Risk assessment: Paper maximizes expected value against a player likely to choose rock, while limiting downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper"

Strategy for beating rock:\n   - \"rock beats paper\" means paper loses to rock\n   - I need to find what beats rock: \"scissors beats rock\"\n   - So if opponent plays rock, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n4. Consider pattern reliability:\n   - The alternating R-S pattern has been consistent for 6 moves\n   - Opponent seems locked into this pattern\n   - High confidence they'll play rock next\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent plays rock (expected): scissors wins (+1)\n   - If opponent plays paper (pattern break): scissors loses to paper (-1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (pattern break): scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Strong pattern suggests rock is coming\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, downside is limited to -1\n   - Need to keep building back from -7 deficit\n\n[move] Scissors"

Game update:\n   - Round 11: I scissors, opponent scissors \u2192 Tie (0)\n   - Current total: -7 points\n   - The alternating R-S pattern I thought I identified has broken\n\n2. Updated opponent sequence:\n   - S,R,P,S,R,S,R,S,R,S,S\n   - Recent moves: R,S,R,S,R,S,S\n   - They broke their own alternating pattern by playing scissors twice in a row\n\n3. Possible explanations:\n   - They noticed I was catching onto their pattern\n   - They're adapting their strategy\n   - The pattern was coincidental, not intentional\n   - They might be trying to throw me off\n\n4. What to expect next:\n   - If they're truly random now: any move is equally likely\n   - If they return to alternating: next would be rock (after S,S)\n   - If they're counter-adapting: they might expect me to expect rock\n   - They might stick with scissors again\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - No clear pattern to rely on anymore\n   - Need to think about mixed strategies\n   - Rock has highest payoff (+3 when it wins)\n   - But also highest penalty (-3 when it loses)\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - With uncertainty, I should consider expected values\n   - If opponent plays randomly: Rock has 1/3 chance of +3, 1/3 chance of -3, 1/3 chance of 0 = expected value 0\n   - Paper: 1/3 chance of +1, 1/3 chance of -3, 1/3 chance of 0 = expected value -2/3\n   - Scissors: 1/3 chance of +1, 1/3 chance of -1, 1/3 chance of 0 = expected value 0\n   \nRock and scissors have same expected value if truly random, but rock has higher variance.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze this new behavior:\n   - They completely abandoned the R-S alternating pattern\n   - Now playing scissors consistently\n   - This could be:\n     * A new pattern (sticking with scissors)\n     * A temporary phase before switching\n     * Response to my recent moves\n\n4.

Conservative approach:\n   - Play moves that limit maximum loss\n   - Scissors loses max -1 to paper, wins +1 vs rock, ties vs scissors\n   - Paper loses max -3 to rock, wins +1 vs scissors, ties vs paper\n   - Rock loses max -1 to scissors, wins +3 vs paper, ties vs rock\n\n6. Safe choice:\n   - Between scissors and rock (both max -1 loss), rock has higher upside\n   - But they've beaten my rock with scissors multiple times\n   - Let me try scissors again - if they repeat paper, I only lose -1\n\n[move] Scissors"

Game update:\n   - Round 22: I scissors, opponent rock \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Current total: -12 points\n   - Second win overall (rounds 10 and 22)\n\n2. What just happened:\n   - I played scissors, they played rock\n   - This is the same combination that won me round 17\n   - Both times I won, it was scissors beating rock\n\n3. Simple observation:\n   - My two wins came when I played scissors against their rock\n   - I don't need to overthink why this happened\n   - Just note that scissors has worked for me twice now\n\n4. Keep it simple:\n   - I'm at -12 and need more wins\n   - Overthinking has consistently failed me\n   - The opponent seems to read complex strategies well\n   - Maybe stick with what has actually worked\n\n5. Recent pattern of what works:\n   - Scissors beat rock twice for me\n   - When I play paper, we often tie\n   - When I play rock, they usually beat it with scissors\n\n6. Straightforward choice:\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move\n   - It limits downside (-1 max) while offering upside (+1)\n   - No complex reasoning - just go with what has worked\n\n[move] Scissors"

            "text": "Back to losing. They countered my scissors with paper. I need to accept that this opponent is just very good at reading me.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Game update:\n   - Round 23: I scissors, opponent paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Current total: -13 points\n   - Right back where I was before the brief win\n\n2. What happened:\n   - I won with scissors in round 22\n   - Immediately tried scissors again in round 23\n   - They countered with paper\n   - They adapted instantly to my successful move\n\n3. Pattern recognition about me:\n   - When something works for me, I tend to repeat it\n   - The opponent seems to notice this and counter immediately\n   - My predictability is being exploited\n\n4. Key insight:\n   - I can't rely on repeating successful moves\n   - The opponent adapts too quickly\n   - I need to avoid being readable, even when I win\n\n5. Strategic adjustment:\n   - Don't repeat what just worked\n   - Don't fall into patterns they can exploit\n   - Make each move independently without reference to previous success\n\n6. This round's choice:\n   - They just played paper to beat my scissors\n   - I shouldn't assume they'll repeat paper\n   - I shouldn't assume they'll switch from paper\n   - Just make a choice: Rock beats paper if they repeat, but loses to scissors\n   - Paper ties with paper if they repeat, beats scissors if they switch\n   - Let me go with rock - if they repeat paper, I get the big +3 payoff I need\n\n[move] Rock"
