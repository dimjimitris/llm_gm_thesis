Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Opponent played rock (7 times)\n   - Rounds 8-15: Opponent played paper (8 times)\n   - Rounds 16-21: Opponent played scissors (6 times)\n   - Last four rounds: I played paper and won +1 each time\n   - Current score: +12 + 1 = +13 points\n\n2. Pattern milestone tracking:\n   - Opponent has now played scissors SIX consecutive times\n   - This is approaching their previous commitment levels (7 rocks, 8 papers)\n   - Their scissors phase shows the same strong commitment pattern\n   - My paper counter-strategy has been flawless for four straight rounds\n\n3. Strategic excellence assessment:\n   - Four consecutive +1 victories with paper vs scissors\n   - My adaptation from exploiting their paper phase to scissors phase was perfect\n   - Total score of +13 shows highly successful pattern recognition\n   - The consistency of their behavior continues to be exploitable\n\n4. Predictive outlook:\n   - Based on their history, they might play scissors for 1-2 more rounds\n   - They could reach 7-8 scissors to match their previous streak lengths\n   - Paper remains the mathematically optimal counter to scissors\n   - Their commitment pattern suggests continued scissors play\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Six consecutive scissors demonstrates strong phase commitment\n   - Paper has delivered perfect results against their scissors strategy\n   - Their behavioral pattern shows no signs of changing yet\n   - I should maximize this advantage while their predictable pattern holds\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors six consecutive times, matching their strong commitment pattern, so paper remains the optimal counter for another guaranteed +1) paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Opponent played rock (7 times)\n   - Rounds 8-15: Opponent played paper (8 times)\n   - Rounds 16-22: Opponent played scissors (7 times)\n   - Last five rounds: I played paper and won +1 each time\n   - Current score: +13 + 1 = +14 points\n\n2. Pattern milestone analysis:\n   - Opponent has now played scissors SEVEN consecutive times\n   - This exactly matches their initial rock streak length (7 rounds)\n   - Their scissors phase has reached the same commitment level as their rock phase\n   - My paper counter-strategy has been perfect for five straight rounds\n\n3. Critical transition consideration:\n   - They've now matched their rock streak with scissors (7 each)\n   - Their paper phase exceeded this at 8 rounds\n   - This could be another natural transition point where they might switch\n   - However, they might continue to match or exceed their paper streak (8+)\n\n4. Strategic risk assessment:\n   - If they continue with scissors (8th time), my paper wins +1\n   - If they switch to rock, my paper wins +3 (excellent outcome)\n   - If they switch to paper, my paper ties for 0 (neutral)\n   - Paper remains optimal or neutral against all possibilities\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Even at a potential transition point, paper is still the best choice\n   - Paper beats scissors (if they continue) and rock (if they switch back)\n   - My winning streak and excellent score (+14) suggests maintaining the strategy\n   - The mathematical expected value of paper remains highest\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors seven consecutive times, matching their rock streak length, but paper remains optimal whether they continue or switch back to rock) paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-7: Opponent played rock (7 times)\n   - Rounds 8-15: Opponent played paper (8 times)\n   - Rounds 16-22: Opponent played scissors (7 times)\n   - Round 23: Opponent switched back to rock (I lost -3)\n   - Current score: +14 - 3 = +11 points\n\n2. Pattern cycle analysis:\n   - Opponent completed a full cycle: rock (7) \u2192 paper (8) \u2192 scissors (7) \u2192 rock again\n   - They've returned to rock after completing their scissors phase\n   - This suggests they might be cycling through the moves in order\n   - The cycle pattern appears to be: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock...\n\n3. Strategic reassessment:\n   - If opponent is starting a new rock phase, I should play paper (+3)\n   - If they continue cycling, they might do another extended rock streak\n   - Paper beats rock for the high reward of +3 points\n   - This could be the start of another profitable rock-countering phase\n\n4. Historical pattern consideration:\n   - Their first rock phase lasted 7 rounds\n   - If they're cycling, this new rock phase might also be extended\n   - Paper was highly profitable during their first rock phase (when I figured it out)\n   - I should capitalize on this potential new rock phase immediately\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - The switch back to rock suggests a cyclical pattern\n   - Paper is the optimal counter to rock (+3 points)\n   - I need to exploit this new rock phase like I did with their previous phases\n   - Early adaptation to pattern changes has been key to my success\n\n[move] (Opponent switched back to rock after completing their scissors phase, likely starting a new rock cycle, so paper is the optimal counter for +3 points) paper"
