Re-evaluating the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 (highest stakes)\n   - Paper beating scissors gives +1/-1 (lower stakes)\n   - Scissors beating rock gives +1/-1 (lower stakes)\n\n4.

Key observation: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I should consider:\n   - New players often default to rock as it's perceived as \"strong\"\n   - They may not have developed complex strategies yet\n   - Rock is a common first choice in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (likely for a new player), I should choose paper to win 3 points\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors to win 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win 3 points\n\n5.

Predictive analysis:\n   - Based on their history, they might play paper for 1-2 more rounds to match their rock streak length\n   - Even if they eventually switch to scissors, rock would still win +3\n   - There's virtually no downside to continuing with rock\n   - Their commitment patterns suggest paper will continue\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Six consecutive papers shows deep commitment to this strategy\n   - Rock has been perfect counter-strategy with guaranteed +3 returns\n   - No logical reason to deviate from what's working so effectively\n   - I should maximize this advantage while their pattern holds\n\n[move] (Opponent has now played paper six consecutive times, matching their strong commitment pattern, so rock remains the optimal choice for another +3) rock",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Pattern milestone tracking:\n   - Opponent has now played scissors SIX consecutive times\n   - This is approaching their previous commitment levels (7 rocks, 8 papers)\n   - Their scissors phase shows the same strong commitment pattern\n   - I've achieved four consecutive +1 victories with paper counter-strategy\n\n3. Strategic consistency evaluation:\n   - My adaptation to each of their phases has been highly successful\n   - Paper vs scissors has been flawless for four rounds running\n   - Total score of +13 shows excellent overall performance\n   - The pattern-based counter-strategy continues to work perfectly\n\n4. Phase progression analysis:\n   - They might continue scissors for 1-2 more rounds to match their previous streaks\n   - Based on history: 7 rocks \u2192 8 papers \u2192 potentially 7+ scissors\n   - Paper remains the mathematically optimal counter to scissors\n   - Even if they eventually switch, I can adapt the counter-strategy again\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Six consecutive scissors demonstrates strong ongoing commitment\n   - Paper has been the perfect counter with guaranteed +1 returns\n   - Their behavioral pattern suggests continued scissors play\n   - Maintaining this successful strategy maximizes my advantage\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors six consecutive times, nearing their typical commitment length, so paper remains the optimal counter for another guaranteed +1) paper",
