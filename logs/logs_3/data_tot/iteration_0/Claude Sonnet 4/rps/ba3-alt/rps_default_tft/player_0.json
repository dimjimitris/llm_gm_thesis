    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me examine the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Ties give 0 points\n\nThe key insight is that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. In classic rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of.\n\nGiven that rock gives the highest payoff when successful, and considering that a fresh player might default to rock, I should play paper to counter this tendency while also positioning myself for the maximum point gain.\n\n[move] Paper"

This gives me some information about their thinking.\n\nSince they also chose paper in the first round, they might have been thinking similarly about countering a potential rock play, or they could be playing randomly. \n\nFor this second round, I need to consider:\n1. They might stick with paper if they think it's a \"safe\" choice\n2. They might switch to rock thinking I'll play paper again\n3. They might go to scissors to counter if they expect me to repeat paper\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest payoff (+3 points), and there's uncertainty about their pattern after just one tie, I think rock is a strong choice here. If they stick with paper (which many players do after a tie), I'll get the maximum 3 points. If they switch to scissors thinking I'll play paper again, I lose only 1 point.\n\nThe risk-reward ratio favors rock in this situation.\n\n[move] Rock"
