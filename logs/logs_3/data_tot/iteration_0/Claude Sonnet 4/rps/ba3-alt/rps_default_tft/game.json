Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people tend to choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games due to its psychological appeal as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and many new players gravitate toward it, I'll play Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. If they choose Paper or Scissors instead, I'll either tie or lose 1 point, but the potential upside of beating Rock (+3 points) makes this a good strategic choice.\n\n[move] Paper"

This is different from traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nSo the correct rules are:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1 for me)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3 for winner) \n- Scissors beats Rock (+1 for winner)\n\nNow for round 2 strategy: My opponent chose Scissors in round 1. They might:\n1. Stick with Scissors (thinking it's good)\n2. Switch to Rock (to counter my Paper)\n3. Switch to Paper (random change)\n\nIf they stick with Scissors, I should play Paper again (+1).\nIf they switch to Rock, I should play Scissors (+1).\nIf they switch to Paper, I should play Rock (+3).\n\nSince Rock gives the highest reward (+3) and there's a reasonable chance they might switch to Paper (either randomly or thinking Paper is strong since I won with it), I'll take the higher-risk, higher-reward play.\n\n[move] Rock"

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people tend to choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games due to its psychological appeal as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and many new players gravitate toward it, I'll play Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. If they choose Paper or Scissors instead, I'll either tie or lose 1 point, but the potential upside of beating Rock (+3 points) makes this a good strategic choice.\n\n[move] Paper",

They haven't used Scissors in several rounds (last was round 9), so this might be them cycling back through their options.\n\nLooking at their pattern, they seem to be exploring different strategies. After two Papers, they went to Scissors. They might:\n1. Continue with Scissors\n2. Go back to Rock (still their most frequent)\n3. Try Paper again\n\nGiven that Rock is still their most played move and they just broke away from Paper, I think they might return to Rock.\n\nFor round 20:\n- If they play Rock: I should play Scissors (+1)\n- If they play Scissors: I should play Paper (+1)\n- If they play Paper: I should play Rock (+3)\n\nI'll anticipate a return to Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people tend to choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games due to its psychological appeal as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward and many new players gravitate toward it, I'll play Paper to counter a potential Rock choice. If they choose Paper or Scissors instead, I'll either tie or lose 1 point, but the potential upside of beating Rock (+3 points) makes this a good strategic choice.\n\n[move] Paper",
