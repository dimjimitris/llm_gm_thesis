    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice that rock has the highest reward when it wins (+3 points), but also the highest penalty when it loses (-3 points to paper).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet and might make random or predictable choices.\n\n4. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I should play paper to get the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper is a reasonable choice because:\n   - If they play scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock, I win 3 points\n\n7. The risk-reward ratio favors paper as a strong opening move against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a beginner's tendency to choose rock, while limiting my downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze what happened in round 1:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This tells me the opponent also might be thinking strategically or had similar reasoning\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior patterns:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - This could indicate they're also trying to counter an expected rock move\n   - Or they might be thinking similarly about maximizing the rock payoff\n\n3. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - If they stick with paper, I should play rock for the +3 points\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should play paper again\n   - If they switch to scissors (trying to counter my potential rock), I should play rock\n\n4. Consider the psychological aspect:\n   - After a tie, many players will either stick with their move or switch to counter what they think the opponent will do\n   - Some players follow patterns like \"rock after paper\"\n\n5. Evaluate risk-reward for my options:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) if they play paper, high penalty (-1) if they play scissors\n   - Paper: Medium reward (+3) if they play rock, low penalty (-1) if they play scissors  \n   - Scissors: Low reward (+1) if they play rock, low penalty (-3) if they play rock\n\n6. Since they played paper last round, there's a reasonable chance they might switch to rock this round, expecting me to stay with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get the maximum 3 points if they switch to rock, or counter their paper if they stick with it.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: Me rock, Opponent paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 4: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 5: Me rock, Opponent paper (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 6: Me rock, Opponent scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 7: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 8: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 9: Me rock, Opponent paper (I won +3 points)\n\n2. Track opponent's full sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - Paper appears 6 times out of 9 rounds (67% of the time)\n   - They've returned to their heavy paper preference\n\n3. Identify patterns in my wins:\n   - All three victories: I played rock, they played paper\n   - Rock vs Paper = +3 points each time\n   - This is their most exploitable weakness\n\n4. Current score calculation:\n   - My total: +3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 = +8 points\n   - Strong lead maintained and growing\n\n5. Analyze opponent psychology:\n   - Despite losing to rock three times, they keep returning to paper\n   - They seem unable to break their paper habit consistently\n   - Brief diversification (scissors, rock) didn't stick\n\n6. Strategic observations:\n   - Paper is clearly their comfort zone/default move\n   - They temporarily adapt but revert to paper\n   - My rock strategy has been highly profitable against their paper tendency\n\n7. Predict next move:\n   - High probability they'll play paper again (their dominant pattern)\n   - Lower chance they'll try scissors (worked once before)\n   - Very low chance they'll play rock (only played twice total)\n\n8. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper (most likely): Rock wins +3 points\n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins +1 point\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins +3 points\n\n9. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock has excellent expected value given their paper preference\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I still win +1\n   - Only vulnerable to rock, which they rarely play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again to exploit their persistent paper preference, aiming for a fourth +3 point victory.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify their adaptation strategy:\n   - They seem to predict when I'll play rock\n   - After I won with rock in round 9, they countered with scissors in round 10\n   - This shows they're learning and timing their scissors strategically\n\n4. Current score:\n   - My total: +3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 1 = +7 points\n   - Still maintaining a good lead despite recent loss\n\n5. Analyze their counter-strategy:\n   - They appear to be saving scissors for when they expect rock\n   - After my rock victories, they anticipate I'll continue with rock\n   - This is more sophisticated than random play\n\n6. Strategic insight:\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since I've been successful with it)\n   - If they play scissors expecting rock, I should play rock to beat scissors (+1)\n   - But if they think I'll switch strategies, they might go back to paper\n\n7. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my rock): Rock wins +1 point\n   - If they play paper (their default): Rock wins +3 points\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins +3 points\n\n8. Meta-game analysis:\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors\n   - They might stick with scissors thinking I'll play rock again\n   - Or they might switch back to paper thinking I'll change strategies\n\n9. Decision logic:\n   - Rock still beats both scissors (+1) and paper (+3)\n   - Even though they just beat my rock, rock remains optimal against their likely moves\n   - The key is that rock beats their two most common moves\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock again because it beats both their scissors counter-strategy and their paper preference, giving me positive expected value.\n\n[move] rock"

Identify the clear counter-strategy:\n   - Every time they play scissors, I had played rock\n   - They've figured out my rock preference and are exploiting it\n   - This is no longer coincidental - it's deliberate\n\n4. Current score:\n   - My total: +3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 1 + 0 - 1 = +6 points\n   - Lead shrinking due to repeated scissors counters\n\n5. Analyze my predictability:\n   - I've played rock in 8 out of 12 rounds (67%)\n   - My rock strategy was profitable early but now being exploited\n   - I need to break this predictable pattern\n\n6. Strategic realization:\n   - They expect me to play rock again\n   - If they play scissors expecting rock, I should play rock (+1)\n   - But if they think I'll finally switch, they might change their strategy\n\n7. Consider their psychology:\n   - They just successfully used scissors against my rock for the third time\n   - They might stick with scissors expecting me to continue with rock\n   - Or they might switch thinking I'll finally adapt\n\n8. Evaluate counter-strategy options:\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n\n9.

Strategic assessment:\n   - They're now heavily favoring scissors (4 of last 7 rounds)\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch back to paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play rock: Paper beats rock (+3)\n\n7. Predict their next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors thinking I'll go back to rock\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll continue with paper\n   - Less likely they'll go to paper after being in scissors mode\n\n8.

Track opponent's recent sequence evolution:\n   - Last 5 rounds: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now switched from heavy scissors usage to rock\n   - This suggests they're adapting to my strategy changes\n\n3. Analyze their strategic shift:\n   - After I played paper and beat their scissors, they switched to rock\n   - They might be trying to counter my potential paper continuation\n   - Or they're moving away from the scissors strategy that was getting predictable\n\n4. Current score:\n   - My total: +7 + 0 = +7 points\n   - Maintaining lead but need to keep adapting\n\n5. Examine the meta-game:\n   - I broke my rock pattern with paper in round 13 and won\n   - I returned to rock in round 14 and tied\n   - They're now showing they can adapt by switching to rock\n\n6. Predict their psychology:\n   - They just played rock, possibly expecting me to play paper again\n   - They might continue with rock if they think it's working\n   - Or they might switch to paper expecting me to counter their rock\n\n7. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they continue with rock: Paper wins +3 points\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins +3 points  \n   - If they go to scissors: Rock wins +1 point\n\n8. Pattern analysis:\n   - Their recent moves show more variation: Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more reactive\n   - Need to think about what they expect me to do\n\n9. Evaluate expected opponent behavior:\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their rock\n   - If they expect my paper, they might play scissors\n   - If they stick with rock, I should play paper\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n    - Rock: Beats scissors (+1) and paper (+3), loses to rock (-3)\n    - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n11. Decision logic:\n    - They just played rock, likely expecting me to counter with paper\n    - If they expect my paper, they might switch to scissors\n    - But if they think I'll stick with rock, they might continue with rock\n    - Paper seems optimal against their likely rock continuation\n\n[move] (Countering their likely continued rock play for maximum points) paper"

Identify the pattern:\n   - When I played paper (round 13), they had scissors\n   - When I played rock (round 14), they had rock\n   - When I played paper (round 15), they had scissors again\n   - They seem to be countering my expected moves but with a delay\n\n4. Current score:\n   - My total: +7 + 0 + 1 = +8 points\n   - Building my lead again with strategic adaptation\n\n5.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played paper, they played scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - They broke the mirroring pattern\n   - They correctly predicted I would switch from rock and countered with scissors\n\n2. Track their recent sequence:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They went from mirroring (rock-rock-rock) to counter-predicting (scissors)\n   - This shows they're actively adapting to my strategy changes\n\n3. Current score:\n   - My total: +2 + 1 = +3 points\n   - Small gain but they're getting better at reading me\n\n4. Analyze their strategic evolution:\n   - They successfully predicted I would switch from rock to paper\n   - Played scissors to beat my paper\n   - Wait - I won with paper vs scissors, so paper beats scissors (+1)\n\n5. Correct understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 to paper player)\n   - So they made an error by playing scissors when I played paper\n   - Or they were expecting me to play something else\n\n6. Consider their psychology:\n   - They might have expected me to play rock again (continuing the pattern)\n   - Scissors beats rock, so that would have been their winning move\n   - But I switched to paper, which beat their scissors\n\n7. Predict their next move:\n   - They just made a prediction error with scissors\n   - They might stick with scissors or switch strategies\n   - They could return to mirroring or try a new approach\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - If they play scissors again: Paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors beats rock (+1)\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n\n9. Evaluate their likely behavior:\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper (since it just won)\n   - If they expect paper, they might play rock to beat it\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points to them\n\n10. Risk assessment:\n    - If they play rock (expecting my paper): I should play scissors (+1)\n    - If they play scissors again: I should play paper (+1)\n    - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n11. Decision logic:\n    - They likely expect me to repeat my winning paper move\n    - If they counter with rock, I should play scissors\n    - Scissors gives me a win regardless of rock or continued scissors\n\n[move] (They might expect me to repeat paper and counter with rock) scissors"
