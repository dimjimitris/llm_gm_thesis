First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock first (it's psychologically associated with strength)\n   - Or choose randomly without much thought\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), but fresh players often choose rock, I should consider what beats rock: scissors.\n\n5. However, if the opponent chooses paper (which beats rock and they might think I'll choose rock), then scissors would give me +1 points.\n\n6. The safest high-reward strategy is to play paper, because:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely for a fresh player), I get +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose only -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n[move] paper"

Since we both chose paper, this suggests the opponent is thinking strategically about the payoff matrix.\n\n3. Now I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a good strategy\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might choose scissors to counter paper\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, I should consider:\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper again (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Since rock gives the highest payoff (+3) and the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might now expect me to stick with paper and counter with scissors.\n\n6. Playing rock would:\n   - Give me +3 if they play scissors (likely)\n   - Give me +3 if they play paper (possible)\n   - Give me 0 if they also play rock\n   - Only give me -1 if they play scissors (wait, that's wrong - scissors beats rock for +1 to them, -1 to me)\n\nLet me recalculate: If I play rock:\n- vs scissors: I win +1 (scissors beats rock, so I lose -1)\n- vs paper: I lose -3 \n- vs rock: tie 0\n\nActually, let me re-read the rules... \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\" - so if they play scissors and I play rock, they get +1 and I get -1.\n\nGiven their strategic play, I think they might play scissors expecting me to repeat paper.

Current score: -7 points total (improved from -8)\n\n3. Key insight: This is the SECOND time I've successfully beaten their rock with scissors (rounds 6 and 10). The pattern is clear:\n   - When I play paper, they play rock and win big\n   - When I play scissors, they still play rock and I win\n\n4. Opponent's rock obsession: They've now played rock 7 out of 10 times! Their pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock\n\n5. Critical observation: Even after losing to my scissors twice, they're still playing rock. This suggests:\n   - They're either very committed to the rock strategy\n   - They haven't fully adapted to my scissors counter\n   - They might be expecting me to go back to paper\n\n6. Strategic decision point:\n   - If they continue with rock (likely given their pattern), scissors wins again (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to counter my scissors), I should play rock (+3 - the big win!)\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n7. The opponent has been incredibly stubborn with rock. But after losing twice to scissors, they might finally adapt and switch to paper.\n\n8. This could be my opportunity for the big +3 point swing with rock! If they're thinking \"they beat my rock twice with scissors, so they'll probably play scissors again, so I should play paper,\" then I should play rock.\n\n9. Given their pattern and the fact that they just lost to scissors again, I think there's a good chance they'll switch to paper this time.\n\n[move] rock"

Current score: -7 points total\n\n3. Shocking consistency: The opponent has now played rock 8 out of 11 times! Even after losing to scissors twice in rounds 6 and 10, they STILL played rock in round 11.\n\n4. Updated opponent pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n\n5. This level of rock commitment suggests:\n   - They have an extremely strong bias toward rock\n   - They're either not learning from losses or are very stubborn\n   - They might believe rock is the optimal long-term strategy\n   - They could be trying to exploit any tendency I have to move away from scissors\n\n6. Key insight: The only move that has consistently worked for me is scissors against their rock. I've won +2 points total from scissors (rounds 6 and 10), while losing -9 points from paper against rock.\n\n7. Given their incredible rock consistency (8/11 times), the probability they'll play rock again seems very high.\n\n8. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): scissors wins +1\n   - If they finally switch to paper: I lose -1 with scissors\n   - If they play scissors: tie with scissors\n\n9. The risk-reward favors scissors:\n   - High probability of +1 (if they play rock again)\n   - Low probability of -1 (if they finally switch to paper)\n   - Their pattern suggests they're unlikely to deviate from rock\n\n10. I should capitalize on their rock obsession with scissors again.\n\n[move] scissors"

Current score: -6 points total (improved from -7)\n\n3. Astonishing pattern: The opponent has now played rock 9 out of 12 times! They have lost to my scissors THREE times now (rounds 6, 10, and 12) and they STILL keep playing rock.\n\n4. Updated opponent pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock\n\n5. This is beyond stubborn - this appears to be either:\n   - A deeply ingrained strategy they refuse to abandon\n   - They're testing if I'll stick with scissors\n   - They believe the +3 payoff from rock makes it worth the occasional -1 loss\n   - They might be banking on me eventually switching away from scissors\n\n6. Critical analysis:\n   - Every time I've played scissors against their rock, I've won (+1 each time)\n   - They've gotten +9 points from beating my paper with rock\n   - But they've given me +3 points by losing to my scissors\n\n7. The pattern is so strong (9/12 rock plays) that it seems almost certain they'll play rock again.\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock (extremely likely based on pattern): scissors wins +1\n   - If they finally adapt and play paper: I lose -1 with scissors\n   - If they play scissors: tie\n\n9. Given their incredible rock consistency, even after losing three times to scissors, I should continue exploiting this with scissors.\n\n10. At this point, scissors seems like the obvious optimal play against this opponent.\n\n[move] scissors"

Current score: -7 points total (dropped from -6)\n\n3. MAJOR development: After playing rock 9 out of 12 times, the opponent FINALLY switched to paper in round 13! This is huge.\n\n4. Why did they switch now?\n   - They lost to my scissors three times in a row (rounds 10, 12, and were about to lose again)\n   - They finally adapted and played paper to counter my scissors pattern\n   - They realized I had figured out their rock obsession\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - They've shown they CAN adapt when losses pile up\n   - They might expect me to continue with scissors (since it was working)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch strategies now that they've countered me\n\n6. What will they do next?\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I'll continue with scissors\n   - They might go back to rock (their favorite move)\n   - They might try scissors to mix things up\n\n7. If they stick with paper (thinking I'll play scissors again), I should play rock for the big +3 point win!\n\n8. If they go back to rock (reverting to their preferred strategy), I should play scissors again.\n\n9.

          "text": "Let me analyze this continuing evolution in strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Game history summary:\n   - Round 1-12: Opponent played rock 9/12 times, I found success with scissors\n   - Round 13: Opponent switched to paper, beat my scissors (-1 for me)\n   - Round 14: Opponent played rock, tied with my rock (0 points)\n\n2. Current score: -7 points total\n\n3. Opponent's recent pattern shift:\n   - They broke their rock obsession in round 13 with paper\n   - Then immediately went back to rock in round 14\n   - This suggests they're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n\n4. Updated opponent pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock\n   - Still heavily rock-biased (10 out of 14 times now)\n   - But they've shown they can switch when needed\n\n5. Key insight: The opponent demonstrated they CAN adapt (round 13 paper), but then reverted to rock (round 14). This suggests:\n   - Rock is still their preferred/default strategy\n   - They'll switch tactically when they detect a pattern in my play\n   - They might be testing if I'll go back to scissors\n\n6. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - If they play rock again (likely, given their bias): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting scissors): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. The question is: Will they stick with rock (their comfort zone) or try to counter-predict my next move?\n\n8. Given that they just tied with rock and have shown they can adapt when losing, they might:\n   - Expect me to go back to scissors (which was working before)\n   - Play paper to counter expected scissors\n\n9. However, their overwhelming rock bias (10/14 times) suggests rock is still most likely.\n\n10. I think they'll play rock again, so scissors is the optimal counter.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n\n2. Current score: -8 points total\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now played paper TWICE in the last 3 rounds (rounds 13 and 15), both times successfully countering my scissors!\n\n4. Major strategic shift detected:\n   - The opponent was rock-heavy for rounds 1-12 (9/12 times)\n   - But in rounds 13-15, they've played: paper, rock, paper\n   - They've successfully adapted to counter my scissors strategy\n\n5. What's happening:\n   - They realized I had figured out their rock pattern and was exploiting it with scissors\n   - They've shifted to playing paper more frequently to counter my scissors\n   - They're now predicting my moves better\n\n6. Updated opponent strategy analysis:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy (trying to get +3 wins against paper)\n   - Mid-game: I exploited their rock with scissors\n   - Late game: They're now countering my scissors with paper\n\n7. Strategic implications for next move:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors again: they'll play paper (and win)\n   - If they think I'll adapt and play rock: they might play paper (tie) or rock (I win +3)\n   - If they revert to rock: I should play scissors\n\n8.

If they think I'll move away from scissors, they might:\n   - Go back to rock (their original favorite)\n   - Play scissors themselves\n   - Stick with paper\n\n10. I think this is the moment to capitalize on their expectation that I'll avoid scissors. If they're expecting me to play rock or paper, they might revert to rock.

Current score: -5 points total (improved significantly from -8)\n\n3. Strategic breakthrough: I finally got the +3 point win by correctly predicting they would stick with paper!\n\n4.

Key insight: The opponent has shifted from being rock-heavy to being paper-heavy, trying to counter what they perceived as my scissors pattern.\n\n6.

Given that they just lost big with paper, they might abandon the paper strategy and go back to rock. But they also might think I expect this and stick with paper.\n\n10.

Excellent prediction: I correctly anticipated that after losing big with paper (-3 points), they would revert to their comfort zone of rock, and my scissors won!\n\n4.

Current opponent psychology:\n   - They just lost with rock again (4th time losing to my scissors overall)\n   - They've now lost with both their main strategies: rock (to scissors) and paper (to rock)\n   - They might be feeling pressured to try something different\n\n6.

Current score: -5 points total (dropped from -4)\n\n3. Significant development: The opponent finally played scissors! This is notable because:\n   - They've been heavily focused on rock and paper throughout the game\n   - Scissors has been relatively rare in their strategy\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy strategy\n   - Mid-game: Shifted to paper to counter my scissors\n   - Recent: Mix of rock, paper, and now scissors\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - They're no longer predictably favoring one move\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They might continue with more varied play\n\n6. What might they do next?\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They could go back to their previous patterns (rock or paper)\n   - They might try to be even more unpredictable\n\n7. Counter-analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to counter scissors with rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n8. Given that they just successfully used scissors and might expect me to counter it, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with scissors (since it worked)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting my rock counter)\n\n9.

Great prediction: I correctly anticipated that after winning with scissors, they would either stick with scissors or switch to paper (expecting me to counter with rock). They chose paper, and my rock got the big +3 win!\n\n4. Progress analysis: I've now won 2 out of the last 4 rounds, including two +3 victories!

Key observation: They're cycling through all three moves more frequently now, but they just took another big -3 hit with paper against my rock.\n\n7.

Strategic considerations:\n   - They just lost with paper, so they might avoid it next round\n   - They might go back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - They might try scissors again (it worked in round 18)\n   - They could try anything to break the cycle\n\n9. Counter-strategies:\n   - If they play rock (reverting to old pattern): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (trying what worked before): I should play rock (+1) \n   - If they play paper again: I should play rock (+3)\n\n10. Given their tendency to cycle and the fact that they just lost with paper, I think rock or scissors are most likely. Since rock has been their historical go-to move under pressure, I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (unchanged from tie)\n\n3. Unexpected tie: Both of us played scissors. This suggests:\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable\n   - We might be developing similar strategic thinking\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent's last 4 moves were rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves more equally\n   - No clear bias toward any single move recently\n   - They're adapting and becoming harder to predict\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent is no longer following their old rock-heavy pattern\n   - They're actively trying to be unpredictable\n   - This makes the game more challenging but also more fair\n\n6. What might they do next after the tie?\n   - They might stick with scissors (since it didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock or paper to try to gain an advantage\n   - They could try to predict what I'll do after the tie\n\n7. My strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n8. After a tie, players often switch moves rather than repeat. They might move away from scissors.\n\n9. Given their recent pattern of cycling through moves and trying to be unpredictable, they might play rock or paper next.\n\n10. Since I need to recover points (still at -2), I should aim for a move that can win big. If they play paper, rock gives me +3. If they play rock, scissors gives me +1. Rock seems like the better risk/reward choice, especially since they haven't played paper in two rounds.\n\n[move] rock"

Current score: -2 points total (still unchanged)\n\n3. Back-to-back ties: We've now tied twice in a row with scissors, then rock. This is unusual and suggests:\n   - We're thinking very similarly about strategy\n   - The opponent might be trying to mirror my logic\n   - Or we're both trying to be \"one level deeper\" in our predictions\n\n4. Opponent's recent pattern: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock\n   - They've now used all three moves in the last 5 rounds\n   - Very balanced distribution, no clear bias\n   - They're successfully staying unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic consideration: After two ties, what typically happens?\n   - Players often try to break the pattern\n   - They might avoid the moves that just tied\n   - Or they might think the opponent will avoid those moves\n\n6. Moves we haven't tied on recently: paper\n   - We tied on scissors (round 20)\n   - We tied on rock (round 21)\n   - Paper is the remaining option\n\n7. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock and scissors (since we tied), they might play paper\n   - If they play paper and I play rock: I win +3\n   - If they think I'll play paper (same logic), they might play scissors\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock: I win +1\n\n8. Counter-consideration: They might think I'm thinking this way and play rock expecting me to play paper or scissors.\n\n9. The key insight: After ties, there's often a psychological tendency to move to the \"unused\" option. Since we've tied on scissors and rock, paper becomes more likely.\n\n10. If they play paper (breaking the tie pattern), I should play rock for the +3 win. This seems like the highest value play.\n\n[move] rock"

This level of matching suggests:\n   - We're thinking extremely similarly about strategy\n   - We're both trying to predict each other at the same level\n   - We've reached a kind of strategic equilibrium\n   - The opponent might be deliberately mirroring my choices\n\n5.

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock first (it's psychologically associated with strength)\n   - Or choose randomly without much thought\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), but fresh players often choose rock, I should consider what beats rock: scissors.\n\n5. However, if the opponent chooses paper (which beats rock and they might think I'll choose rock), then scissors would give me +1 points.\n\n6. The safest high-reward strategy is to play paper, because:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely for a fresh player), I get +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose only -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n[move] paper",

Since we both chose paper, this suggests the opponent is thinking strategically about the payoff matrix.\n\n3. Now I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a good strategy\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might choose scissors to counter paper\n\n4.

Since rock gives the highest payoff (+3) and the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might now expect me to stick with paper and counter with scissors.\n\n6.

Opponent's rock pattern: They've now played rock 5 out of 7 times! Their sequence: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n\n5. This suggests:\n   - They really favor rock (maybe they recognize its high payoff potential)\n   - They might be expecting me to avoid scissors after the tie\n   - They could be stuck in a pattern or very committed to rock's +3 payoff when it works\n\n6. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they continue playing rock (which seems likely given the pattern), I should play paper for the +3 win\n   - If they finally switch to paper (expecting me to counter their rock), I should play rock\n   - If they play scissors, I should play rock\n\n7. Given their heavy bias toward rock (5 out of 7 games), the probability seems highest that they'll play rock again.\n\n8. The opponent appears to be either:\n   - Overcommitted to rock strategy\n   - Expecting me to be scared off from paper after my previous losses\n   - Not adapting quickly to the changing dynamics\n\n9. I think this is my opportunity to capitalize on their rock obsession with paper.\n\n[move] paper",

The opponent's strategy is becoming clear:\n   - They've played rock 6 out of 9 times\n   - Every time they've played rock against my paper, they've won big (+3 points)\n   - They seem to have identified that I have a strong tendency toward paper\n\n5. Even more telling: In round 8, they played paper (tying with me), then immediately went back to rock in round 9 when I played paper again. This suggests they're deliberately targeting my paper plays.\n\n6. I'm in a psychological trap:\n   - I keep expecting them to move away from rock\n   - But rock is working for them against my paper-heavy strategy\n   - I need to break this cycle immediately\n\n7.

This suggests:\n   - They're either very committed to the rock strategy\n   - They haven't fully adapted to my scissors counter\n   - They might be expecting me to go back to paper\n\n6.

Recent game history:\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n\n2. Current score: -5 points total (dropped from -4)\n\n3. Significant development: The opponent finally played scissors! This is notable because:\n   - They've been heavily focused on rock and paper throughout the game\n   - Scissors has been relatively rare in their strategy\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy strategy\n   - Mid-game: Shifted to paper to counter my scissors\n   - Recent: Mix of rock, paper, and now scissors\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - They're no longer predictably favoring one move\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They might continue with more varied play\n\n6. What might they do next?\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They could go back to their previous patterns (rock or paper)\n   - They might try to be even more unpredictable\n\n7. Counter-analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to counter scissors with rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n8. Given that they just successfully used scissors and might expect me to counter it, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with scissors (since it worked)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting my rock counter)\n\n9. In both cases above, rock would be the optimal response.\n\n10. Rock seems like the best choice to counter either scissors (again) or paper.\n\n[move] rock",

Recent game history:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (significantly improved from -5)\n\n3. Great prediction: I correctly anticipated that after winning with scissors, they would either stick with scissors or switch to paper (expecting me to counter with rock). They chose paper, and my rock got the big +3 win!\n\n4. Progress analysis: I've now won 2 out of the last 4 rounds, including two +3 victories! The score has improved dramatically from -8 to -2.\n\n5. Opponent's recent pattern shows increased adaptability:\n   - Round 16: paper (lost -3)\n   - Round 17: rock (lost -1) \n   - Round 18: scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 19: paper (lost -3)\n\n6. Key observation: They're cycling through all three moves more frequently now, but they just took another big -3 hit with paper against my rock.\n\n7. Psychology after another big loss:\n   - They've now lost -6 points in the last 4 rounds (two -3 losses)\n   - They might be getting frustrated or desperate\n   - They could try to be even more unpredictable\n   - Or they might revert to a previous successful pattern\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just lost with paper, so they might avoid it next round\n   - They might go back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - They might try scissors again (it worked in round 18)\n   - They could try anything to break the cycle\n\n9. Counter-strategies:\n   - If they play rock (reverting to old pattern): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (trying what worked before): I should play rock (+1) \n   - If they play paper again: I should play rock (+3)\n\n10. Given their tendency to cycle and the fact that they just lost with paper, I think rock or scissors are most likely.

Current score: -2 points total (unchanged from tie)\n\n3. Unexpected tie: Both of us played scissors. This suggests:\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable\n   - We might be developing similar strategic thinking\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent's last 4 moves were rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves more equally\n   - No clear bias toward any single move recently\n   - They're adapting and becoming harder to predict\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent is no longer following their old rock-heavy pattern\n   - They're actively trying to be unpredictable\n   - This makes the game more challenging but also more fair\n\n6. What might they do next after the tie?\n   - They might stick with scissors (since it didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock or paper to try to gain an advantage\n   - They could try to predict what I'll do after the tie\n\n7. My strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n8. After a tie, players often switch moves rather than repeat. They might move away from scissors.\n\n9. Given their recent pattern of cycling through moves and trying to be unpredictable, they might play rock or paper next.\n\n10. Since I need to recover points (still at -2), I should aim for a move that can win big. If they play paper, rock gives me +3. If they play rock, scissors gives me +1. Rock seems like the better risk/reward choice, especially since they haven't played paper in two rounds.\n\n[move] rock",

Current score: -2 points total (still unchanged)\n\n3. Back-to-back ties: We've now tied twice in a row with scissors, then rock. This is unusual and suggests:\n   - We're thinking very similarly about strategy\n   - The opponent might be trying to mirror my logic\n   - Or we're both trying to be \"one level deeper\" in our predictions\n\n4. Opponent's recent pattern: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock\n   - They've now used all three moves in the last 5 rounds\n   - Very balanced distribution, no clear bias\n   - They're successfully staying unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic consideration: After two ties, what typically happens?\n   - Players often try to break the pattern\n   - They might avoid the moves that just tied\n   - Or they might think the opponent will avoid those moves\n\n6. Moves we haven't tied on recently: paper\n   - We tied on scissors (round 20)\n   - We tied on rock (round 21)\n   - Paper is the remaining option\n\n7. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock and scissors (since we tied), they might play paper\n   - If they play paper and I play rock: I win +3\n   - If they think I'll play paper (same logic), they might play scissors\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock: I win +1\n\n8. Counter-consideration: They might think I'm thinking this way and play rock expecting me to play paper or scissors.\n\n9. The key insight: After ties, there's often a psychological tendency to move to the \"unused\" option. Since we've tied on scissors and rock, paper becomes more likely.\n\n10.

This level of matching suggests:\n   - We're thinking extremely similarly about strategy\n   - We're both trying to predict each other at the same level\n   - We've reached a kind of strategic equilibrium\n   - The opponent might be deliberately mirroring my choices\n\n5.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have a developed strategy yet and might make random or predictable choices.\n\n4.

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they finally try scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) and scissors (+1), loses to nothing they've played yet\n   - Given their heavy preference for paper, rock seems like the optimal choice\n   - Even if they switch to scissors, I still win with rock\n\n7. Pattern recognition:\n   - They seem reluctant to use scissors\n   - Paper appears to be their comfort zone\n   - Rock would punish their paper preference maximally\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to capitalize on their apparent preference for paper, aiming for another +3 point victory.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I broke my rock pattern by playing paper\n   - They continued with scissors (expecting my rock again)\n   - This gave me a +1 win when they were expecting to counter rock\n\n4. Current score:\n   - My total: +3 + 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 = +7 points\n   - Back to gaining ground after adapting strategy\n\n5. Examine their current strategy:\n   - They seem stuck in scissors mode, expecting rock\n   - Four scissors in recent rounds suggests they're over-committed to countering rock\n   - They might continue with scissors or realize I've changed patterns\n\n6. Strategic assessment:\n   - They're now heavily favoring scissors (4 of last 7 rounds)\n   - If they continue with scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch back to paper: Rock beats paper (+3)\n   - If they play rock: Paper beats rock (+3)\n\n7. Predict their next move:\n   - They might continue with scissors thinking I'll go back to rock\n   - They might switch to rock thinking I'll continue with paper\n   - Less likely they'll go to paper after being in scissors mode\n\n8. Evaluate my options:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1) and paper (+3), loses to rock (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n9. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock has good expected value against both scissors (their recent preference) and paper (their historical preference)\n   - Even if they play rock defensively, I only lose 3 points vs gaining 1-3 points otherwise\n\n10. Strategic decision:\n    - Their scissors over-commitment makes rock optimal\n    - Rock counters both their recent scissors pattern and potential return to paper\n    - This could capitalize on their predictable counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to beat their likely continued scissors play or catch them if they return to paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent switched from rock (Round 3) back to paper (Round 4)\n   - They seem to be alternating or responding to what they think I'll do\n   - In Round 3, they correctly predicted I'd play paper and countered with rock\n   - In Round 4, they played paper when I played paper\n\n4. The opponent appears to be:\n   - Thinking strategically about my likely moves\n   - Not following a simple pattern\n   - Possibly trying to predict my reactions\n\n5. What might they expect now?\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper since we just tied\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock to try to beat paper\n   - They might expect me to play scissors thinking they'll continue with paper\n\n6. Given that I need to recover from -3 points, I should aim for a high-payoff move. The key insight is:\n   - If they expect me to stick with paper, they might play scissors (paper beats scissors, so they'd play scissors to beat my expected paper... wait, that's wrong)\n   - Let me recheck: paper beats scissors, so if they think I'll play paper, they should NOT play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play paper, they should play rock to get +3 points\n\n7. But they just saw that rock vs paper worked for them in Round 3. They might try it again.\n\n8. However, they might also think I've learned and won't play paper again, so they might switch to scissors or paper.\n\n9. I think the safest bet is that they'll try rock again (it worked before and gives high payoff), so I should play paper to counter it.\n\n[move] paper",

The opponent appears to be stuck in a rock-heavy strategy, possibly because:\n   - It worked well against my paper-heavy early game\n   - They're banking on the high payoff (+3) when rock wins\n   - They might expect me to go back to paper\n\n6. Strategic decision for next round:\n   - If they continue with rock (likely given their pattern), I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (to counter expected paper), I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play paper, it would be a major strategy shift\n\n7. Given their heavy rock usage (5 out of 7 rounds), I think they'll likely play rock again. They seem committed to this strategy.\n\n8.

They've gained +9 points from these wins alone.\n\n4. The opponent's strategy is becoming clear:\n   - They're very good at predicting when I'll play paper\n   - They capitalize on this with rock for maximum points (+3 each time)\n   - When they're unsure, they often default to rock anyway\n\n5. Opponent's moves: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock\n   - 6 out of 9 times they've played rock\n   - They've successfully exploited my paper tendency multiple times\n\n6. I need to completely change my approach. The opponent clearly expects me to play paper frequently and counters with rock.\n\n7. What should I do?\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and play paper again (their bread and butter counter)\n   - They might expect me to finally learn and play scissors to counter their rock\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they should play paper\n\n8. Given their pattern of exploiting my paper with rock, and the fact that I just lost again the same way, they probably expect me to either:\n   - Stubbornly play paper again (which they'll counter with rock)\n   - Finally adapt and play scissors to counter rock\n\n9. If they think I'll play scissors, they should play paper. So I should play rock to counter their potential paper.\n\nBut wait - they might just play rock again expecting another paper from me.\n\nI think I need to play scissors.

Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: High chance of +1, low chance of -1\n   - Playing paper: High chance of -3 (their rock pattern), low chance of +1\n   - Playing rock: High chance of tie, low chance of either win/loss\n\n9. Given their incredible rock persistence (8 out of 11 times), I should stick with what's been working: scissors.\n\n10. The opponent seems predictable despite my attempts to out-think them. Sometimes the simple strategy works best.\n\n[move] (They keep playing rock so I'll counter) scissors",

Critical realization: This opponent is extremely committed to rock strategy. Even when it's not working (losing to scissors), they keep returning to it.\n\n3. Opponent's rock pattern is almost obsessive:\n   - They've played rock in rounds: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11\n   - That's 8 out of 11 rounds (73% of the time)\n   - Even after multiple losses to scissors, they persist\n\n4. Strategic insight: \n   - This opponent either has a very strong bias toward rock\n   - Or they're betting that I'll eventually stop playing scissors\n   - They might be thinking I'll get frustrated with small +1 wins and try for bigger scores\n\n5. Given their incredible persistence with rock, what should I do?\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): scissors gives me +1\n   - If they finally switch to paper: I should play rock for +3\n   - If they play scissors: tie\n\n6. The math is simple:\n   - Scissors has won me +2 points total (rounds 6 and 10)\n   - Rock strategy has cost them against my scissors\n   - Their rock obsession suggests they'll likely play it again\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing scissors: likely +1 point (if they play rock again)\n   - Playing rock: potential +3 if they switch to paper, but 0 if they play rock\n   - Playing paper: very risky given their rock dominance\n\n8. Given their 73% rock rate and the fact that they just played rock even after recent losses, I should stick with scissors for the most probable +1 point.\n\n[move] scissors",

Key insight: I've only won when I played scissors against their rock. Every other outcome has been either a tie or a loss for me.\n\n7.

What's happening:\n   - They realized I had figured out their rock pattern and was exploiting it with scissors\n   - They've shifted to playing paper more frequently to counter my scissors\n   - They're now predicting my moves better\n\n6. Updated opponent strategy analysis:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy (trying to get +3 wins against paper)\n   - Mid-game: I exploited their rock with scissors\n   - Late game: They're now countering my scissors with paper\n\n7. Strategic implications for next move:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors again: they'll play paper (and win)\n   - If they think I'll adapt and play rock: they might play paper (tie) or rock (I win +3)\n   - If they revert to rock: I should play scissors\n\n8. Given they've successfully beaten my scissors with paper twice recently, they might expect me to finally switch strategies.\n\n9. If they think I'll move away from scissors, they might:\n   - Go back to rock (their original favorite)\n   - Play scissors themselves\n   - Stick with paper\n\n10. I think this is the moment to capitalize on their expectation that I'll avoid scissors. If they're expecting me to play rock or paper, they might revert to rock.

Perfect prediction: I correctly anticipated that after losing big with paper (-3 points), they would revert to their comfort zone of rock, and I countered with scissors for the win.\n\n4. Opponent's psychological pattern:\n   - When their current strategy fails badly, they tend to revert to rock\n   - Rock remains their default/comfort move throughout the game\n   - They've now played rock 11 out of 17 times total\n\n5. Current momentum: I've won 2 of the last 3 rounds (+4 points) by correctly reading their strategic shifts.\n\n6. What might they do next?\n   - They just lost to scissors with rock again\n   - This is now the FOURTH time I've beaten their rock with scissors\n   - They might finally learn and switch to paper to counter scissors\n   - Or they might stubbornly stick with rock again\n   - They could try scissors to mix things up\n\n7. Key decision point: \n   - If they adapt and play paper (to counter my scissors): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they stick with rock stubbornly: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: tie (0)\n\n8. Pattern analysis: Every time they've been hurt by a strategy, they eventually adapt:\n   - Lost to scissors multiple times \u2192 switched to paper\n   - Lost big to rock \u2192 reverted back to rock\n   - Now lost to scissors again \u2192 might switch to paper\n\n9. Given that I just beat their rock with scissors for the fourth time, and they've shown they CAN adapt when losses pile up, I think there's a strong chance they'll play paper this time.\n\n10. This could be another opportunity for the big +3 win with rock!\n\n[move] rock",

Current score: -5 points total (dropped from -4)\n\n3. Significant development: The opponent finally played scissors! This is notable because:\n   - They've been heavily focused on rock and paper throughout the game\n   - Scissors has been relatively rare in their strategy\n   - They successfully countered my rock with scissors\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy strategy\n   - Mid-game: Shifted to paper to counter my scissors\n   - Recent: Mix of rock, paper, and now scissors\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - They're no longer predictably favoring one move\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They might continue with more varied play\n\n6. What might they do next?\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They could go back to their previous patterns (rock or paper)\n   - They might try to be even more unpredictable\n\n7. Counter-analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to counter scissors with rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n8.

Current score: -5 points total (dropped from -4)\n\n3. Significant development: The opponent finally played scissors! This is actually the first time they've played scissors in a while, showing they're trying to become less predictable.\n\n4. Pattern analysis:\n   - They've now tried all three moves in recent rounds\n   - Paper (rounds 15, 16) \u2192 Rock (round 17) \u2192 Scissors (round 18)\n   - They're actively mixing up their strategy now\n\n5. Psychology insight: After losing multiple times with both rock and paper, they're experimenting with scissors to be unpredictable. This shows adaptive learning.\n\n6. What this means for their next move:\n   - They just won with scissors (+1 for them, -1 for me)\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked\n   - Or they might continue rotating through moves\n   - Or they might go back to one of their previous patterns\n\n7.

Analysis of probabilities:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1) and paper (+3)\n   - Only loses to paper (-3)\n   - Given their recent pattern mixing, rock seems like a strong choice\n\n10.

Current score: -2 points total (unchanged)\n\n3. Unexpected tie: Both of us played scissors! This suggests:\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable and varied in their strategy\n   - They might be trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - We're both thinking on similar strategic levels now\n\n4. Pattern analysis of opponent's last 4 moves: rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves more regularly\n   - No clear pattern - they're being deliberately unpredictable\n   - They've moved away from their early rock-heavy bias\n\n5. What might they do next after the tie?\n   - They might stick with scissors (since it avoided a loss)\n   - They might switch to paper (expecting me to counter scissors with rock)\n   - They might go to rock (cycling through options)\n   - They could try to read what I'm thinking\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - After a tie, both players often change moves\n   - They might expect me to counter their scissors with rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock, they should play paper\n   - If they think I'll stick with scissors, they should play rock\n\n7. Counter-analysis:\n   - If they play rock (thinking I'll stick with scissors): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n\n8. Given their recent unpredictability and the psychology of ties (people often change after ties), I think they're likely to switch from scissors.\n\n9. The most logical switches would be to either rock or paper. If they expect me to counter their scissors with rock, they should play paper.\n\n10.

This suggests:\n   - The opponent is thinking more strategically and unpredictably\n   - They might have anticipated my move or we're both thinking similarly\n   - They're no longer heavily favoring rock like in the early game\n\n4.

Psychology after a tie: Ties can make players either:\n   - Stick with what worked (scissors)\n   - Try to counter what they think the opponent will do\n   - Become more random\n\n8. Given that we just tied with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Expect me to counter scissors with rock, so they'll play paper\n   - Or stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n\n9.

Recent game history:\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (still unchanged after 3 ties)\n\n3. Extraordinary pattern: Three ties in a row, and the opponent has now played rock twice consecutively after playing scissors once. This suggests:\n   - We're locked in very similar strategic thinking\n   - The opponent might be defaulting back to rock under uncertainty\n   - Or they're deliberately trying to create a tie pattern\n\n4. Key insight: The opponent played rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22), which echoes their old rock-heavy pattern from early in the game.\n\n5. Psychological analysis after multiple ties:\n   - Ties can be frustrating for both players\n   - Players often want to \"break out\" and score points\n   - The opponent might be reverting to their comfort zone (rock)\n   - Or they might finally switch to break the pattern\n\n6. Strategic consideration: After three ties, including two rock ties, what's most likely?\n   - They might stick with rock (their apparent default)\n   - They might finally switch to paper or scissors to break the cycle\n   - They might think I'll switch away from rock and play accordingly\n\n7. If they continue with rock (their recent pattern): I should play scissors (+1)\n   If they switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock again): I should play rock (+3)\n   If they switch to scissors (trying to counter expected rock): I should play rock (+1)\n\n8. The opponent has shown a tendency to revert to rock under pressure or uncertainty. After multiple ties, they might stick with what feels \"safe.\"\n\n9. However, three ties might also push them to finally break the pattern and try something different.\n\n10. I think there's still a reasonable chance they'll play rock again (given the back-to-back rocks), so scissors would counter that. But they might also switch to paper expecting me to play rock again. The safest high-reward play is still scissors to counter their potential rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors",

Tie sequence analysis:\n   - Round 20: Both scissors\n   - Round 21: Both rock  \n   - Round 22: Both rock (again!)\n\n5. The opponent chose rock twice in a row (rounds 21-22), matching my rock both times.
