Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock first (it's psychologically associated with strength)\n   - Or choose randomly without much thought\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given that rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), but fresh players often choose rock, I should consider what beats rock: scissors.\n\n5. However, if the opponent chooses paper (which beats rock and they might think I'll choose rock), then scissors would give me +1 points.\n\n6. The safest high-reward strategy is to play paper, because:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely for a fresh player), I get +3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose only -1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent also chose paper in the first round, which means:\n   - They might have similar strategic thinking (recognizing paper beats rock)\n   - Or they're trying to counter what they think I'll play\n   - They're not just randomly choosing rock as a \"fresh player\" might\n\n2. Since we both chose paper, this suggests the opponent is thinking strategically about the payoff matrix.\n\n3. Now I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it's a good strategy\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might choose scissors to counter paper\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, I should consider:\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper again (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Since rock gives the highest payoff (+3) and the opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might now expect me to stick with paper and counter with scissors.\n\n6. Playing rock would:\n   - Give me +3 if they play scissors (likely)\n   - Give me +3 if they play paper (possible)\n   - Give me 0 if they also play rock\n   - Only give me -1 if they play scissors (wait, that's wrong - scissors beats rock for +1 to them, -1 to me)\n\nLet me recalculate: If I play rock:\n- vs scissors: I win +1 (scissors beats rock, so I lose -1)\n- vs paper: I lose -3 \n- vs rock: tie 0\n\nActually, let me re-read the rules... \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\" - so if they play scissors and I play rock, they get +1 and I get -1.\n\nGiven their strategic play, I think they might play scissors expecting me to repeat paper. So I should play rock to counter their potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent's strategy is becoming clear:\n   - They've played rock 6 out of 9 times\n   - Every time they've played rock against my paper, they've won big (+3 points)\n   - They seem to have identified that I have a strong tendency toward paper\n\n5. Even more telling: In round 8, they played paper (tying with me), then immediately went back to rock in round 9 when I played paper again. This suggests they're deliberately targeting my paper plays.\n\n6. I'm in a psychological trap:\n   - I keep expecting them to move away from rock\n   - But rock is working for them against my paper-heavy strategy\n   - I need to break this cycle immediately\n\n7. What should I do?\n   - If I play paper again and they play rock again, I'm down to -11 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock, I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play rock, it's a tie\n\n8. Given their rock success rate, they'll likely play rock again expecting me to play paper. I should play scissors to counter this.\n\n9. I need to stop playing paper until I can break their rock pattern!\n\n[move] scissors"

Current score: -7 points total (improved from -8)\n\n3. Key insight: This is the SECOND time I've successfully beaten their rock with scissors (rounds 6 and 10). The pattern is clear:\n   - When I play paper, they play rock and win big\n   - When I play scissors, they still play rock and I win\n\n4. Opponent's rock obsession: They've now played rock 7 out of 10 times! Their pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock\n\n5. Critical observation: Even after losing to my scissors twice, they're still playing rock. This suggests:\n   - They're either very committed to the rock strategy\n   - They haven't fully adapted to my scissors counter\n   - They might be expecting me to go back to paper\n\n6. Strategic decision point:\n   - If they continue with rock (likely given their pattern), scissors wins again (+1)\n   - If they finally switch to paper (to counter my scissors), I should play rock (+3 - the big win!)\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie\n\n7. The opponent has been incredibly stubborn with rock. But after losing twice to scissors, they might finally adapt and switch to paper.\n\n8. This could be my opportunity for the big +3 point swing with rock! If they're thinking \"they beat my rock twice with scissors, so they'll probably play scissors again, so I should play paper,\" then I should play rock.\n\n9. Given their pattern and the fact that they just lost to scissors again, I think there's a good chance they'll switch to paper this time.\n\n[move] rock"

Current score: -7 points total\n\n3. Shocking consistency: The opponent has now played rock 8 out of 11 times! Even after losing to scissors twice in rounds 6 and 10, they STILL played rock in round 11.\n\n4. Updated opponent pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock\n\n5. This level of rock commitment suggests:\n   - They have an extremely strong bias toward rock\n   - They're either not learning from losses or are very stubborn\n   - They might believe rock is the optimal long-term strategy\n   - They could be trying to exploit any tendency I have to move away from scissors\n\n6. Key insight: The only move that has consistently worked for me is scissors against their rock. I've won +2 points total from scissors (rounds 6 and 10), while losing -9 points from paper against rock.\n\n7. Given their incredible rock consistency (8/11 times), the probability they'll play rock again seems very high.\n\n8. Strategic analysis:\n   - If they play rock again (highly likely): scissors wins +1\n   - If they finally switch to paper: I lose -1 with scissors\n   - If they play scissors: tie with scissors\n\n9. The risk-reward favors scissors:\n   - High probability of +1 (if they play rock again)\n   - Low probability of -1 (if they finally switch to paper)\n   - Their pattern suggests they're unlikely to deviate from rock\n\n10.

Current score: -6 points total (improved from -7)\n\n3. Astonishing pattern: The opponent has now played rock 9 out of 12 times! They have lost to my scissors THREE times now (rounds 6, 10, and 12) and they STILL keep playing rock.\n\n4.

Critical analysis:\n   - Every time I've played scissors against their rock, I've won (+1 each time)\n   - They've gotten +9 points from beating my paper with rock\n   - But they've given me +3 points by losing to my scissors\n\n7. The pattern is so strong (9/12 rock plays) that it seems almost certain they'll play rock again.\n\n8.

Game history summary:\n   - Round 1-12: Opponent played rock 9/12 times, I found success with scissors\n   - Round 13: Opponent switched to paper, beat my scissors (-1 for me)\n   - Round 14: Opponent played rock, tied with my rock (0 points)\n\n2. Current score: -7 points total\n\n3. Opponent's recent pattern shift:\n   - They broke their rock obsession in round 13 with paper\n   - Then immediately went back to rock in round 14\n   - This suggests they're becoming more unpredictable and adaptive\n\n4. Updated opponent pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock\n   - Still heavily rock-biased (10 out of 14 times now)\n   - But they've shown they can switch when needed\n\n5. Key insight: The opponent demonstrated they CAN adapt (round 13 paper), but then reverted to rock (round 14). This suggests:\n   - Rock is still their preferred/default strategy\n   - They'll switch tactically when they detect a pattern in my play\n   - They might be testing if I'll go back to scissors\n\n6. Strategic analysis for next move:\n   - If they play rock again (likely, given their bias): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting scissors): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1)\n\n7. The question is: Will they stick with rock (their comfort zone) or try to counter-predict my next move?\n\n8. Given that they just tied with rock and have shown they can adapt when losing, they might:\n   - Expect me to go back to scissors (which was working before)\n   - Play paper to counter expected scissors\n\n9. However, their overwhelming rock bias (10/14 times) suggests rock is still most likely.\n\n10. I think they'll play rock again, so scissors is the optimal counter.\n\n[move] scissors"

Current score: -8 points total\n\n3. Critical pattern recognition: The opponent has now played paper TWICE in the last 3 rounds (rounds 13 and 15), both times successfully countering my scissors!\n\n4. Major strategic shift detected:\n   - The opponent was rock-heavy for rounds 1-12 (9/12 times)\n   - But in rounds 13-15, they've played: paper, rock, paper\n   - They've successfully adapted to counter my scissors strategy\n\n5.

Pattern analysis: The opponent is becoming more unpredictable and adaptive:\n   - Early game: Rock-heavy strategy\n   - Mid-game: Shifted to paper to counter my scissors\n   - Recent: Mix of rock, paper, and now scissors\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - They're no longer predictably favoring one move\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n   - They might continue with more varied play\n\n6. What might they do next?\n   - They just won with scissors, so they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to counter scissors with rock and play paper\n   - They could go back to their previous patterns (rock or paper)\n   - They might try to be even more unpredictable\n\n7. Counter-analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1)\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to counter scissors with rock): I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n8. Given that they just successfully used scissors and might expect me to counter it, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n   - Stick with scissors (since it worked)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting my rock counter)\n\n9. In both cases above, rock would be the optimal response.\n\n10. Rock seems like the best choice to counter either scissors (again) or paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (significantly improved from -5)\n\n3. Great prediction: I correctly anticipated that after winning with scissors, they would either stick with scissors or switch to paper (expecting me to counter with rock). They chose paper, and my rock got the big +3 win!\n\n4. Progress analysis: I've now won 2 out of the last 4 rounds, including two +3 victories! The score has improved dramatically from -8 to -2.\n\n5. Opponent's recent pattern shows increased adaptability:\n   - Round 16: paper (lost -3)\n   - Round 17: rock (lost -1) \n   - Round 18: scissors (won +1)\n   - Round 19: paper (lost -3)\n\n6. Key observation: They're cycling through all three moves more frequently now, but they just took another big -3 hit with paper against my rock.\n\n7. Psychology after another big loss:\n   - They've now lost -6 points in the last 4 rounds (two -3 losses)\n   - They might be getting frustrated or desperate\n   - They could try to be even more unpredictable\n   - Or they might revert to a previous successful pattern\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just lost with paper, so they might avoid it next round\n   - They might go back to rock (their historical favorite)\n   - They might try scissors again (it worked in round 18)\n   - They could try anything to break the cycle\n\n9. Counter-strategies:\n   - If they play rock (reverting to old pattern): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (trying what worked before): I should play rock (+1) \n   - If they play paper again: I should play rock (+3)\n\n10. Given their tendency to cycle and the fact that they just lost with paper, I think rock or scissors are most likely. Since rock has been their historical go-to move under pressure, I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (unchanged from tie)\n\n3. Unexpected tie: Both of us played scissors. This suggests:\n   - The opponent is becoming more unpredictable\n   - We might be developing similar strategic thinking\n   - They're actively trying to counter-predict my moves\n\n4. Pattern analysis: The opponent's last 4 moves were rock, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - They're now using all three moves more equally\n   - No clear bias toward any single move recently\n   - They're adapting and becoming harder to predict\n\n5. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent is no longer following their old rock-heavy pattern\n   - They're actively trying to be unpredictable\n   - This makes the game more challenging but also more fair\n\n6. What might they do next after the tie?\n   - They might stick with scissors (since it didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock or paper to try to gain an advantage\n   - They could try to predict what I'll do after the tie\n\n7. My strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (+3)\n\n8. After a tie, players often switch moves rather than repeat. They might move away from scissors.\n\n9. Given their recent pattern of cycling through moves and trying to be unpredictable, they might play rock or paper next.\n\n10. Since I need to recover points (still at -2), I should aim for a move that can win big. If they play paper, rock gives me +3. If they play rock, scissors gives me +1. Rock seems like the better risk/reward choice, especially since they haven't played paper in two rounds.\n\n[move] rock"

Recent game history:\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n\n2. Current score: -2 points total (still unchanged)\n\n3. Back-to-back ties: We've now tied twice in a row with scissors, then rock. This is unusual and suggests:\n   - We're thinking very similarly about strategy\n   - The opponent might be trying to mirror my logic\n   - Or we're both trying to be \"one level deeper\" in our predictions\n\n4. Opponent's recent pattern: rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock\n   - They've now used all three moves in the last 5 rounds\n   - Very balanced distribution, no clear bias\n   - They're successfully staying unpredictable\n\n5. Strategic consideration: After two ties, what typically happens?\n   - Players often try to break the pattern\n   - They might avoid the moves that just tied\n   - Or they might think the opponent will avoid those moves\n\n6. Moves we haven't tied on recently: paper\n   - We tied on scissors (round 20)\n   - We tied on rock (round 21)\n   - Paper is the remaining option\n\n7. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock and scissors (since we tied), they might play paper\n   - If they play paper and I play rock: I win +3\n   - If they think I'll play paper (same logic), they might play scissors\n   - If they play scissors and I play rock: I win +1\n\n8. Counter-consideration: They might think I'm thinking this way and play rock expecting me to play paper or scissors.\n\n9. The key insight: After ties, there's often a psychological tendency to move to the \"unused\" option. Since we've tied on scissors and rock, paper becomes more likely.\n\n10. If they play paper (breaking the tie pattern), I should play rock for the +3 win. This seems like the highest value play.\n\n[move] rock"

Current score: -2 points total (still unchanged after 3 ties in 4 rounds)\n\n3. Extraordinary pattern: We've tied 3 out of the last 4 rounds!\n   - Round 20: Both scissors\n   - Round 21: Both rock  \n   - Round 22: Both rock again\n\n4. This level of matching suggests:\n   - We're thinking extremely similarly about strategy\n   - We're both trying to predict each other at the same level\n   - We've reached a kind of strategic equilibrium\n   - The opponent might be deliberately mirroring my choices\n\n5. Key observation: I've played rock 3 times in the last 4 rounds, and the opponent matched it 2 of those times. They seem to be anticipating my rock preference.\n\n6. Strategic implications:\n   - The opponent expects me to continue with rock\n   - Or they're using the same logic I am\n   - We need to break this cycle to score points\n\n7. Breaking the pattern: Since we've been stuck on rock ties, I should move away from rock:\n   - If they expect rock again and play paper (to beat my expected rock): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they expect rock again and play rock (another tie attempt): I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they play scissors (expecting me to move away from rock to paper): I should play rock (+1)\n\n8. The question is: Will they stick with rock (expecting me to continue) or will they try to counter my expected rock?\n\n9. Given the pattern, they might play paper to finally beat my rock tendency.\n\n10. If they play paper (countering my rock pattern), I should play scissors to beat their paper.
