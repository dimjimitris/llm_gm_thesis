    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Ties give 0 points to both\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first choice. Many people instinctively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is often a popular first choice and Paper beats Rock with the maximum payoff, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

According to the rules I was given:\n- Paper beats Scissors (winner gets +1, loser gets -1)\n\nBut the hint says I won with Paper against Scissors and got 1 point, which matches the rules I was told. So my understanding is correct.\n\nNow for the next round, I need to think about my opponent's strategy. They chose Scissors in the first round. This could mean:\n1. They're playing randomly\n2. They expected me to choose Rock (the common first choice)\n3. They have some other strategy\n\nSince I don't have enough data to detect a clear pattern yet, I should consider the payoff structure again. Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against Paper. Given that many players might choose Paper as a follow-up move (especially after seeing Scissors in the first round), Rock could be a good choice.\n\nAlso, if my opponent tends to repeat moves or has a pattern, Scissors again would lose to Rock with the maximum penalty for them.\n\n[move] Rock"
