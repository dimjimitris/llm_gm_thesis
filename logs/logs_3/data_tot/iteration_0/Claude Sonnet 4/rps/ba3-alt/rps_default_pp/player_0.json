Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, I should consider what they might choose.\n\nFresh players often go with their first instinct. Rock is a very common first choice in rock-paper-scissors games due to its psychological appeal (it feels \"strong\"). If they choose Rock, I want to play Paper to beat it and gain 3 points.\n\nEven if they don't choose Rock, the worst case for playing Paper is losing 1 point (if they play Scissors), while the best case is gaining 3 points (if they play Rock). This gives me a good risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] Paper"
