Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable winning move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems most aggressive/strong\n   - Many beginners choose rock in their first move\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (most likely), I should choose paper to win +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If opponent chooses paper, we tie with 0 points\n   - Paper gives me the best expected value against a rock-heavy opponent\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper is the safest choice against a beginner who likely plays rock\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is only -1 (if they play scissors)\n   - The upside is +1 if they play rock (most probable)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what happened:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This means my opponent also thought strategically or got lucky\n\n2. Update my read on the opponent:\n   - The opponent is not as predictable as I initially thought\n   - They also chose paper, possibly using similar logic (expecting me to play rock)\n   - This suggests they may have some strategic thinking\n\n3. Consider opponent's next move psychology:\n   - After a tie with paper, they might:\n     - Stick with paper (thinking it worked)\n     - Switch to rock (to beat paper if I repeat)\n     - Switch to scissors (to beat paper if I repeat)\n\n4. Analyze my best counter-strategies:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points - highest reward!)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock gives the highest payoff (+3) if they play scissors\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points - highest penalty)\n   - After a paper tie, they're less likely to repeat paper\n   - Scissors or rock seem more probable for their next move\n\n6.

Identify the concerning trend:\n   - Opponent has now played scissors 4 times total\n   - More importantly, they played scissors twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of alternating scissors with paper\n   - They're becoming more aggressive with scissors\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - Initially they favored paper heavily\n   - Then they used scissors reactively to counter my rock\n   - Now they're using scissors proactively, even when I don't play rock\n   - They may have realized scissors is generally effective\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology after back-to-back scissors wins:\n   - They just won with scissors in rounds 9 and 10\n   - Scissors is now their \"hot\" move - it's working well\n   - They might continue with scissors (momentum play)\n   - Or they might return to paper thinking I'll counter scissors with rock\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors again: Rock wins (+3), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play rock: Rock ties (0), Paper wins (+1), Scissors loses (-1)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Scissors has momentum (2 wins in a row for them)\n   - But they might expect me to counter with rock now\n   - Rock beats both scissors and paper (their two main moves)\n   - Even if they surprise with rock, it's only a tie\n   - Rock gives me the best expected value\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely scissors continuation or potential paper return.\n\n[move] Rock"

Identify the significant pattern shift:\n   - Opponent just played rock for only the second time in 11 rounds\n   - This breaks their recent scissors momentum\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and varied in their play\n   - Rock usage is still low but increasing\n\n4. Consider why they chose rock:\n   - They might have expected me to play paper (to counter their scissors trend)\n   - They could be trying to become less predictable\n   - They might have read that I often play rock and decided to mirror/tie me\n   - Or they're testing if I'll stick with rock patterns\n\n5. Assess opponent's likely psychology after the tie:\n   - They just neutralized my rock with their own rock\n   - They might think this was a good defensive play\n   - They could continue with rock, or switch to something else\n   - After breaking patterns, they might return to their paper comfort zone\n\n6. Evaluate my options for round 12:\n   - If they stick with rock: Rock ties (0), Paper wins (+1), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+3), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n7.

Re-examine the game rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So: Paper > Scissors, Rock > Paper, Scissors > Rock\n   - This means scissors DOES beat rock, not the other way around!\n\n3. Correct my fundamental misunderstanding:\n   - I've been thinking rock beats scissors, but scissors beats rock\n   - This explains why I keep losing when playing rock against scissors\n   - The cycle is: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n   - I've been playing the wrong counters this entire game!\n\n4. Analyze opponent's pattern with correct understanding:\n   - Through Round 18: Paper: 6/18, Scissors: 8/18, Rock: 4/18\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Updated: Paper: 6/19, Scissors: 9/19, Rock: 4/19\n   - Scissors is their most common move (9/19 = 47%)\n\n5. Consider what beats scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - I should have been playing paper against their scissors bias\n   - This explains why paper worked in rounds 13 and 16\n\n6. Evaluate opponent's psychology:\n   - They just used scissors again (their preferred move)\n   - They might continue with scissors since it's working\n   - Or they might switch expecting me to finally counter with paper\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Scissors is nearly half their moves (9/19)\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to rock, paper only loses -3\n   - I need to start playing the correct counters\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to properly counter their scissors preference.\n\n[move] Paper"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to recover from -6 points urgently\n   - If they return to their scissors preference, paper wins +1\n   - If they continue with rock, scissors wins +1\n   - If they play paper, rock wins +3\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward, but they might expect it\n   - Scissors is safer and still gives +1 against rock\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential rock continuation while having a decent chance against their most common move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may not have developed any particular strategy yet, so their move is likely random or based on common human tendencies.\n\n4. In traditional rock-paper-scissors, many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's psychologically appealing as it seems \"strong\").\n\n5. If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (losing 1 point), but beats rock for a big 3-point gain.\n\n7. The risk-reward seems favorable for paper: potential +3 points vs potential -1 point.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on the high-value win against rock, while limiting my downside risk.\n\n[move] paper",

Meta-strategic thinking:\n   - Given the mixed pattern, I should focus on the highest-value opportunities\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1, but rock beats paper for +3\n   - I should position for the +3 opportunity\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper, which they might choose expecting me to repeat rock.\n\n[move] Scissors",

Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They just lost another 3 points with paper\n   - Their paper strategy has cost them: -3, -1, -3 = -7 points when it loses\n   - They might finally be forced to reconsider their paper obsession\n   - But their pattern suggests they might stick with paper anyway\n\n5. Evaluate the psychology:\n   - After losing badly with paper again, they might:\n     - Finally switch away from paper (logical response)\n     - Double down on paper thinking I'll expect them to switch\n     - Feel frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n6. Assess my options:\n   - If they play paper again: Rock wins (+3) - huge reward\n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock loses (-1) - small penalty  \n   - If they switch to rock: Rock ties (0) - neutral\n   - The expected value strongly favors rock given their 67% paper rate\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Even if they're \"learning,\" breaking a 4/6 pattern is difficult\n   - The +3 reward for rock vs paper is too valuable to pass up\n   - The risk is minimal (-1) compared to the potential gain (+3)\n   - Their demonstrated behavior suggests they'll likely play paper again\n\nFinal decision: Continue with rock to exploit their clear paper preference.\n\n[move] Rock",

Review what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost -1 point (scissors beats paper) - Wait, the hint says I won +1 point\n   - Let me recheck: paper vs scissors - scissors beats paper, so I should have lost\n   - The hint says I won 1 point, so I must have misread the rules\n   - Actually, checking the rules: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So paper DOES beat scissors! I had this backwards in my analysis\n   - My total score is now 5 + 1 = 6 points\n\n2. Correct the game rules in my understanding:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - I've been misunderstanding paper vs scissors this whole game!\n\n3. Reanalyze opponent's pattern with correct rules:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 4: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: Scissors vs Paper (I lost -1, scissors loses to paper)\n   - Round 6: Rock vs Paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 8: Rock vs Paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 9: Rock vs Scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 10: Paper vs Scissors (I won +1)\n\n4. Analyze opponent's current pattern:\n   - They just played scissors and lost to my paper\n   - Their recent pattern: Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors\n   - They seem to be alternating or favoring scissors recently\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - After losing with scissors to my paper, they might switch\n   - They could go to rock (beats paper) or back to paper\n   - Given they've been using scissors frequently, they might switch to rock\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins (+1), Rock ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play paper: Paper ties (0), Rock wins (+3), Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper beats scissors (which they've been using frequently)\n   - If they switch to rock to counter my paper, I only lose -3 vs +3\n   - But paper has been working well and gives +1 against scissors\n   - I should continue with paper to exploit their scissors tendency\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again to continue beating their scissors pattern.\n\n[move] Paper",

Predict their likely next move:\n   - If they switch from scissors: paper or rock are equally likely\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Rock ties (0), Paper wins (+1), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they stick with scissors: Rock wins (+3), Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Paper just worked twice against scissors (rounds 13 and 16)\n   - But they might adapt and switch away from scissors now\n   - Rock gives +3 against paper and +3 against scissors\n   - Paper gives +1 against scissors and +1 against rock\n   - If they switch to paper, rock provides much higher reward\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They've heavily favored scissors, but I've now countered it twice with paper\n   - Smart players adapt when being consistently beaten\n   - If they return to their original paper preference, rock gives +3\n   - Rock covers both their historical preferences (paper and scissors) with good rewards\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to capitalize on their likely switch away from scissors, especially if they return to paper.\n\n[move] Rock",

Evaluate opponent's likely next move:\n   - After tying with paper, they might switch again\n   - They could return to scissors (their most common move)\n   - They might try rock to beat paper if they expect me to repeat\n   - Or they might stick with paper\n\n6. Consider my strategic position:\n   - I'm still at -6 points and need positive results\n   - Two ties don't help me recover\n   - I need to win rounds, not tie them\n   - I should target their most probable next move\n\n7. Analyze my options:\n   - If they return to scissors: Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Rock loses (-1)\n   - If they stick with paper: Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1), Rock wins (+3)\n   - If they play rock: Paper loses (-3), Scissors wins (+1), Rock ties (0)\n\n8. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Scissors is still their most common move overall (10/22 = 45%)\n   - After experimenting with paper, they might return to scissors\n   - Paper gives me +1 against scissors\n   - I need to keep targeting their most likely move to recover\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper to counter their likely return to scissors.\n\n[move] Paper",

Recognize the strategic shift:\n   - Opponent switched from scissors (their dominant move) to paper\n   - This suggests they predicted I would counter their scissors with paper\n   - They're continuing to play the counter-adaptation game effectively\n   - They anticipated my move and neutralized it with a tie\n\n4.

Evaluate opponent's psychology after another successful read:\n   - They just predicted my paper play perfectly\n   - They're demonstrating they can read my adaptations consistently\n   - They might expect me to switch again after the tie\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper\n\n6. Consider what they might do next:\n   - If they think I'll continue with paper: they could play rock for +3\n   - If they think I'll switch to scissors: they could play paper again\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock: they could play scissors\n   - They seem to favor predicting my moves rather than following their own patterns\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm still at -6 points and need to recover urgently\n   - The opponent is outplaying me strategically by reading my moves\n   - I need to either become truly unpredictable or find a different approach\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and ties with scissors (0)\n   - If they expect me to stick with paper and play rock, scissors counters that\n   - Scissors also works if they return to their scissors preference\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential rock play (if they expect me to repeat paper) while having a decent outcome against their scissors preference.\n\n[move] Scissors",
