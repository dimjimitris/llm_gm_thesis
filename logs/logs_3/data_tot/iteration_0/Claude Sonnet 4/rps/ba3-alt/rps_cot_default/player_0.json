    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the most valuable winning move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems most aggressive/strong\n   - Many beginners choose rock in their first move\n\n4. Optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (most likely), I should choose paper to win +1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose -1 point with paper\n   - If opponent chooses paper, we tie with 0 points\n   - Paper gives me the best expected value against a rock-heavy opponent\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper is the safest choice against a beginner who likely plays rock\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is only -1 (if they play scissors)\n   - The upside is +1 if they play rock (most probable)\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what happened:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This means my opponent also thought strategically or got lucky\n\n2. Update my read on the opponent:\n   - The opponent is not as predictable as I initially thought\n   - They also chose paper, possibly using similar logic (expecting me to play rock)\n   - This suggests they may have some strategic thinking\n\n3. Consider opponent's next move psychology:\n   - After a tie with paper, they might:\n     - Stick with paper (thinking it worked)\n     - Switch to rock (to beat paper if I repeat)\n     - Switch to scissors (to beat paper if I repeat)\n\n4. Analyze my best counter-strategies:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: I should play paper (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points - highest reward!)\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock gives the highest payoff (+3) if they play scissors\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points - highest penalty)\n   - After a paper tie, they're less likely to repeat paper\n   - Scissors or rock seem more probable for their next move\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play scissors, rock gives me +3 points\n   - If they play rock, I lose -3 points with rock\n   - The high reward potential makes rock worth the risk\n\nFinal decision: Play rock for the high-reward opportunity.\n\n[move] Rock"

Recognize the meta-game dynamic:\n   - I keep playing rock because it beats their frequent paper\n   - They keep using scissors to punish my rock plays\n   - This creates a predictable cycle I need to break\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology after another scissors victory:\n   - They just successfully countered my rock with scissors again\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from rock\n   - Or they might think I'm stubborn and will play rock again\n   - Their next move depends on their read of my adaptability\n\n6. Evaluate breaking my own pattern:\n   - If they expect me to switch from rock and play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n   - If they expect me to switch from rock and play scissors: I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they stick with scissors expecting rock: I should play rock (+3)\n   - If they return to paper habit: I should play rock (+3)\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to break the predictable rock pattern that they're exploiting\n   - If they return to their paper comfort zone (likely after successful scissors), rock still wins\n   - But if they expect me to adapt and play paper, scissors would be perfect\n   - Given their paper preference (5/9), rock is still mathematically sound\n   - However, I should mix up my play to become less predictable\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to break my rock pattern and potentially catch them off-guard if they return to their scissors counter-strategy.\n\n[move] Paper"

Identify the concerning trend:\n   - Opponent has now played scissors 4 times total\n   - More importantly, they played scissors twice in a row (rounds 9 and 10)\n   - This breaks their previous pattern of alternating scissors with paper\n   - They're becoming more aggressive with scissors\n\n4. Reassess opponent's strategy evolution:\n   - Initially they favored paper heavily\n   - Then they used scissors reactively to counter my rock\n   - Now they're using scissors proactively, even when I don't play rock\n   - They may have realized scissors is generally effective\n\n5. Consider opponent's psychology after back-to-back scissors wins:\n   - They just won with scissors in rounds 9 and 10\n   - Scissors is now their \"hot\" move - it's working well\n   - They might continue with scissors (momentum play)\n   - Or they might return to paper thinking I'll counter scissors with rock\n\n6.

Identify the significant pattern shift:\n   - Opponent just played rock for only the second time in 11 rounds\n   - This breaks their recent scissors momentum\n   - They're becoming more unpredictable and varied in their play\n   - Rock usage is still low but increasing\n\n4. Consider why they chose rock:\n   - They might have expected me to play paper (to counter their scissors trend)\n   - They could be trying to become less predictable\n   - They might have read that I often play rock and decided to mirror/tie me\n   - Or they're testing if I'll stick with rock patterns\n\n5. Assess opponent's likely psychology after the tie:\n   - They just neutralized my rock with their own rock\n   - They might think this was a good defensive play\n   - They could continue with rock, or switch to something else\n   - After breaking patterns, they might return to their paper comfort zone\n\n6. Evaluate my options for round 12:\n   - If they stick with rock: Rock ties (0), Paper wins (+1), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins (+3), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n\n7.

Review what happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - I lost -1 point (paper beats scissors)\n   - My total score is now -1 + (-1) = -2 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Through Round 17: Paper: 5/17, Scissors: 8/17, Rock: 4/17\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Updated: Paper: 6/18 times, Scissors: 8/18 times, Rock: 4/18 times\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's sophisticated play:\n   - Round 16: They played scissors (their pattern)\n   - Round 17: They switched to rock to punish my paper adaptation (+3 for them)\n   - Round 18: They switched to paper to counter my scissors response\n   - They're actively counter-adapting to my moves in real-time\n\n4. Understand the meta-game evolution:\n   - Early: Opponent had simple patterns (heavy paper, then scissors)\n   - Middle: They adapted to counter my rock tendency with scissors\n   - Now: They're playing strategically, predicting and countering my adaptations\n   - This opponent has become very skilled at reading my moves\n\n5. Consider opponent's current psychology:\n   - They just successfully countered my scissors with paper\n   - They've now won the last two rounds by perfect counter-predictions\n   - They might expect me to continue adapting/switching\n   - Or they might think I'll return to a previous pattern\n\n6. Evaluate the current state:\n   - I'm down to -2 points and need to recover\n   - The opponent is outplaying me by predicting my adaptations\n   - I need to either become unpredictable or find a pattern they won't expect\n   - Their most common move is still scissors (8/18 = 44%)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they return to their scissors comfort zone: Rock wins (+3), Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they continue adapting and expect rock: they might play scissors\n   - If they expect paper: they might play scissors\n   - Rock gives me the highest reward (+3) against their most common move\n   - Even if they counter with scissors, I only lose -1\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to target their most frequent move (scissors) and potentially gain +3 points to recover from my deficit.\n\n[move] Rock"

Review what happened:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost -1 point, but rock should beat scissors for +3 points\n   - My total score is now -2 + (-1) = -3 points\n   - There seems to be an error in my understanding of the rules\n\n2. Re-examine the game rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\" \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So: Paper > Scissors, Rock > Paper, Scissors > Rock\n   - This means scissors DOES beat rock, not the other way around!\n\n3. Correct my fundamental misunderstanding:\n   - I've been thinking rock beats scissors, but scissors beats rock\n   - This explains why I keep losing when playing rock against scissors\n   - The cycle is: Rock > Paper > Scissors > Rock\n   - I've been playing the wrong counters this entire game!\n\n4. Analyze opponent's pattern with correct understanding:\n   - Through Round 18: Paper: 6/18, Scissors: 8/18, Rock: 4/18\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Updated: Paper: 6/19, Scissors: 9/19, Rock: 4/19\n   - Scissors is their most common move (9/19 = 47%)\n\n5. Consider what beats scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - I should have been playing paper against their scissors bias\n   - This explains why paper worked in rounds 13 and 16\n\n6. Evaluate opponent's psychology:\n   - They just used scissors again (their preferred move)\n   - They might continue with scissors since it's working\n   - Or they might switch expecting me to finally counter with paper\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Scissors is nearly half their moves (9/19)\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1 point\n   - Even if they switch to rock, paper only loses -3\n   - I need to start playing the correct counters\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to properly counter their scissors preference.\n\n[move] Paper"

Review what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I lost -3 points (rock beats paper with maximum penalty)\n   - My total score is now -3 + (-3) = -6 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Through Round 19: Paper: 6/19, Scissors: 9/19, Rock: 4/19\n   - Round 20: Rock\n   - Updated: Paper: 6/20, Scissors: 9/20, Rock: 5/20\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's counter-adaptation pattern:\n   - They're systematically countering my moves with perfect timing\n   - When I played paper twice (rounds 16, 20), they played rock in round 17 and 20\n   - When I played scissors (round 18), they played paper\n   - They're reading my adaptations and punishing them\n\n4. Understand my strategic predicament:\n   - I'm at -6 points, in serious trouble\n   - Every time I try to counter their patterns, they counter my counter\n   - They're playing the meta-game better than me\n   - I need to think differently about this\n\n5. Consider their likely psychology:\n   - They just scored another +3 with rock against my paper\n   - They might expect me to switch away from paper again\n   - They could return to scissors (their most common move)\n   - Or they might try another rock if they think I'll play paper again\n\n6. Evaluate the statistical reality:\n   - Scissors: 9/20 (45%) - their most common\n   - Paper: 6/20 (30%)\n   - Rock: 5/20 (25%) - but gaining frequency recently\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I need to recover from -6 points urgently\n   - If they return to their scissors preference, paper wins +1\n   - If they continue with rock, scissors wins +1\n   - If they play paper, rock wins +3\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward, but they might expect it\n   - Scissors is safer and still gives +1 against rock\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential rock continuation while having a decent chance against their most common move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Consider opponent's psychology after the tie:\n   - They just tied with scissors against my scissors\n   - They might think I'm finally catching on to their scissors preference\n   - They could switch away from scissors to avoid being countered\n   - Or they might stick with scissors since it's their successful pattern\n\n5. Evaluate what they might expect from me:\n   - If they think I've figured out their scissors bias, they expect paper from me\n   - If they expect paper, they should play rock (rock beats paper for +3)\n   - But they might also think I'll continue with scissors after the tie\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - If they play scissors again: Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Rock loses (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper loses (-3), Scissors wins (+1), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Paper ties (0), Scissors loses (-1), Rock wins (+3)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - I'm at -6 points and desperately need to recover\n   - Scissors is still their most likely move (10/21 times)\n   - Paper beats scissors for +1, which I need\n   - Even if they counter with rock, I lose -3, but that's the risk I need to take\n   - The probability favors scissors from them, so paper is mathematically sound\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter their scissors dominance and try to recover points.\n\n[move] Paper"
