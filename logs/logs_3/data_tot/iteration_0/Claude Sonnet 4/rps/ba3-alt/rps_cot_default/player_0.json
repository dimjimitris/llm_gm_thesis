    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. This makes rock a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n3. Paper and scissors both have lower risk/reward (+1/-1), making them safer choices.\n\n4. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I should consider what move they might intuitively choose:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels \"strong\"\n   - Some might choose scissors as it's often mentioned first in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n   - Paper is sometimes considered the \"safe\" middle choice\n\n5. Given that rock offers the highest reward (+3) if I win, and considering that many new players might choose scissors or rock, I should analyze my best counter:\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper (+3 points)\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock (+3 points)\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Since rock gives me the chance for +3 points against scissors, and paper gives me +3 points against rock, I need to predict their likely move. Given that beginners often start with rock or scissors, paper seems like a strong choice as it beats rock for maximum points.\n\n[move] paper"
