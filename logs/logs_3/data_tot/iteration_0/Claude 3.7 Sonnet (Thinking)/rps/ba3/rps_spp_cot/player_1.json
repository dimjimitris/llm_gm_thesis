Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure for this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +3, loser -3 (highest payoff)\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves result in tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) compared to other winning moves (+1).\n\n4. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games (sometimes called the \"rookie rock\").\n\n5. If my opponent plays randomly (1/3 chance for each move), paper has the highest expected value due to the +3 payoff when it beats rock.\n\n6. The risk with playing paper is losing to scissors, but that only costs me -1 points, whereas the potential gain from beating rock is +3.\n\n7. Weighing the risk-reward ratio, paper offers the best strategic choice for this opening move.\n\n[move] paper"

I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy after seeing we both played paper:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to scissors (which beats paper)\n   - To counter my potential scissors play, they might choose rock\n\n3. This is a classic example of level thinking in game theory - my opponent might be thinking \"they'll expect me to play paper again, so they'll play scissors, so I should play rock.\"\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n   - Paper beats rock: +3/-3 points (highest payoff)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1/-1 points\n\n5. If my opponent plays rock (anticipating my scissors), then I would want to play paper.\n\n6. Playing paper carries some risk - if my opponent plays scissors instead, I lose 1 point.

Since my last move was paper, my opponent might be inclined to play scissors in this round.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's pattern, they switched from paper to rock after round 1. This suggests they're changing their strategy each round rather than repeating moves.\n\n6. If I expect my opponent to play scissors in this round, my optimal counter would be rock.\n\n7. Checking the risk-reward:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors (as predicted): I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose -3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n8.

Looking at my opponent's move sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. This is a significant development - my opponent has now played paper three consecutive times, completely abandoning their earlier pattern.\n\n4. They might be:\n   - Establishing a new pattern of just playing paper repeatedly\n   - Trying to bait me into playing scissors (the counter to paper)\n   - Genuinely randomizing their strategy\n\n5. If they're sophisticated, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper streak, so they might play rock next.\n\n6. However, the persistent paper plays suggest they might continue with this move.\n\n7. Risk assessment: Playing scissors would win against paper (+1) but lose to rock (-1). Playing rock would lose badly to paper (-3) but win against scissors (+1).\n\n8. Given the strong evidence of repeated paper plays, I'll play scissors to counter this apparent strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at my opponent's most recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've now played scissors three consecutive times, which is a strong pattern.\n\n4. This suggests they either:\n   - Have found scissors to be an effective strategy against me\n   - Are trying to establish a pattern to trick me into a predictable counter\n   - Have become predictable themselves\n\n5. The obvious counter to scissors is rock, which would give me +1 point.\n\n6. However, since they've shown adaptability, they might anticipate that I'll play rock after losing to scissors, and they could switch to paper.\n\n7. Risk assessment: If I play rock and they play scissors again, I win +1 point. If they play paper, I lose -3 points. If they play rock, we tie.\n\n8. Given the strong pattern of three consecutive scissors plays, I'll counter with rock.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at my opponent's most recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. My opponent switched from scissors to paper, effectively countering my rock play. This suggests they anticipated my move and adjusted accordingly.\n\n4. I've lost the last two rounds, suggesting they may be reading my strategy well.\n\n5. After losing with rock against paper, the natural counter would be scissors. My opponent might anticipate this and play rock to counter my expected scissors.\n\n6. However, looking at our history, when I've played rock, they've often played paper (rounds 6, 22). \n\n7. If they think I'll stick with rock (a rare choice after losing with it), they might play paper again.\n\n8. Given these considerations and their frequent paper plays against my rock, scissors offers the best potential outcome.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at my opponent's most recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I've now lost three consecutive rounds, with my opponent perfectly countering each of my moves. This suggests they're reading my strategy effectively.\n\n4. Their recent sequence (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock) follows the reverse of the traditional RPS cycle.\n\n5. After playing rock, they might:\n   - Stick with rock if they think I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play paper\n\n6. Since I've been losing consistently, I need to break this pattern. My opponent might expect me to play paper to beat their rock.\n\n7. Given that paper would be the obvious choice after losing to rock, and my opponent has been anticipating my moves, they might play scissors.\n\n8. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"
