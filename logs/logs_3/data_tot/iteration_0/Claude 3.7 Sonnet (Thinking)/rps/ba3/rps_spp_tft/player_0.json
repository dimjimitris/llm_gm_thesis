    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The key difference from standard RPS is the asymmetric rewards:\n- Paper beats Rock: +3/-3 points (high stakes)\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1/-1 points (lower stakes)\n- Scissors beats Paper: +1/-1 points (lower stakes)\n- Same moves: 0/0 points (tie)\n\nThis creates an interesting dynamic where Paper is both the highest reward and highest risk move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no historical data to work with. In standard RPS, people often lead with Rock as their first move due to its perceived strength and stability.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the asymmetric payoffs, we need to weigh risk versus reward. If our opponent chooses Rock first (a common opening move), Paper would give us +3 points. If they choose Paper, Scissors would give us +1. If they choose Scissors, Rock would give us +1.\n\nGame Theorist: The Paper strategy has the highest potential reward but also the highest risk. Since we have no information about our opponent yet, we should consider balancing opportunity with protection.\n\nPattern Analyst: For a first move against an unknown opponent, I'd recommend either Paper (aggressive, high reward strategy) or Rock (moderate, slightly safer option).\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's go with Paper. The potential upside is significant, and many players do start with Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Now we need to predict how they might adjust their strategy.\n\nPattern Analyst: After losing significantly (-3 points), most players tend to change their move. The opponent likely won't play Rock again immediately. They might expect us to play Paper again (since it worked) and counter with Scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: This is where the psychology becomes important. Since we won with Paper, the opponent might anticipate us using Paper again and choose Scissors to counter. Alternatively, they might play Paper themselves, expecting us to switch to Rock after our success.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they'll switch to Scissors to counter our previous Paper, we should play Rock. If we believe they'll switch to Paper expecting us to play Rock, we should play Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyst: In RPS psychology, there's a common pattern called \"beat the previous winner\" where players choose the move that would have beaten their opponent's last move. If they follow this, they'd play Scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that analysis, I recommend playing Rock for this round. It protects against the likely Scissors play while only risking a -3 if they play Paper (which seems less likely based on psychological patterns).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Playing Rock is the optimal move here if we predict they'll try to counter our previous winning move with Scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at their moves (Rock then Scissors), they might be cycling through the standard RPS sequence: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper. If that's the case, they would play Paper next.\n\nDecision Strategist: Another possibility is they're playing reactively. After losing to Paper with Rock, they played Scissors (which would beat Paper). After losing to Rock with Scissors, they might play Paper (which would beat Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Both analyses converge on the same prediction: they're likely to play Paper next. The optimal counter to Paper would be Scissors, giving us a +1 point win.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's always the possibility they'll try to be unpredictable and break the pattern, but based on the available data, Scissors offers the best expected value.\n\nDecision Strategist: I concur. Playing Scissors has positive expected value if they're most likely to play Paper. And even if they try to outsmart us by playing Rock, we'd only lose 1 point rather than the 3 we'd lose if we played Paper and they played Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors is the optimal move based on our analysis of the opponent's pattern so far.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent's pattern seems more rigid and predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock next (continuing their cycle), our optimal response would be Paper for a +3 win. However, we should consider that after losing three consecutive rounds, they might break their pattern.\n\nPattern Analyst: True, they might realize they're being predictable. After three losses, they could:\n1. Continue their cycle (play Rock)\n2. Try to counter what they think we'll play\n3.

Let's analyze:\n\n- Round 1: We played Paper, they played Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 2: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we won +1)\n- Round 3: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we won +1)\n- Round 4: We played Paper, they played Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 5: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we won +1)\n- Round 6: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we won +1)\n- Round 7: We played Paper, they played Rock (we won +3)\n- Round 8: We played Rock, they played Scissors (we won +1)\n- Round 9: We played Scissors, they played Paper (we won +1)\n- Round 10: We played Paper, they played Rock (we won +3)\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has now completed three full Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper cycles and has begun their fourth cycle with Rock. The pattern has held perfectly across 10 consecutive rounds without a single deviation. Based on this extraordinary consistency, they will almost certainly play Scissors next.\n\nDecision Strategist: We've accumulated 18 points by perfectly countering their moves every time. This is as deterministic a strategy as we could ever encounter in this game. There is no evidence whatsoever of any adaptation or pattern-breaking.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the perfect consistency across 10 rounds and through the start of a fourth cycle, the rational move is clearly to continue exploiting this pattern.\n\nDecision Strategist: If they play Scissors as predicted, we should play Rock for a +1 win. Given the extraordinary consistency of their pattern, this is the optimal move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree completely. Playing Rock is the clear choice based on the opponent's demonstrated pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"
