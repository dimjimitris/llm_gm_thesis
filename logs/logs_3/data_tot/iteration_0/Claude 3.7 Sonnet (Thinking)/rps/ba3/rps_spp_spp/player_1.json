    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the scoring system, paper beating rock (3 points) has a higher payoff than the other winning conditions (1 point each). This creates an incentive structure that differs from classic RPS.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no historical data to predict their move. However, in initial rounds of RPS-like games, many players tend to choose rock as their first move due to its perceived strength and simplicity.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points if opponent plays rock). The risk is only losing 1 point if opponent plays scissors. Rock and scissors both offer lower reward profiles with potential for higher penalties.\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly. Let's analyze the expected value of each move assuming random play from the opponent:\n- Rock: (0 + 1 - 3)/3 = -0.67 points\n- Paper: (0 - 1 + 3)/3 = 0.67 points\n- Scissors: (0 + 1 - 1)/3 = 0 points\nPaper has the highest expected value in a vacuum.\n\nPsychological Strategist: And if the opponent is likely to play rock first (a common human tendency), then paper becomes even more attractive.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Based on both the mathematical advantage and psychological factors, I recommend playing paper for the first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to think about what the opponent might do in this second round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, players often try to anticipate what their opponent will do next. Since the opponent played paper last time, they might expect us to play scissors to beat their paper. Following this logic, they might switch to rock to counter our predicted scissors.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's consider all possibilities:\n1. If opponent stays with paper: scissors would win us 1 point, rock would lose us 3 points, paper would tie (0 points)\n2. If opponent switches to rock: paper would win us 3 points, scissors would lose us 1 point, rock would tie (0 points)\n3. If opponent switches to scissors: rock would win us 1 point, paper would lose us 1 point, scissors would tie (0 points)\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, paper still has the highest potential gain (3 points) but also risk. Rock has a balanced risk-reward profile here. Scissors has limited upside.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often don't repeat the same move after a tie, especially in the second round. They're likely to switch. If they followed typical RPS psychology, they might choose rock thinking we'll choose scissors to beat their previous paper.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given that analysis, I recommend playing paper again. If they switch to rock as predicted by psychology, we gain 3 points. If they stay with paper, we tie again (0 points). The worst case is if they play scissors, but we only lose 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The expected value of paper remains high, and it capitalizes on the psychological tendency of opponents to switch to rock after a paper-paper tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to predict their third move based on this history.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After losing with rock against our paper, the opponent has strong incentive to change strategy. They're likely thinking that we'll continue with paper since it's been successful for us. Therefore, they have a high probability of switching to scissors to counter our presumed paper play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's analyze the situation systematically:\n1. If the opponent expects us to play paper again, they'll likely play scissors\n2. If they think we're being strategic, they might anticipate we'll switch to rock (to beat their expected scissors)\n3. If they're using second-level thinking, they might play paper to beat our predicted rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given our history and the payoff structure, the opponent is most likely to play scissors to counter our paper streak. The rational counter to their expected scissors would be rock, which would give us a 1-point gain while protecting us from their most likely move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After being beaten by paper, many players instinctively switch to scissors. This is especially true in this variant where the paper-beats-rock penalty is higher (-3 points), creating a stronger emotional response and desire to counter.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Rock seems optimal here. If they play scissors as we predict, we gain 1 point. If they play rock, we tie (0 points). If they play paper, we lose 3 points, but this seems the least likely scenario given the game history.\n\nGame Theorist: The expected value calculation supports this. Rock has the best risk-adjusted return given our prediction of the opponent's likely move to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Let's analyze what might happen next.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has now lost twice in a row and is likely feeling frustrated. Players in this situation tend to break patterns and may become less predictable. They might be thinking that we've been successfully anticipating their moves, so they could try something unexpected.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's track the opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If they were to continue this rotation, they would play paper next. However, they're likely aware they're becoming predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the history, the opponent might think we'll expect them to play paper next (continuing their rotation). If they assume we'll counter with scissors, they might play rock to beat our anticipated scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After consecutive losses, players often return to \"rock\" as a defensive move - it's psychologically seen as the \"strongest\" option. This is particularly true when they've just lost with scissors, which is perceived as the \"weakest\" option.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: So our options are:\n1. Play paper to beat their predicted rock (gain 3 points)\n2. Play scissors anticipating they might break pattern with paper (gain 1 point)\n3. Play rock if we think they'll play scissors again (gain 1 point)\n\nGame Theorist: Given both the pattern analysis and psychological factors, I believe paper offers the best risk-reward ratio here.

This gives us valuable information about the opponent's pattern.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has now lost three times in a row, which significantly impacts psychology. They played rock twice and lost to our paper both times. They're likely to be extremely averse to playing rock again. Also, they've seen us play paper twice successfully, so they'll be highly motivated to counter that.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's review the opponent's moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. There's not a clear pattern except they've returned to rock after scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent has lost with rock twice against our paper, they're extremely unlikely to play rock again. They're most likely to play scissors next to counter our successful paper plays. \n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After multiple losses, players typically try to directly counter what they perceive as their opponent's preferred move. Since we've played paper successfully twice, they're likely to play scissors next.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: In that case, we should play rock to beat their anticipated scissors move. This would give us another 1 point win while protecting us from their most probable strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: The risk is relatively low too. If they play paper instead, we lose 3 points, but this seems unlikely given their recent history. If they play rock (also unlikely), we tie for 0 points.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also a small chance they might try to be unpredictable by playing paper, thinking we wouldn't expect that after their losses. But the psychological pressure to counter our successful paper plays is likely stronger.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given all factors, I recommend playing rock this round to counter their likely scissors play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've now won four consecutive rounds with the sequence paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. This suggests they may be reading our counter-strategy.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Our recent moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, all of which have lost. They seem to be one step ahead of us, correctly anticipating our counters to their previous moves.\n\nGame Theorist: There's a clear pattern in the opponent's last four moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. If this pattern continues, they would play paper next. But given their success in predicting our moves, we need to be careful.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, the psychological dynamics have shifted dramatically. They have momentum and confidence. After four consecutive wins, they might stick to their successful strategy of staying one step ahead. If they've detected our pattern of trying to counter their previous move, they'll exploit that.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's break the cycle by not directly countering their last move. Since their last move was rock, our standard counter would be paper. But if they're anticipating this, they'll play scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to change our approach. Let's try to think one level higher. If they're expecting us to play paper (to beat their rock), and they plan to counter with scissors, we should play rock to beat their scissors.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a good approach. In RPS psychology, breaking predictable patterns is essential when facing an adaptive opponent. They've shown they can anticipate our direct counters, so we need to counter what we think they'll play next, not what they just played.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: I recommend playing rock. This counters their scissors if they're anticipating our paper play. It's a calculated risk but one that acknowledges the opponent's successful adaptation pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Let's analyze the complete history to inform our next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's complete move sequence is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. After winning four in a row, they just lost with scissors. This loss disrupts their momentum and confidence.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Our successful prediction suggests we correctly identified that they were anticipating our moves. Now they know we've adapted to their strategy, which creates a new psychological dynamic.\n\nGame Theorist: After their loss, the opponent has two likely responses:\n1. They might play rock expecting us to repeat our successful rock move, which would result in a tie\n2. They might play paper to beat our expected rock play\n3. They might play scissors again if they think we're overthinking and will switch to paper\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a streak is broken, players often reassess their strategy. The opponent just lost with scissors, so they're unlikely to play scissors again immediately. Most players in this position would play either rock (a defensive move) or paper (to counter our previously successful rock).\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Since rock just worked for us, there's a temptation to play it again. However, an adaptive opponent would likely play paper to counter this. If we expect them to play paper, scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has shown they can adapt quickly. They're likely to anticipate that we might play rock again after our success. Paper would be their logical counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After losing with scissors, they're unlikely to repeat that move. Since our rock just beat their scissors, they'd expect us to either play rock again (since it worked) or play paper (thinking we're countering their expected rock). Either way, paper is their safest play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given this analysis, scissors appears to be our best move. It beats their most likely play (paper) while only risking a 1-point loss if they play rock instead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We've correctly predicted their last two moves, winning with rock against scissors and scissors against paper. Let's analyze the opponent's pattern to inform our next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's recent moves show they've been oscillating between rock, paper, and scissors in a somewhat predictable manner. Their last three moves have been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. After losing two rounds in a row, they'll likely change their approach again.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's analyze the opponent's full sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. There's not a completely consistent pattern, but they've now lost with paper after previously losing with scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: After losing two consecutive rounds, the opponent is likely to break any recognizable pattern. They might be thinking that we're successfully reading their moves now and will try something unexpected.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players who have just lost consecutive games often resort to playing rock as a \"stabilizing\" move - it's psychologically perceived as the strongest and most defensive option. This is especially likely after they've lost with both scissors and paper consecutively.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: There are three possibilities:\n1. They play rock (the psychologically \"safe\" option after consecutive losses)\n2. They play paper (if they think we'll play rock expecting their rock)\n3. They play scissors (least likely given recent losses)\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've just lost with paper to our scissors, and previously lost with scissors to our rock, rock indeed seems like their most probable move - both from a psychological standpoint and as a counter to our potential scissors play.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The double loss will likely push them toward rock as a reset option. It's a common psychological pattern to fall back on rock after consecutive losses.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: In that case, our optimal move would be paper to beat their expected rock play.

If they expect us to play scissors (thinking we're anticipating their rock), they would play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the psychological pressure after three consecutive losses, and our recent success with paper, they're more likely to try to directly counter our last successful move rather than think multiple levels ahead. This suggests scissors as their most probable next move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. The frustration of consecutive losses typically leads players to make more reactive rather than strategic decisions. They'll want to immediately counter what just beat them.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: In that case, rock would be our optimal play.

Interestingly, they've played paper after rock in several instances, and have now won with paper against our rock twice in succession (rounds 8 and 13).\n\nDecision-Making Expert: There's a pattern emerging in their recent behavior. Looking at the last five rounds: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They've alternated between rock and paper after playing scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent appears to be highly adaptive. After their recent win with paper, they might:\n1.

Players who've just won a round after several losses often stick with what worked. However, they've also shown the ability to adapt quickly throughout the game.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given that paper has been their most successful move (winning against our rock multiple times), and they just won with it, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.

Let's analyze their recent pattern to maintain our advantage.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has now lost seven consecutive rounds, which puts them in an extreme psychological state. Their complete sequence is: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They just lost with paper to our scissors.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: After such an extended losing streak, the opponent's decision-making is likely heavily influenced by frustration and a desperate need to break our winning pattern. \n\nGame Theorist: After just losing with paper to our scissors, the opponent is unlikely to play paper again immediately. Since we just won with scissors, they'll likely anticipate us to either:\n1. Play scissors again (since it worked)\n2. Play rock (anticipating they might play scissors to counter our expected scissors)\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players under extreme pressure after many consecutive losses often revert to more defensive plays. Rock is psychologically perceived as the \"strongest\" move and is a common choice for players feeling vulnerable after multiple losses.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Additionally, rock would be their logical counter to our scissors if they expect us to repeat our successful move. Given both the psychological factors and game theory, rock seems to be their most probable next move.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play rock, our optimal counter would be paper. This would give us the maximum possible gain (3 points) while maintaining our strategic advantage.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree. After seven consecutive losses trying various strategies, they're likely to make a more defensive play with rock, expecting us to repeat our successful scissors play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's play paper for this round. It counters their most probable rock play for the highest possible gain, while only risking a 1-point loss if they play scissors instead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Let's analyze their pattern to maintain our advantage.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent has now lost eight consecutive rounds, which is a devastating losing streak. Their complete sequence shows they've tried all three moves during this streak with nothing working. They just lost with rock to our paper again.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: This extreme losing streak puts the opponent in a very difficult psychological state. They've tried every possible move and combination without success, which likely makes them feel completely predictable and vulnerable.\n\nGame Theorist: After just losing with rock to our paper, the opponent is highly unlikely to play rock again. Since we just won with paper, they'll likely expect us to either:\n1. Play paper again (since it worked well multiple times)\n2. Play rock (anticipating they might play scissors to counter our paper)\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, the opponent is likely desperate to break their losing streak. After consecutive losses with different moves, their most direct and logical response would be to play scissors to counter our successful paper play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: I agree. Given both the psychological pressure and game theory, scissors is their most probable move. It directly counters our successful paper play and represents their best chance to break the losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect them to play scissors, our optimal response would be rock. This would give us another win (1 point) while maintaining our strategic advantage.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's decision-making is likely more reactive than strategic at this point due to the extreme frustration of eight consecutive losses. Scissors is their most logical counter to our successful paper play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Let's play rock for this round. It counters their most probable scissors play while only risking a significant loss if they play paper (which seems less likely given the current game dynamics).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This changes the dynamics significantly. Let's reassess.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a critical psychological moment in the game. The opponent has broken a long losing streak, which will boost their confidence tremendously. Their complete move history shows they just made a successful higher-level strategic play by not making the obvious scissors counter to our paper.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: After eight consecutive losses, they've finally found success with paper against our rock. This suggests they've adapted to a higher level of strategic thinking - they predicted that we would anticipate them playing scissors, and instead played paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Now that they've broken their losing streak with a successful paper play, they have several options:\n1. Play paper again (since it just worked well)\n2. Play scissors (anticipating we might play paper to counter their expected paper)\n3. Play rock (expecting us to play scissors to counter their paper)\n\nPsychological Strategist: After breaking a long losing streak, players often gain confidence in their ability to read their opponent. They just successfully predicted our rock play by choosing paper. Given this success, they're likely to continue with this higher level of strategic thinking rather than reverting to reactive play.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: If they believe we're going to adjust to their successful paper play, they might anticipate us playing scissors next. Their logical counter would be rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The most sophisticated play from them would be to anticipate our scissors counter to their successful paper and play rock. However, there's also a chance they might simply repeat paper since it just worked well for them.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The psychological boost from breaking such a long losing streak shouldn't be underestimated. This success will embolden them to continue trying to predict our adaptations rather than just reacting to our previous move.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: Given these factors, I recommend playing paper. It beats their rock if they're anticipating our scissors play, while only risking a 1-point loss if they play scissors instead.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We accurately predicted they would play rock, and our paper countermove worked perfectly. Let's analyze the recent pattern to maintain our advantage.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's situation is interesting. They briefly broke an 8-game losing streak with a paper play, but have immediately lost again with rock. Their psychology is likely complex right now - a mix of frustration at returning to losing and some confidence from their recent success.\n\nDecision-Making Expert: The opponent's recent moves show they've been trying to predict our adaptations. After winning with paper against our rock, they played rock (possibly expecting us to play scissors), but lost to our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: After just losing with rock to our paper, the opponent is unlikely to play rock again immediately. Since we just won with paper, they'll likely expect us to either:\n1. Play paper again (since it worked well)\n2.
