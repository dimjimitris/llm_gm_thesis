    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This creates an incentive for players to choose paper more frequently.\n\nPsychologist: First-time players often start with rock as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" Since paper would beat rock for 3 points, that might be our best opening move.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. The expected value for paper is higher given the payoff structure. If they play rock (common opening), you get 3 points. If they play scissors, you only lose 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nStatistician: Looking at the expected values: Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent due to the 3-point reward when beating rock, while only risking a 1-point loss.\n\nGame Theorist: The Nash equilibrium for this variant would actually shift toward paper being played more often than the standard 1/3 probability due to its higher payoff.\n\n[move] paper"

The first round showed they also recognized paper's value in this asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nPsychologist: Players often change their move after a tie. Many would expect us to play scissors now to counter their previous paper, so they might switch to rock to beat our anticipated scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff implications. If our opponent switches to rock (expecting us to play scissors), playing paper would give us 3 points. If they switch to scissors to beat our previous paper, we would want to play rock.\n\nStatistician: The expected value calculation is complex given we now have opponent history. There's psychological value in considering what they expect us to do.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the double-think nature of RPS games, and the asymmetric rewards favoring paper, our opponent might actually anticipate us switching to rock and thus play paper again.\n\nPsychologist: I think the most likely opponent moves are scissors (to counter our previous paper) or paper again (if they're being stubborn). Rock protects against scissors while only risking a 3-point loss if they play paper again.\n\n[move] rock"

While scissors only gives us a 1-point gain when winning, it prevents another 3-point loss like we just experienced.\n\nStatistician: If we model the opponent as having a significantly higher probability of playing paper based on past behavior and the payoff structure, scissors becomes our highest expected value play.\n\nGame Theorist: We must consider that a strategic opponent might anticipate our scissors play after they've shown a paper pattern. However, the risk-reward favors scissors here.\n\nPsychologist: Even if they anticipate our scissors and play rock, we only lose 1 point - much better than another 3-point loss if we play rock against their potential paper again.\n\n[move] scissors"

We've lost 7 points total, mostly from paper defeats.\n\nStatistician: The probability of the opponent playing paper appears significantly higher than 1/3.

Paper remains their most frequent choice, which aligns with the game's asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nStatistician: After playing paper, the opponent most commonly plays scissors (observed twice) or paper again (observed once). Based on this pattern and their adaptive style, scissors is their most probable next move.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent likely expects us to play scissors to counter their recent paper play. If they anticipate this, they'll play rock. However, they might also double-down with paper if they believe we'll overthink and play rock.\n\nPsychologist: Given their demonstrated ability to anticipate our moves, they're likely to play rock next, expecting us to counter their paper with scissors. Our safest counter to their anticipated rock would be paper.\n\n[move] paper"
