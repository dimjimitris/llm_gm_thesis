    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. I need to calculate expected value of each possible move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -0.67 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 0.67 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value due to the asymmetric payoff structure - it offers the highest reward (3 points) when winning, while risking a smaller penalty (-1) when losing.\n\n5.

Let me consider the possible strategies:\n   - If I play paper again and they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper again: I win (+1 point)\n   - If I play scissors and they anticipate this by switching to rock: I lose (-1 point)\n   - If I play rock and they play paper again: I lose (-3 points)\n\n4. Since they've shown a preference for paper in the first round, playing scissors has positive expected value if there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.\n\n5. Playing scissors is the direct counter to their previous move.

I'm on a 3-game winning streak now with a cumulative score of +3 points!\n\n4. Looking at their most recent moves, there appears to be a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle in their play.\n\n5. Based on this pattern, they would likely play rock next (continuing their paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors cycle).\n\n6. They might also try to break their losing streak by anticipating my move, thinking I'll play scissors again (since it worked).\n\n7. Given my significant lead in points, paper is the optimal choice as:\n   - It directly counters rock (which fits their pattern)\n   - Even if they break pattern and play scissors, I only lose 1 point\n   - The potential gain (+3 points) outweighs the potential loss (-1 point)\n\n[move] paper"

My cumulative score remains +6 points.\n\n4. This is significant - my opponent has broken their consistent pattern. Previously, they always played scissors after a rock-rock tie.\n\n5. The consecutive rock-rock ties suggest they've detected I've figured out their pattern and are adapting.\n\n6. After two consecutive rock plays from them, they might:\n   - Finally play scissors (reverting to their original pattern)\n   - Play rock a third time (unusual but possible)\n   - Play paper to try to counter my expected rock play\n\n7. Given that they've deliberately broken their pattern, they're likely trying to bait me into playing rock again so they can counter with paper.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at their patterns after losing with paper:\n   - After losing with paper in round 4, they played scissors in round 5\n   - After losing with paper in round 11, they played scissors in round 12\n   - After losing with paper in round 15, they played rock in round 16\n   - After losing with paper in round 18, they played rock in round 19\n\n5. Based on their most recent behavior, after losing with paper they've been playing rock.\n\n6. Given they just lost with paper, they're likely to play rock next based on their most recent pattern.\n\n7. The optimal counter to their expected rock would be paper, which would give me a significant +3 points if I'm correct.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at their patterns after losing with rock:\n   - After losing with rock in round 9, they played scissors in round 10\n   - This suggests they might play scissors after losing with rock\n\n5. Additionally, I've observed they've played scissors after losses in several instances throughout the game.\n\n6. Given they just lost substantially (-3 points) with rock, they're likely to switch to scissors based on their historical response to losses.\n\n7. The optimal counter to their expected scissors move would be rock.\n\n[move] rock"
