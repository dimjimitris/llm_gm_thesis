    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper has the highest reward (3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only award 1 point when they win. This creates different incentives than standard rock-paper-scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Against a fresh player with no established pattern, many people default to rock as their first move. It's considered psychologically \"strong\" and a common initial choice.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the payoff structure, paper has the highest expected value if all moves are equally likely from the opponent. Paper wins 3 points against rock, loses 1 point against scissors, and ties against paper, giving an expected value of +2/3 per round with random play.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since paper has the highest potential payoff and is effective against the common first-move choice (rock), it's strategically sound for the first round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Also consider that announcing your strategy might influence future rounds, but for this first move, maximizing expected value is reasonable.\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to anticipate how our opponent will respond after losing the first round.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: When a player loses to paper, they often switch to scissors in the next round to counter what just beat them. This is a common psychological pattern - trying to directly counter what just defeated you.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's analyze the expected outcomes for our next move:\n- If opponent switches to scissors (likely): Rock beats scissors (+1 points)\n- If opponent stays with rock (less likely): Paper beats rock (+3 points) \n- If opponent switches to paper (possible): Scissors beats paper (+1 points)\n\nGame Theorist: Given the asymmetric payoffs and psychological patterns, rock is our best move here. It counters the most likely opponent move (scissors) and has the least downside if we're wrong.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The opponent just lost significantly (-3 points) to paper, creating a strong psychological incentive to switch to scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock provides the optimal balance of risk and reward for this round based on likely opponent behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We just had a tie with both playing paper, which breaks the pattern we thought we were seeing.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This is significant - the opponent has broken their pattern of playing what would beat our previous move. They played paper when we expected rock. This suggests they've either changed strategies or are starting to anticipate our moves.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Let's reconsider the possibilities:\n- They could be playing a rock-scissors-paper-rock cycle regardless of our moves\n- They might have recognized our strategy and are now trying to counter it\n- They could be switching to a mimicking strategy (copying our last move)\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty, let's consider the risk-reward balance of each possible move:\n- Rock: Highest risk (-3 if they play paper), moderate reward (+1 if they play scissors)\n- Paper: Moderate risk (-1 if they play scissors), highest reward (+3 if they play rock)\n- Scissors: Moderate risk (-1 if they play rock), moderate reward (+1 if they play paper)\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since we've won with all three moves so far, the opponent might be disoriented and trying something new.

This is a common adaptation when a player is consistently losing - they start copying their opponent's last move.\n\nGame Theorist: If they are indeed mirroring us, they'll play scissors next (copying our last move). In that case, rock would be our optimal response, giving us +1 points.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The mirroring theory makes psychological sense. After losing three straight rounds, players often resort to copying their opponent's moves as a defensive strategy.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock is the least risky option right now. If they're mirroring us, we win +1. If they've reverted to their original pattern or are playing randomly, rock still has a reasonable expected value compared to other options.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's play rock this round to counter the likely scissors move from our opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They've tried countering and mirroring without success. They might revert to rock, which many players consider the \"safe\" move when confused.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree that rock from them is likely.

Looking at their pattern, when they lose, they often counter the move that beat them in the next round.\n\nGame Theorist: If they follow this pattern of countering what beat them, they'll likely play rock to counter our scissors from the previous round.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Rock has been their least played move (only 1 out of 10 rounds), making it due for selection according to probability balancing that many players unconsciously follow.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. After losing with paper to our scissors, they're likely to play rock which would beat scissors. This follows both their psychological pattern and general game theory.\n\nGame Theorist: If we expect rock from them, our optimal move is paper, which would give us +3 points - the highest possible single-round score.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

After losing with rock against our paper, based on their established pattern, they will almost certainly play scissors next to counter our paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Their strategy of playing what would beat our previous move has been maintained without exception in the later rounds. If they play scissors as expected, rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nStatistical Analyst: They've now played rock 5 times, scissors 8 times, and paper 7 times. Their distribution continues to align perfectly with their counter-strategy pattern.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: At this point, the pattern is so ingrained that even if they consciously wanted to break it, the psychological tendency to follow established patterns would likely prevail.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock is clearly our best move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
