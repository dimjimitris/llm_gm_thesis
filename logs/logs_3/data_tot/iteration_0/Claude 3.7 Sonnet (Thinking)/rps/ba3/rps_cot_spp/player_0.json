    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

For this second round, I need to predict how my opponent might adjust their strategy.\n\n3.

Since I played paper last round, my opponent might expect me to play paper again OR might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper.\n\n5. If they switch to scissors to counter my previous paper, playing rock would be optimal as rock beats scissors.\n\n6. Reviewing the payoff structure:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I gain 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If I play rock and they play rock: 0 points (tie)\n\n7.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 6: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3 points)\n   - Round 9: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1 points)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: Both paper (tie)\n\n2. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Paper\n\n3. They've completed a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle in the last three rounds. If they follow this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n4. We've had numerous ties recently (rounds 9, 11, and 12), suggesting we may be thinking similarly or they're predicting my moves well.\n\n5. After playing paper, they might:\n   - Play rock (continuing their observed cycle)\n   - Play scissors (expecting me to play paper again, as I've played paper often)\n   - Play paper again (hoping for another tie or thinking I'll switch to rock)\n\n6. Given I've played paper frequently throughout the game, they might anticipate me playing paper again and counter with scissors.\n\n7. To counter their expected scissors play, rock would be my best move:\n   - If they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock: tie, 0 points\n   - If they play paper: I lose 3 points\n\n[move] rock"

If they continue this pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n4. We've had five ties in the game, with four of the last five rounds resulting in ties. This suggests we're thinking similarly.\n\n5. After playing rock, they might:\n   - Play scissors (continuing their observed cycle)\n   - Play paper (expecting me to play rock again)\n   - Play rock again (extending our series of ties)\n\n6. Given their apparent cyclical pattern, scissors seems most likely as their next move.\n\n7. To counter scissors, I should play rock again:\n   - If they play scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If they play paper: I lose 3 points\n   - If they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n[move] rock"
