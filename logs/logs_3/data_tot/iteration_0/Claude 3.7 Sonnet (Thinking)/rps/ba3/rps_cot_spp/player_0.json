    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 points for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point for winner, -1 point for loser\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I need to consider expected values.\n\n3. Calculating expected value against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -0.67 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 0.67 points\n   - Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value due to the high payoff (+3) when beating rock.\n\n5. Additionally, many players tend to lead with rock in the first round of rock-paper-scissors games, making paper an even stronger opening choice.\n\n[move] paper"

This pattern is very consistent - after losing with rock against my paper, they play scissors.\n\n5. I've now won 5 consecutive rounds against them (excluding the tie), so they may be desperate to break my winning streak.\n\n6. Given their historical pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] rock"

My recent predictable paper plays (3 times in a row) likely contributed to their win.\n\n5. After playing scissors, the opponent has historically played rock or paper:\n   - Earlier in the game (rounds 2, 7): scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Later in the game (rounds 9, 12): scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. They may feel confident after winning and:\n   - Continue with scissors expecting me to play paper again\n   - Play paper anticipating I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors\n   - Revert to rock, their most common move overall\n\n7.

Looking at what the opponent does after losing with paper to scissors:\n   - After losing in round 18, they played rock in round 19\n\n4. With only one data point for this specific scenario, it's hard to establish a clear pattern, but they did play rock after losing with paper previously.\n\n5. The opponent's most common move historically has been rock (8 out of 21 rounds, about 38%).\n\n6. When frustrated or trying to change a losing streak, players often revert to their comfort move.\n\n7. Given their historical preference for rock and the psychological impact of four consecutive losses, paper would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] paper"

I've now won five consecutive rounds after their previous winning streak.\n\n3. Looking at what the opponent does after losing with rock to my paper:\n   - After losing in round 1, they played scissors in round 2\n   - After losing in round 6, they played scissors in round 7\n   - After losing in round 8, they played scissors in round 9\n   - After losing in round 11, they played scissors in round 12\n   - After losing in round 19, they played scissors in round 20\n\n4. This pattern is extremely consistent - after losing with rock against paper, they've played scissors 100% of the time (5/5).\n\n5. Given their perfect historical pattern and likely frustration after five consecutive losses, they're highly likely to play scissors.\n\n6. To counter their anticipated scissors play, rock would be my optimal move.\n\n[move] rock"

This breaks their previously consistent pattern of playing scissors after losing with rock.\n\n4. Looking at what they do after winning with paper:\n   - After winning in round 15, they played rock in round 16 (only previous instance)\n\n5. The opponent is clearly adapting their strategy to be less predictable.\n\n6. Given they just won with paper, they might:\n   - Play paper again, thinking I'll avoid rock after just losing to paper\n   - Play scissors anticipating I might play paper to counter their expected rock\n   - Play rock, following their limited historical pattern after winning with paper\n\n7. Since they just had success with paper (+3 points), they might be tempted to repeat this successful move or anticipate my adaptation.\n\n[move] scissors"
