In traditional rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to throw rock as their first move.\n\n5. Even if they don't play rock, the downside of playing paper is limited (-1 if they play scissors).\n\n6.

It protects against their potential rock play, which is a common move after a scissors tie, and offers the highest potential gain (+3).",

They've played rock in both of the last two rounds, suggesting they might continue with rock again.\n\nLet's analyze my options:\n1. If I play rock:\n   - They play rock: tie (0 points)\n   - They play paper: lose (-3 points)\n   - They play scissors: win (+1 point)\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - They play rock: win (+3 points)\n   - They play paper: tie (0 points)\n   - They play scissors: lose (-1 point)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - They play rock: lose (-1 point)\n   - They play paper: win (+1 point)\n   - They play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nSince they've played rock in the last two rounds, and rock is their most frequent choice overall, I should counter with paper. This gives me the best potential reward (+3) if they stick with rock. Even if they switch to scissors, I only lose 1 point, which is a manageable risk.\n\nI need to break out of the tie pattern, and playing paper gives me the highest expected value given their tendency toward rock.",

Since this is the first round and my opponent is a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their tendencies.\n\n3) Given the asymmetric payoffs, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) while rock has the highest potential penalty (-3 points). Scissors and rock both have lower rewards/penalties (1 point).\n\n4) Strategic considerations:\n   - If I play rock: I win 1 point if opponent plays scissors, lose 3 if opponent plays paper, tie if opponent plays rock\n   - If I play paper: I win 3 points if opponent plays rock, lose 1 if opponent plays scissors, tie if opponent plays paper\n   - If I play scissors: I win 1 point if opponent plays paper, lose 1 if opponent plays rock, tie if opponent plays scissors\n\n5) Without prior information, I should consider the expected value of each move assuming the opponent randomly chooses:\n   - Expected value of rock = (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) = -2/3\n   - Expected value of paper = (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = 2/3\n   - Expected value of scissors = (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nBased on expected value calculation, paper has the highest expected value.

The payoff structure is asymmetric. Paper beating rock has a higher reward/penalty (3 points) compared to the other winning conditions (1 point).\n\n2. Given this asymmetry, players might be incentivized to play rock less often (to avoid the -3 penalty if the opponent plays paper) and play paper more often (to potentially get the +3 reward if the opponent plays rock).\n\n3. If players play paper more often, scissors becomes attractive as a counter-strategy.\n\n4. However, rock beats scissors, which might make scissors less attractive.\n\nIt's a complex game theory problem with this asymmetric payoff structure.\n\nFor the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy. In standard rock, paper, scissors, all moves are equally valid for the first play. But given the asymmetric payoffs here, there might be an optimal starting strategy.\n\nSince paper has the highest potential reward (+3), it might be tempting to start with that. However, if the opponent anticipates this and plays scissors, I'd be at a disadvantage (-1).\n\nSimilarly, if I start with rock, the opponent playing paper would give me a significant penalty (-3). Scissors starting against rock would also be negative (-1).\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the asymmetric payoffs, I'll choose scissors for my first move. The potential loss with scissors (-1 if opponent plays rock) is less severe than the potential loss with rock (-3 if opponent plays paper).\n\nSo, my first move will be scissors.",
