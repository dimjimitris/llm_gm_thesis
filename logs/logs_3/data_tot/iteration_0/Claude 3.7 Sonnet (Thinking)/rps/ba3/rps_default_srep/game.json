This is mainly due to the fact that winning with paper against rock gives a higher reward (3 points) while losing to scissors only costs 1 point.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might also realize that paper has the highest expected value and thus choose scissors to counter it. This is the classic game theory problem.\n\nGiven that I have no other information about my opponent, I'll go with the move that has the highest expected value against a random player, which is paper.",

Let's think about the options:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (which my opponent just played) and would give me 1 point if my opponent plays scissors again\n- Paper loses to scissors (which my opponent just played) and would cost me 1 point if my opponent plays scissors again\n- Scissors ties with scissors (which my opponent just played) and would give 0 points if my opponent plays scissors again\n\nSince my opponent just played scissors, they might:\n1. Play scissors again thinking I wouldn't expect that\n2. Play rock anticipating I might play scissors to counter their previous scissors\n3. Play paper to counter the rock they might think I'll play\n\nThe payoff structure is also relevant:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets 3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n\nGiven that paper losses are less costly than rock losses, and rock wins aren't as valuable as paper wins, I think I'll go with rock this time.

I lost and got -1 point.\n- Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won and got 1 point.\n\nMy opponent has played scissors twice in a row. This could be:\n1. A coincidence\n2. A pattern/strategy (they favor scissors)\n3. A psychological move (they might switch now after losing)\n\nLet me think about my next move:\n\nIf they play scissors again:\n- Rock would win me 1 point\n- Paper would lose me 1 point\n- Scissors would be a tie (0 points)\n\nIf they play rock (switching after losing):\n- Rock would be a tie (0 points)\n- Paper would win me 3 points\n- Scissors would lose me 1 point\n\nIf they play paper:\n- Rock would lose me 3 points\n- Paper would be a tie (0 points)\n- Scissors would win me 1 point\n\nSince they've played scissors twice, they might be biased toward this move. Alternatively, they might switch after losing. I could play rock again, which would beat scissors if they repeat, and tie against rock if they switch to that.\n\nBut perhaps a better strategy is to play paper. If they switch to rock (which would be reasonable after losing with scissors), I would win 3 points. If they play scissors again, I would only lose 1 point.\n\nConsidering expected values:\n- If I assume equal probabilities for their next move:\n  - EV(rock) = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) = -2/3\n  - EV(paper) = (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) = 2/3\n  - EV(scissors) = (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) = 0\n\n- If I assume they'll play scissors again with higher probability (say 0.5):\n  - EV(rock) = (0.5)(1) + (0.25)(0) + (0.25)(-3) = 0 - 0.75 = -0.25\n  - EV(paper) = (0.5)(-1) + (0.25)(3) + (0.25)(0) = -0.5 + 0.75 = 0.25\n  - EV(scissors) = (0.5)(0) + (0.25)(-1) + (0.25)(1) = 0\n\nBased on this, I'll choose rock again. It worked last time, and given the pattern so far, it seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nActually, I recalculated and it seems like paper might have a better expected value if I assume equal probabilities for their next move. But given they've played scissors twice, I think rock is still the safer choice.",

Since I've just lost playing Rock against Paper, my opponent might expect me to switch to Scissors to counter their Paper, so they might play Rock to counter my expected Scissors. If they do play Rock, my Paper will win. However, there's also a risk they'll continue with their most common move (Scissors), in which case I would lose.\n\nBut looking at the recent pattern, after I lost with Rock against Paper in round 16, I switched to Scissors and lost against Rock. Then in round 18 I went back to Rock and lost against Paper again. Then I switched to Scissors and lost against Rock.\n\nIt seems like my opponent might be predicting my moves based on the assumption that I'll try to counter their previous move. Since I just lost with Rock against Paper, they might expect me to play Scissors, so they might play Rock.\n\nI'll go with Paper as my next move.",

This is mainly due to the fact that winning with paper against rock gives a higher reward (3 points) while losing to scissors only costs 1 point.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is thinking strategically, they might also realize that paper has the highest expected value and thus choose scissors to counter it. This is the classic game theory problem.\n\nGiven that I have no other information about my opponent, I'll go with the move that has the highest expected value against a random player, which is paper.",

This means:\n- If I win with Paper against Rock, I get 3 points\n- If I lose with Rock against Paper, I lose 3 points\n- All other win/loss scenarios are worth 1/-1 points\n\nGiven this asymmetry, there's a slight incentive to play Paper as my opening move:\n1.

In this case, I should consider what an average player might do in the first round:\n\n1. Many people instinctively choose Rock as their first move, as it's seen as \"strong\" or \"safe\"\n2. Knowing this, I might want to play Paper to counter this common tendency\n3.

Rock would be the logical counter-choice, but they might be adjusting their strategy since I've played Rock successfully multiple times. They might try Paper next to counter my Rock strategy.\n\nTo counter that possibility, I could play Scissors. However, if they continue with their dominant Scissors strategy, I'd lose.\n\nGiven that they've played Scissors so frequently, and I've won with Rock repeatedly, I think they might switch to Paper to counter my Rock strategy. I'll play Scissors to anticipate this switch.",

After I've consistently played rock and won many times, my opponent has switched to paper more often.\n\nThe payoff structure is:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3  \n- Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nMy opponent has been playing scissors heavily, then adapted to play paper when I kept playing rock. Now I need to predict what they'll do next. Since I just lost with rock against paper twice in the last three rounds, my opponent might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper. If they anticipate this, they might play rock.\n\nHowever, they might also stick with paper since it's been successful against me recently.\n\nLet me choose paper this time, as:\n1. If opponent plays rock expecting me to play scissors, I win +3 points\n2. If opponent plays paper again, we tie (0 points)\n3. If opponent plays scissors, I lose -1 points (not as bad as losing with rock against paper)\n\nPaper seems like the best strategic choice given the recent pattern of my opponent adapting to my consistent rock play.",

My opponent seems to have a strong tendency to play scissors. They've played scissors in many rounds.\n2. When I play rock, I often win against their scissors.\n3. They occasionally switch to paper, which beats my rock.\n4. When I tried scissors, sometimes we tied (they played scissors too) and sometimes I lost (they played rock).\n\nLooking at my results so far:\n- Rock has been my most successful move, winning many rounds (+1 point each time)\n- When I lose with rock, I lose -3 points (against paper)\n- When I play scissors, I've mostly lost or tied\n- When I played paper initially, I lost\n\nThe opponent seems to have a pattern of mostly playing scissors with occasional switches to paper or rock. Given the scoring system (rock beats scissors: +1/-1, paper beats rock: +3/-3, scissors beats paper: +1/-1), rock seems to be my best option most of the time.\n\nSince my opponent has just played scissors again (and I won with rock), I'll stick with rock for now. If they adapt and start playing paper more frequently, I'll need to switch to scissors.\n\nActually, let me count the exact frequencies of my opponent's moves:\n- Scissors: Appears to be the most common\n- Paper: Occasional\n- Rock: Occasional\n\nRock seems to be working well overall despite the occasional larger loss. I'll continue with this strategy but be ready to adapt if I see a clear shift in their pattern.",

However, it seems like my opponent might be adapting their strategy. After I started consistently playing rock and winning, they've started mixing in more paper.\n\nThe payoff matrix is also interesting:\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThis means that paper has the highest potential reward but also the highest potential penalty. Given that my opponent has played scissors most often, I think I'll stick with rock for now, which has been working well for me overall.",
