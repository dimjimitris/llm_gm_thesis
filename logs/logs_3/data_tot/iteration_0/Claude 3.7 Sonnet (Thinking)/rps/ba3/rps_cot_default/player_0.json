Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to analyze.\n\n3. Paper has the highest potential reward (+3 when beating rock) but also risk (-1 when losing to scissors).\n\n4. Studies suggest that rock is a common opening move in rock-paper-scissors for new players.\n\n5. Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper provides the highest potential gain if my opponent plays rock.\n\n6.

Analyzing the previous round:\n   - Both my opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This gives me information that my opponent might think similarly to me\n\n2.

After a tie in rock-paper-scissors, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeating\n\n4. If my opponent repeats paper, my best move would be scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. If they switch to scissors anticipating my paper again, scissors would result in a tie (0 points)\n\n6. If they switch to rock anticipating my scissors, I would lose only 1 point instead of 3 (if I played paper and they played scissors)\n\n7.
