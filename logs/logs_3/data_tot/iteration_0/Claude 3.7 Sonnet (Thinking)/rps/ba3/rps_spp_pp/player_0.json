    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3) when beaten. Rock and scissors both have lower stakes (+1/-1). In a one-shot game without prior information about the opponent, we need to consider the expected value of each move.\n\nStatistical Analyst: In the first round with a fresh player, we have no historical data to analyze. Traditional game theory suggests a mixed strategy might be optimal. However, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors, making paper potentially advantageous.\n\nPsychological Profiler: First-time players often choose rock as it symbolizes strength. Though this is a modified game, that psychological tendency might persist. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose paper instead.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the higher reward for paper winning (+3), and the common tendency for players to choose rock first, I'll choose paper for the first move despite its risk.\n\n[move] paper"

However, players often don't repeat the same move in consecutive rounds of rock-paper-scissors.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After winning with scissors, the opponent might either feel confident and stick with it or assume you'll counter with rock and switch to paper themselves.\n\nRisk Assessment Specialist: The payoff structure makes paper the riskiest move (+3/-1) while rock and scissors have more balanced risk-reward (+1/-1 or -3/+3). \n\nDecision Maker: Given that opponents often don't repeat moves and the psychological tendency to counter-predict, I'll choose rock. If they repeat scissors, we win. If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we lose but gather more information for future rounds.\n\n[move] rock"

Scissors would be optimal against paper, giving us a +1 reward with moderate risk.\n\nDecision Maker: Based on these analyses, I'll play scissors. This counters the paper move that the opponent might be planning next in a rotation strategy, and it offers a balanced risk-reward profile.\n\n[move] scissors"
