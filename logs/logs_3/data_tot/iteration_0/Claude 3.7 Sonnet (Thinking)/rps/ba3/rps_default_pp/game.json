Similarly, losing to paper costs 3 points while losing to rock or scissors only costs 1 point.\n\nSince I'm facing a fresh player with no history, I don't have any information about their tendencies. Let me think about a good opening move:\n\n1. Rock: Safe option that defends against scissors (-1 if I lose) but vulnerable to paper (-3 if I lose)\n2. Paper: Highest reward potential (+3 if I win) but vulnerable to scissors (-1 if I lose)\n3. Scissors: Modest reward potential (+1 if I win) but vulnerable to rock (-1 if I lose)\n\nGiven the payoff structure, paper seems like a good opening move because:\n- It has the highest potential reward (+3)\n- If I lose, I only lose 1 point\n- Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in RPS as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\"\n\nI'll choose paper as my opening move.",

For example:\n- I play rock in round 4, then they play rock in round 5\n- I play paper in round 5, then they play paper in round 6\n- I play scissors in round 6, then they play scissors in round 7\n\nThis pattern has been consistent since round 3. I've been cycling through rock, paper, scissors in that order, and it's been working perfectly.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should continue with the same strategy. Since I just played paper in the previous round (round 20), I should play scissors now to maintain my winning streak.",

This has led to consistent wins after my first loss and tie.\n\nMy overall score so far:\n- First round: Paper vs Scissors = -1 point\n- Second round: Rock vs Rock = 0 points\n- All subsequent rounds: Winning with the pattern = +1 or +3 points\n\nSince this strategy has been working consistently for many rounds, I should continue with it for maximum points.

Paper beating rock has a higher payoff (3 points) than the other winning combinations (1 point each). This suggests that if I can successfully play paper against rock, I get the highest possible reward.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game with equal payoffs, the optimal strategy would be to play each move with equal probability (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).\n\nHowever, given the asymmetric payoffs in this game, I might want to adjust my strategy. Let's think about this:\n\n1. If my opponent plays randomly (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), then:\n   - If I play rock: Expected value = (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) = -2/3\n   - If I play paper: Expected value = (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = 2/3\n   - If I play scissors: Expected value = (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nBased on expected value against a random player, paper would be the best move.\n\n2. If my opponent is strategic, they might anticipate I'll choose paper for the higher reward potential. In that case, they might be more likely to choose scissors to counter paper. If I anticipate this, I should choose rock.\n\n3. However, if my opponent anticipates this chain of reasoning, they might choose paper to counter my rock. And the cycle continues...\n\nGiven that it's the first move and I don't have information about my opponent, I'll go with the move that has the highest expected value against a random player, which is paper.",

The standard Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic example of a zero-sum game with a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs in this version:\n- If I expect my opponent to play randomly with equal probability for each move, then:\n  * Expected value of Rock: 1/3 \u00d7 0 (tie) + 1/3 \u00d7 (-3) (lose to Paper) + 1/3 \u00d7 1 (beat Scissors) = -2/3\n  * Expected value of Paper: 1/3 \u00d7 3 (beat Rock) + 1/3 \u00d7 0 (tie) + 1/3 \u00d7 (-1) (lose to Scissors) = 2/3\n  * Expected value of Scissors: 1/3 \u00d7 (-1) (lose to Rock) + 1/3 \u00d7 1 (beat Paper) + 1/3 \u00d7 0 (tie) = 0\n\nBased on this naive analysis, Paper would be the best first move if I expect a completely random opponent.\n\nHowever, in reality, human players often don't play randomly. There are some common patterns:\n1. Rock is often a popular first move for many novice players\n2. Some players might try to be clever and start with Paper, expecting Rock\n3. Very strategic players might even go for Scissors, expecting others to play Paper\n\nSince this is the first move against a \"fresh player\" (which I interpret as a new opponent who hasn't played before), I don't have any data on their playing style.
