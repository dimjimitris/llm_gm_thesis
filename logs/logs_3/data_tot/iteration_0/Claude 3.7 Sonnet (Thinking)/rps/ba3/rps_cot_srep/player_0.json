    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no historical data to base my decision on.\n\n3. The payoffs are asymmetric - Paper beating Rock offers the highest reward (3 points) compared to other winning combinations (1 point).\n\n4. Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\n5. If I anticipate this tendency, choosing Paper would be optimal as it would give me the maximum possible points (+3) against a Rock opener.\n\n6. Even if my opponent doesn't play Rock, playing Paper minimizes my potential loss compared to playing Rock (which could lose 3 points).\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"

They've now played Scissors three consecutive times, which is unprecedented in our game history.\n\n4. I've won with Rock against their Scissors twice in a row now (rounds 9 and 11).\n\n5. After repeated losses with the same move, opponents typically change strategy. They might expect me to play Rock again and counter with Paper.\n\n6. Overall frequency of their moves:\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   - Rock: 2 times\n   - Paper: 2 times\n\n7. If they finally adapt and play Paper, my playing Scissors would win (+1 point).\n   If they stubbornly continue with Scissors, my playing Scissors would tie (0 points).\n\n8. Given the strong possibility they'll finally switch to Paper after losing with Scissors multiple times, Scissors seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"

They've now played Rock twice in the last three rounds, which may indicate a shift in their strategy.\n\n4. Overall, they've played:\n   - Scissors: 13 times (65%)\n   - Rock: 5 times (25%)\n   - Paper: 2 times (10%)\n\n5. After our previous two ties with Rock, they might anticipate me playing Rock again and counter with Paper.\n\n6. They might also be recognizing that their Scissors strategy hasn't been effective and are adapting by using Rock more frequently.\n\n7. If they continue with Rock, Paper would be my best counter (+3 points).\n   If they revert to Scissors, Paper would lose (-1 point).\n\n8. Given their recent tendency toward Rock and the high payoff if they play Rock again, Paper seems like a strategic choice despite the risk.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper"
