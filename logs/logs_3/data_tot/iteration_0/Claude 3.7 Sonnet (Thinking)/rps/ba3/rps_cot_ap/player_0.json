    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points for winner, -3 for loser\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Looking at the point values, I notice paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points) compared to the other winning scenarios (1 point each).\n\n4. If I assume my opponent might choose moves with equal probability, paper would have the highest expected value:\n   - Paper wins big against rock (+3)\n   - Paper loses small against scissors (-1)\n   - This makes paper a favorable first move when facing uncertainty\n\n5. While scissors is safe (can only lose 1 point at worst), it doesn't have the upside potential that paper does.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for its higher potential reward.\n\n[move] paper"

In rock-paper-scissors style games, players often switch moves after a tie, with scissors being a common choice to counter paper.\n\n7. Given that scissors has the potential to win against paper (if they repeat) and the point loss is lower (-1) if they play rock compared to the paper-scissors loss (-1), scissors seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors since it counters their previous move and limits potential losses.\n\n[move] scissors"
