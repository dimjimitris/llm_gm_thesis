If I assume my opponent might choose moves with equal probability, paper would have the highest expected value:\n   - Paper wins big against rock (+3)\n   - Paper loses small against scissors (-1)\n   - This makes paper a favorable first move when facing uncertainty\n\n5.

Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3.

If I assume my opponent might choose moves with equal probability, paper would have the highest expected value:\n   - Paper wins big against rock (+3)\n   - Paper loses small against scissors (-1)\n   - This makes paper a favorable first move when facing uncertainty\n\n5.

      "reasoning_text": "I need to decide on a move: rock, paper, or scissors. Let's analyze the game and think about a strategy.\n\nFirst, let's understand the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Tie: No points awarded\n\nI notice that paper beating rock has the highest reward (3 points) and also the highest penalty (-3 points). This makes paper-rock interactions high-stakes compared to the others which only involve 1 point transfers.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make a reasonable first move. Let's consider the expected value of each move:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If opponent chooses rock: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent chooses paper: -3 points (I lose)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If opponent chooses rock: 3 points (I win)\n- If opponent chooses paper: 0 points (tie)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If opponent chooses rock: -1 point (I lose)\n- If opponent chooses paper: 1 point (I win)\n- If opponent chooses scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIf I assume the opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability for each move), the expected value would be:\n- Rock: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.67\n- Paper: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.67\n- Scissors: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this calculation, paper has the highest expected value against a random player due to the high reward when it beats rock.\n\nHowever, there's another consideration. If the opponent thinks strategically, they might choose paper as their first move for the same reason I calculated. If that's the case, scissors would be the best counter.\n\nGiven that this is a one-shot game with no history, I'll go with paper as my first move since it has the highest expected value against a random player.",

What's most likely? In rock-paper-scissors games, players often switch after ties since they assume the opponent will change. If my opponent follows this pattern, they're more likely to switch from paper.\n\n4. If they switch, they could go to either rock or scissors. Given that scissors beats paper but only gives +1, while paper beats rock and gives +3, they might calculate that rock is safer (since losing to paper is -3 but losing to scissors is only -1).\n\n5. If I assume they might switch to rock, then my best response would be paper. However, this would lead to another tie if they stick with paper.\n\n6. Scissors would win against paper and tie against scissors, only losing to rock.\n\n7. Based on game theory principles and the asymmetric rewards, scissors seems like a good move here. It wins against paper (which they might stick with) and only loses to rock (which they might switch to).",

They continue with paper (consistent with their pattern of persistence)\n2. They finally switch to rock after two scissors losses (to counter my scissors)\n3. They switch to scissors (least likely based on their pattern)\n\nGiven their strong historical tendency to stick with moves across 3+ rounds and their demonstrated willingness to continue with a move even after losing, paper seems most likely again. However, after two consecutive losses, the probability they'll switch increases.\n\nIf they play paper: scissors wins (+1)\nIf they play rock: scissors loses (-1)\nIf they play scissors: tie (0)\n\nThis is a tough call. Their pattern suggests they might still play paper, but after two consecutive losses, they might finally switch to rock. The expected value calculation doesn't clearly favor one move over another without knowing the probabilities.\n\nGiven their demonstrated persistence with moves historically, I think there's still a higher chance they'll stick with paper than switch. I'll play scissors again, but this is definitely a pivotal point where they might change strategy.",

In standard rock-paper-scissors, rock is often a common first move for many players, as research has shown. However, in this variant with asymmetric payoffs, the opponent might be inclined to choose paper since it offers the highest reward.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, paper seems to have the highest potential reward (3 points), but also the highest potential loss (-3 points) if countered correctly. Rock has a decent upside (1 point) with a significant downside (-3 points). Scissors has modest outcomes in both directions (1 point or -1 point).\n\nI think for the first move, I'll go with scissors. Here's my reasoning:\n1. If my opponent plays rock (a common first move), I'll lose but only by a small margin (-1 point).\n2. If my opponent plays paper (trying to capitalize on the high reward), I'll win 1 point.\n3. If my opponent plays scissors, we tie (0 points).\n\nThis seems like a balanced first move given the asymmetric payoffs and no prior information about my opponent.",

Earlier in the game (rounds 1-9): They would play the same move for extended periods (4-5 rounds)\n2. More recently (rounds 10-13): They've become more varied, switching between rock and scissors\n\nLooking at their most recent moves:\n- Round 11: rock\n- Round 12: scissors\n- Round 13: scissors\n\nThey played scissors twice in a row now. This could indicate:\n- They might be reverting to their earlier pattern of playing the same move multiple times\n- They might continue with scissors for a few more rounds\n- Or they might be becoming more strategic and anticipate that I'll play rock again\n\nIf they expect me to play rock again (since I just won with it), they might play paper.\nIf they are sticking with scissors for multiple rounds (as per their earlier pattern), they'll play scissors again.\nIf they're trying to be unpredictable, they could play any move.\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n- If I play rock: I win if they play scissors (+1), lose if they play paper (-3), tie if they play rock\n- If I play paper: I win if they play rock (+3), lose if they play scissors (-1), tie if they play paper\n- If I play scissors: I win if they play paper (+1), lose if they play rock (-1), tie if they play scissors\n\nGiven that they just lost with scissors against my rock, a rational player would likely switch to paper. However, my opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves (especially scissors) even after losses.\n\nTheir most recent behavior (2 scissors plays in a row) suggests they might be reverting to their early-game pattern of sticking with moves for extended periods. If so, scissors might be their play again.\n\nSince my rock just beat their scissors, playing rock again has decent odds of winning if they're stubborn with scissors. However, it's vulnerable to a paper counter.\n\nGiven that the opponent has shown a pattern of stubbornness with scissors historically, and has now played scissors twice in a row (potentially starting another scissors streak), I think rock is still a reasonable play. The risk is them countering with paper, but their history suggests scissors persistence is more likely.",
