    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The payoffs are asymmetric:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points) and highest penalty (-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give smaller rewards/penalties (1 and -1)\n3. This is the first round against a new player, so I have no history to base my decision on.\n4. Let me calculate the expected value of each move assuming random play:\n   - Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points\n   - Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n5. Paper has the highest expected value.\n6. Additionally, many players tend to choose rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games.\n7. Given both the mathematical advantage and psychological factors, paper seems optimal.\n\n[move] paper"

I should consider possible patterns in my opponent's play:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it worked last time\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to rock and thus play paper\n   - They might try to be unpredictable\n\n4. Let me review my options:\n   - If I play rock and they repeat scissors: I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and they repeat scissors: I lose 1 point again\n   - If I play scissors and they repeat scissors: It's a tie, 0 points\n\n5. Since this is only the second round, I can't be certain of a pattern yet, but countering their previous move makes strategic sense.\n6. Playing rock counters their previous scissors move, and if they switch to paper (anticipating my rock), I would only lose 3 points, but if they switch to rock, it would be a tie.\n7. The risk-reward ratio favors playing rock at this point.\n\n[move] rock"

If my opponent plays scissors again, it would be a tie with scissors.\n\n6. Psychologically, players often avoid playing the same move three times in a row, making it less likely they'll play rock again.\n\n7. Weighing these possibilities, scissors gives me the best chance to win if they follow a rotation pattern, and limits my loss if I'm wrong.\n\n[move] scissors"

Playing rock is my best move as it counters their expected scissors play.\n\n7.
