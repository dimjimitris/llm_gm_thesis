If I play Rock:\n   - Against Rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - Against Paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - Against Scissors: +1 point (I win)\n   - Expected value if opponent plays randomly: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\n2. If I play Paper:\n   - Against Rock: +3 points (I win)\n   - Against Paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - Against Scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n   - Expected value if opponent plays randomly: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3\n\n3. If I play Scissors:\n   - Against Rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - Against Paper: +1 point (I win)\n   - Against Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n   - Expected value if opponent plays randomly: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on pure expected value against a random player, Paper has the highest expected value at 2/3 points. This is because the win with Paper against Rock gives the highest point reward (+3) in the game.\n\nHowever, experienced Rock-Paper-Scissors players often don't play randomly. Many novice players tend to choose Rock as their first move (this is a common observation), so Paper might be an even better strategic choice.\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player and considering both the expected value calculation and common player psychology, I'll choose Paper as my move.",

I've won the last 4 rounds, so they might try to counter my next move.\n\nSince paper has the highest potential reward (3 points), and I've been winning with it against rock, I'll play paper again.",

If they've just played Scissors twice, they might switch to another move now, possibly Rock or Paper. \n\nGiven the overall pattern and the fact that they often switch after 2-3 of the same move, I think they're likely to switch from Scissors to either Rock or Paper. If they switch to Rock, my best move would be Paper (3 points). If they switch to Paper, my best move would be Scissors (1 point).\n\nThe payoff for guessing correctly with Paper (3 points) is higher than with Scissors (1 point), so I'll go with Paper.",

This is because the win with Paper against Rock gives the highest point reward (+3) in the game.\n\nHowever, experienced Rock-Paper-Scissors players often don't play randomly. Many novice players tend to choose Rock as their first move (this is a common observation), so Paper might be an even better strategic choice.\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player and considering both the expected value calculation and common player psychology, I'll choose Paper as my move.",

In standard Rock, Paper, Scissors games, there's no dominant strategy if both players are rational. Each move should theoretically be played with 1/3 probability for optimal mixed strategy.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to note in this particular payoff structure:\n1. Paper beating Rock gives a higher reward (+3) than other winning moves (+1)\n2. Rock losing to Paper gives a higher penalty (-3) than other losing moves (-1)\n\nThis means:\n- Paper has the highest potential upside (3 points)\n- Rock has the highest potential downside (-3 points)\n- Scissors has a balanced risk-reward profile\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who presumably hasn't established a pattern yet, I'll need to make a move based on general strategy. Given the asymmetric payoffs, playing Paper is attractive due to its higher reward potential. However, if they anticipate this and play Scissors, I would lose (though only by 1 point).\n\nSince this is the first move and there's no history to analyze, I'll choose Paper as my opening move.

This asymmetric payoff structure means there's an incentive to play paper more often, especially if I think my opponent will play rock.\n\nLet's think about a general strategy:\n1. Since paper has the highest potential reward, there's an incentive for both players to play it more often\n2. But if players favor paper, then scissors becomes a good counter\n3. And if scissors becomes popular, rock becomes valuable\n4. Which brings us back to paper beating rock...\n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors cycle, but with asymmetric rewards.\n\nFor the first move with no prior information about my opponent's strategy, I need to make a choice. Given the higher payoff for paper, I might expect a rational opponent to play rock slightly less often. So paper might be slightly less valuable than in standard RPS.\n\nGiven this is the first move and I have no data on my opponent, I'll go with scissors as my opening move.

This creates an interesting strategic element.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new or someone who hasn't played before), I don't have any information about their past behavior to inform my strategy.

Paper has the highest potential payoff (+3)\n3. Scissors has a standard payoff (+1) when it wins\n\nAgainst a fresh player with no established pattern, I should consider the asymmetric payoffs. Since paper has the highest potential reward, many players might be tempted to choose it.

They played:\n- Scissors twice\n- Paper five times\n- Rock three times\n- Scissors four times\n- Paper once (most recently)\n\nTheir most recent sequence has been Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper.\n\nGiven that they just played Paper, they might continue with Paper again, or switch to something new. If they play Paper again, my best move would be Scissors. If they switch to Rock (which they've done in the past after playing Paper), then my best move would be Paper. If they switch to Scissors, then my best move would be Rock.\n\nLet me also consider the payoffs. The asymmetric payoff structure means:\n- If I win with Scissors against Paper, I get +1\n- If I win with Rock against Scissors, I get +1\n- If I win with Paper against Rock, I get +3\n\nSo winning with Paper gives the highest reward. If I'm uncertain about the opponent's next move, Paper might be a good choice for the potential higher reward.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to repeat moves and their recent move was Paper, I think they might either continue with Paper or switch to Rock (which they've done after Paper in the past). Therefore, I'll go with Scissors to counter Paper.",

Currently, they've played scissors for the last 3 rounds. Based on their pattern, they might continue with scissors for another round, or they might switch to paper (which is their most common next move after scissors).\n\nSince they've played scissors for 3 rounds now, and their previous patterns suggest they might switch after 3-5 consecutive same moves, I think they might switch to paper now. If they do switch to paper, rock would be my best move.\n\nI'll play rock for this round to counter the potential paper move from my opponent.",
