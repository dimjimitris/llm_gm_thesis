Tie (0 points)\nRound 6: I played Scissors, opponent played Scissors. Tie (0 points)\nRound 7: I played Paper, opponent played Rock. I won (+1 points)\nRound 8-21: All ties with the opponent matching whatever I played.\n\nThis is interesting. It seems like my opponent may be copying my previous move. This pattern has been consistent for many rounds now.\n\nGiven this pattern, I should try to exploit it. If the opponent is indeed copying my last move, then I should play what beats my previous move:\n- If I just played Rock, I should play Paper (because opponent will likely play Rock, and Paper beats Rock)\n- If I just played Paper, I should play Scissors (because opponent will likely play Paper, and Scissors beats Paper)\n- If I just played Scissors, I should play Rock (because opponent will likely play Scissors, and Rock beats Scissors)\n\nMy last move was Rock, so if the pattern holds, my opponent will play Rock this round. Therefore, I should play Paper.",

This suggests the opponent might be mirroring my moves exactly.\n\nLet me review the entire history to confirm:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n\nFrom Round 4 onward, every single round has been a tie, with the opponent making the exact same move as me. This is extremely unlikely to happen by chance, so the opponent must be using a \"copy\" strategy - playing exactly what I played in the current round.\n\nIf that's the case, then the opponent has no way of predicting my next move. Each round is essentially independent. The best strategy against a \"mirroring\" opponent is to make unpredictable moves.\n\nHowever, since the opponent seems to be copying my exact move in the current round (not my previous move), there's no way to systematically gain an advantage. Each round will be a tie regardless of what I choose.\n\nI'll continue with my rotating pattern of rock, paper, scissors and see if anything changes.",
