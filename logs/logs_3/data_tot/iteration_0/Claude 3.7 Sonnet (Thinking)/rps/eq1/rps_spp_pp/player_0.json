    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some personas to develop a good strategy.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist; Psychological Strategist; Pattern Analyst\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a new opponent, no move has a theoretical advantage. Each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of winning, 1/3 probability of losing, and 1/3 probability of tying. Without prior information about the opponent's tendencies, we're in a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium situation.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, there are psychological factors to consider. Studies have shown that rock is the most common opening move among inexperienced players, as it psychologically represents strength and stability. If we assume our opponent might follow this tendency, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first round, we don't have data on this specific opponent's patterns yet. But we should be ready to track their moves after this to identify any patterns that might emerge in subsequent rounds.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that if we're making assumptions about human psychology, paper is a reasonable first move. However, if our opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this reasoning and choose scissors. Without more information, any of the three choices is equally valid theoretically.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's go with paper for this first round, as it counters the most common opening move (rock), while we gather more information about our opponent's tendencies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We need to consider what this tells us and what their likely next move will be.\n\nGame Theorist: In Rock-Paper-Scissors, players often exhibit certain tendencies after winning a round. They might either stick with their winning move (scissors again) due to reinforcement, or they might anticipate that we'll counter their previous move by playing rock, so they might switch to paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Many players, after winning, tend to stick with their successful move. If our opponent follows this pattern, they'll play scissors again. In that case, rock would be our optimal choice.\n\nPattern Analyst: There's also the possibility they're following a cycling pattern (rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock), which would mean they'd play rock next. In that case, paper would be optimal. However, with only one data point, it's too early to determine if they're cycling.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the limited information we have, playing rock has a reasonable expected value. It will win if they repeat scissors, tie if they switch to rock, and only lose if they switch to paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: I agree with playing rock. It counters their previous winning move, which is a common psychological pattern among players who might stick with what worked before.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

In round 2, both of us played rock (tie). So our opponent has gone from scissors to rock.\n\nGame Theorist: This pattern suggests a few possibilities: (1) After winning with scissors, they might have anticipated we would switch to rock to counter their scissors, so they switched to rock to counter our anticipated rock; (2) They could be following a rotation pattern like scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Players often react to ties by trying to win the next round. Since we both played rock, many players would anticipate their opponent staying with rock and would choose paper to win. Alternatively, some players use ties as a reset and go back to their preferred opening move.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're using a rotation strategy (scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper), they'll play paper next. If they're trying to beat what they think we'll play (which might be rock again), they'll also likely choose paper. Either way, scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The opponent seems to be playing thoughtfully rather than randomly, and both psychological and pattern-based analyses suggest paper as their likely next move. Scissors is our best counter to this.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's play scissors.

If they continue this pattern, their next move would be scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Good observation. This appears to be a classic cycling strategy. If they maintain this pattern, their next move should indeed be scissors, which means rock would be our optimal counter.\n\nPsychological Strategist: However, we need to consider that they might realize we've detected their pattern. After losing the last round, they might break their pattern deliberately. Players often change strategies after losses. But they might also assume we'll expect them to break their pattern and continue with it anyway, creating a mind game.\n\nGame Theorist: That's the classic \"thinking one level deeper\" dilemma. Given that we've only played three rounds, they might not yet believe that we've detected their pattern, so continuing with it would be reasonable from their perspective.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Three moves is enough for us to detect a pattern, but the opponent may not realize how obvious their cycling pattern appears. Rock remains our statistically best move if we assume pattern continuation.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's go with rock.

This is a naive but common strategy among beginning players.

At this point, they might realize their strategy is too predictable and change it. However, many players stick with their patterns even when losing, especially if they don't realize they're being predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Even if they suspect we've identified their pattern, they have two main options: continue the pattern or break it. If they break it, they could choose any of the three moves with roughly equal probability. If they continue, they'll definitely play rock. This makes paper our highest expected value move.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Until we see evidence of pattern breaking, we should play as if the pattern will continue.

The opponent is displaying a textbook example of a fixed rotation strategy regardless of game outcome, which makes them highly exploitable.\n\nPsychological Strategist: At this point, there's a higher chance they might realize they're being predictable and change their strategy since they've lost three times in a row. However, many players commit to their patterns even when losing, especially if they believe the pattern itself isn't the problem.\n\nPattern Analyst: Even if they're considering changing their strategy, the simplest and most likely adaptation would be to shift their rotation by one move rather than abandoning the pattern entirely.

The pattern has been maintained without any deviation throughout the game.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's play paper. It continues our successful exploitation of their predictable rotation pattern, which has given us a substantial point advantage over the course of this game.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"
