    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

From game theory perspective, the Nash equilibrium for Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play each move with equal probability (1/3). This makes your strategy unpredictable and optimal in the long run.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no data on the opponent yet, we can't identify patterns. However, studies show many players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nPsychological Strategist: Indeed, research suggests first-time players often select rock (approximately 35-36% of the time), followed by paper (around 33-35%), and scissors less frequently (29-32%). If we're playing against a fresh player, choosing paper would give us a slight statistical advantage.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the psychological insight. While a perfectly random strategy would be optimal against optimal play, using these psychological insights can give us an edge against human players or AI trained on human patterns.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's go with paper for our first move, then we can start collecting data on opponent behavior for subsequent rounds.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Agreed. Paper is statistically favorable for a first move against a new player.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

We now have one data point about their behavior.\n\nPsychological Strategist: After a tie, there are typical human patterns we should consider. Many players tend to switch to the next move in sequence after a tie, which would mean scissors (paper\u2192scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper). This is called the \"upgrading\" strategy in RPS psychology.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid observation. If we assume our opponent follows this common pattern, they would likely play scissors this round. The optimal counter to scissors would be rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Additionally, some studies show that after a tie, players are more likely to shift their strategy than to repeat the same move. The probability of them staying with paper is lower than them switching.\n\nPsychological Strategist: There's also the \"counter-prediction\" factor - they might try to anticipate our next move based on the tie. If they think we'll expect them to play scissors, they might play rock instead to counter our anticipated scissors. However, the most straightforward and common behavior after a tie is the upgrade to scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the probabilities, rock appears to be our best move for this round. It beats scissors (the most likely opponent move) and ties with rock (the second most likely move).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

We've had two consecutive ties - paper in round 1 and rock in round 2. Our opponent seems to be playing the exact same moves as us.\n\nGame Theorist: The consecutive matches could indicate our opponent is mirroring our strategy. This is a common approach in iterated games where a player copies their opponent's previous move.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Mirroring is indeed a well-documented strategy. If they're employing this tactic, they would play rock in this round (copying our last move). To counter a rock play, we should use paper.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's look at the sequence:\nRound 1: We played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\nRound 2: We played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\nThe mirroring hypothesis has strong support given the data.\n\nGame Theorist: Alternatively, they could be following their own pattern that coincidentally matched ours, or they're playing randomly and we've had coincidental ties. But the mirroring strategy is the most parsimonious explanation.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Assuming they are mirroring, our optimal move is paper. If they play rock as predicted, we win.

The strongest hypothesis is that our opponent is employing a \"copy last move\" strategy - they're playing whatever we played in the previous round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: If they are mirroring us, they would play paper in this next round (copying our last move).

If they were mirroring our previous move, they would have played paper in Round 4, not scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: The probability of four consecutive ties by pure chance is 1/81 (approximately 1.2%), which is extremely unlikely. I suspect we're dealing with one of two scenarios: either our opponent is playing the exact same move as us simultaneously, or they have some way of predicting our choices.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This pattern is too consistent to be coincidental. It seems our opponent is playing the identical move we're playing in each round, not copying our previous move. This suggests they either have insight into our decision-making process or are making identical decisions through similar reasoning.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're somehow making the exact same choice as us each time, traditional game theory doesn't help much. We're in what appears to be a \"mind-reading\" scenario.\n\nPattern Analyst: Let's try something different. Instead of using strategic reasoning, let's make a move based on a simple pattern - let's cycle through the moves in order: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.

It's like they're sending a message: \"I can tie when I want and win when I want.\"\n\nGame Theorist: In a scenario where our opponent knows our move in advance, traditional strategy becomes ineffective. The best we can achieve is a tie if we can somehow predict their move, but they seem to be determining their move based on ours.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Let's test something different. Let's play scissors and see if they continue their perfect countering with rock, or if they perhaps switch to a new pattern after these 6 wins.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Playing scissors will give us valuable information regardless of the outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"
