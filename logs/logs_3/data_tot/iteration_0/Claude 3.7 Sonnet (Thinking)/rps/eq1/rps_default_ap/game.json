Tie.\n\nLooking at my opponent's moves:\n- scissors (round 1)\n- paper (rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 19)\n- rock (rounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18)\n- scissors (round 13)\n\nMy opponent has played paper 11 times, rock 6 times, and scissors only 2 times. They've played paper most recently. After playing paper twice in a row previously (rounds 15-16), they switched to rock. There's a chance they'll make the same switch now and play rock. But they could also continue with paper if they believe I'll anticipate the switch.\n\nSince the last two rounds were ties (rock-rock and paper-paper), the opponent might try to break this pattern with scissors. \n\nBased on their overall pattern of favoring paper, and the tendency to play in streaks, I should prepare for either continued paper play or a switch to scissors to counter my paper from the last round.",

The optimal strategy against a rational opponent is to choose randomly with equal probability (1/3 for each move).\n\nHowever, there are some psychological factors that might be relevant:\n- Many people choose rock as their first move in RPS (studies have shown this tendency)\n- Paper is sometimes considered a \"smart\" first move because of the above tendency\n- Scissors is chosen least often as a first move in some studies\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose paper for my first move, as it might have a slight advantage against a first-time player who might favor rock.",

The game is perfectly balanced with each move winning against one option and losing against another. So theoretically, the optimal strategy is to choose randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each option.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological aspects to consider. Studies have shown that in the first round:\n- Many people tend to choose rock as their first move (it's seen as \"strong\" or \"stable\")\n- Paper is chosen less frequently as a first move\n- Scissors falls somewhere in between\n\nIf I were to try to exploit this tendency, I might choose paper for my first move to counter the common rock choice.

Now, they might:\n1. Continue with rock, expecting me to play scissors (thinking I'll keep countering paper)\n2. Switch to scissors, anticipating I might play paper again since it just worked\n3. Return to their favored paper\n\nGiven their history of streaking behavior with certain moves (especially paper), and the fact they've just played rock after a long paper streak, there's a decent chance they'll stick with rock for at least one more round. Paper would be the optimal counter. However, they might also try to get ahead of me and play scissors anticipating my paper.\n\nGiven their overall tendency to play paper most frequently and their rare use of scissors throughout the game, I think playing paper is the most strategic move here, despite the risk.",

Between those two, the more likely scenario is that they continue with rock since they've been on a rock streak.\n\nI'll go with paper again, which will win if they play rock and tie if they play paper.",
