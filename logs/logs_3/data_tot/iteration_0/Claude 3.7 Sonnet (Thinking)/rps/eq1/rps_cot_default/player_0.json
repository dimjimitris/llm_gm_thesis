    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

After our paper-paper tie, I need to anticipate my opponent's next move.\n\n3. Looking at their pattern after ties:\n   - After Round 1 tie (both paper): They played scissors\n   - After Round 8 tie (both scissors): They played scissors again\n\n4. A common strategy after a tie is to play what would beat the tied move - in this case, scissors would beat our mutual paper plays.\n\n5. They might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors to counter it.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might anticipate I'll try scissors and play rock.\n\n7. Given both possibilities, rock seems like the safest choice - it would beat scissors if they try to counter our mutual paper plays.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   They've played paper four consecutive times now.\n\n3. This consistency is unusual and suggests a deliberate strategy rather than random play.\n\n4. After our tie in Round 12, they continued with paper and won against my rock.\n\n5. Given their commitment to playing paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper again\n   - Expect me to finally counter with scissors and switch to rock\n\n6.

Let me analyze our complete game history:\n   - I've now lost 8 consecutive rounds, which is a significant losing streak.\n   - My opponent just played paper to beat my rock.\n   - My attempts at strategic prediction have consistently failed.\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper\n   They continue to successfully counter my moves.\n\n3. Given my long losing streak, I need a fundamental change in approach. My attempts to predict their moves based on patterns and psychology are clearly not working.\n\n4. At this point, breaking my own patterns is more important than trying to predict theirs.\n\n5. Since they just played paper, their most straightforward next move might be to play scissors, anticipating I might play paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might expect me to play scissors to counter their paper, and thus play rock.\n\n7. However, given my consistent losses, I should avoid overthinking and focus on making an unpredictable move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors"
