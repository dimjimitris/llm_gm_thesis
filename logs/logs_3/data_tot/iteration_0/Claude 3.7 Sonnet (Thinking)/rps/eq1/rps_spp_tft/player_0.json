    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, we can also consider typical first-move tendencies if we're trying to gain an edge.\n\nPsychologist: Interesting point! Research shows that rock is the most common first move among novice players - about 35-40% of people choose it initially because it's perceived as \"strong.\" Scissors is typically the second most common, while paper is chosen least frequently as a first move.\n\nStatistician: Based on those statistics, if we're playing against a fresh opponent who likely follows general human tendencies, paper would give us the highest expected value for our first move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While true randomization would be ideal for a long-term strategy, exploiting the psychological tendency toward rock makes paper a reasonable strategic choice for this opening move.\n\nPsychologist: One additional consideration - since the hint specifically mentions a \"fresh player,\" this further supports the likelihood they'll follow common patterns rather than having a developed strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to predict the opponent's adaptation.\n\nPsychologist: When players lose a round, they tend to follow one of two patterns: either they switch to what would have beaten their opponent's previous move (in this case, scissors to beat our paper), or they switch to what their opponent just played (paper). The first pattern is more common among novice players.\n\nStatistician: Based on that analysis, there's a higher probability the opponent will switch to scissors in this round to counter our previous paper move. This suggests rock would be our optimal counter-move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Since this is only the second round, the opponent is still likely using basic adaptation strategies rather than more complex patterns. Rock gives us the best expected value against a likely scissors play.\n\nPsychologist: One additional point - since the opponent just lost with rock, they're psychologically less likely to play it again immediately. This further increases the probability they'll switch to scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The pattern appears to be emerging - the opponent seems to be following a common novice strategy.\n\nPsychologist: Yes, I'm noticing a specific pattern here. The opponent first played rock, then after losing, switched to scissors. This aligns with a common behavior where players switch to what would have beaten their own previous move - scissors beats their previous rock.\n\nStatistician: If this pattern holds, we can predict their next move with higher confidence. Following the pattern of \"play what would beat my previous move,\" they should play paper next (since paper beats their previous scissors).\n\nGame Theorist: Exactly. If we assume they're following this pattern, scissors would be our optimal counter to their likely paper play.\n\nPsychologist: While there's always a chance they might break the pattern or use more sophisticated reasoning, the evidence from the first two rounds strongly suggests they're using this simple adaptation strategy. At this early stage of the game, continuing to exploit this pattern gives us the highest expected value.\n\nStatistician: I concur. The probability suggests scissors is our best move, though we should be prepared to adapt if they change their strategy after this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Based on this analysis, if they play rock next, our optimal counter would be paper.\n\nGame Theorist: While I agree paper is likely our best move, we should acknowledge that three consecutive losses might trigger a pattern break. Players often change strategies after multiple failures.\n\nPsychologist: That's a valid concern. However, research shows many players still follow their established pattern for at least one more round before making a significant strategy shift. The psychological threshold for abandoning a strategy often comes after 3-4 losses.\n\nStatistician: Even accounting for an increased probability of pattern deviation, paper still gives us the highest expected value based on the observed data.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They might attempt to break the cycle with a completely different approach.\n\nPsychologist: Agreed. After four losses, many players reach a psychological breaking point and abandon their previous strategy. They might attempt to predict our move instead, or even revert to randomization.\n\nStatistician: Despite these considerations, the pattern has been so consistent that rock remains our highest expected value move.

However, five consecutive losses represents an extreme psychological pressure point.\n\nPsychologist: You're right. Five losses is typically well beyond the threshold where most players would abandon a failing strategy.
