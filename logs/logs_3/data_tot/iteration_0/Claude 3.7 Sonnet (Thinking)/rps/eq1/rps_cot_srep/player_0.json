    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Steps:\n\n1. Let's review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.\n\n2. Looking specifically at what happens after paper ties:\n   - After Round 7 (paper tie), my opponent played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 10 (paper tie), my opponent played scissors in Round 11\n   - After Round 13 (paper tie), my opponent played scissors in Round 14\n   - After Round 16 (paper tie), my opponent played scissors in Round 17\n\n3. There's a very consistent pattern here - after we tie with paper, my opponent plays scissors in the next round. This has happened four times without deviation.\n\n4. Given this strong pattern and the fact we just tied with paper again in Round 23, there's a high probability they'll play scissors in this round.\n\n5. If I anticipate they'll play scissors (following their established pattern), my optimal counter is rock.\n\n[move] rock"
