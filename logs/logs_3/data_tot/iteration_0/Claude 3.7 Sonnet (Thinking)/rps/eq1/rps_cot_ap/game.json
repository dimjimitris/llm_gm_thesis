In the absence of such information, the Nash equilibrium strategy is to choose each option (rock, paper, scissors) with equal probability (1/3).\n\nHowever, there are some psychological aspects to consider:\n1. Rock is often the most common first move for beginners or casual players (some studies suggest around 35% of first moves are rock).\n2. Paper is statistically the least chosen option in many studies.\n3. People who perceive themselves as strategic might avoid rock as too obvious and choose paper or scissors.\n\nGiven these considerations, I could choose paper which would beat the commonly chosen rock. But this is still just a heuristic and not guaranteed.\n\nWithout more information about my opponent, I'll choose paper as my first move, which would win against rock (the statistically most common first move) and lose against scissors (which is less commonly chosen first).\n\nMy strategy: Choose paper for the first round, and then adjust my strategy based on what my opponent does in subsequent rounds if we continue playing.",

The logical move would be to finally switch to scissors, anticipating that I'll play paper again.\n\nGiven their history of strong move preferences and their recent losses with rock, I believe they'll finally switch to scissors to try to break my winning streak. I should counter this with rock.\n\nHowever, there's also a possibility they might be stubborn and continue with rock despite the losses. But given that they've now lost twice with it, that seems less likely. The more strategic move would be for them to switch to scissors.",

This represents a MAJOR shift - they've broken their 8-round rock streak and returned to paper\n3.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Continue with paper since it just worked\n2. Switch to scissors thinking I might play paper to counter their paper\n3. Finally try rock (though this seems least likely given their history)\n\nSince they just beat me with paper, and they've shown a tendency to repeat successful moves, they might play paper again. If I play scissors, I'll beat their paper.\n\nHowever, if they're thinking strategically, they might anticipate my scissors counter and play rock. But given they haven't played rock in 10 rounds, this seems less likely.\n\nGiven their strong paper bias and their win with it just now, I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper play.",
