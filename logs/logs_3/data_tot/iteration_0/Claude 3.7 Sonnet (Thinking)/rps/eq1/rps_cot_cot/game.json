Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's strategy or tendencies.\n3. In games without prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal theoretical win probability.\n4. However, studies suggest \"rock\" is often chosen as a first move by many players - perhaps because it feels strong or stable psychologically.\n5. Given this tendency, playing \"paper\" might give me a slight advantage against a potential \"rock\" opener.\n6. While my opponent could be thinking the same way and choose scissors, I need to make a decision with limited information.\n7.

The tie in round 13 breaks my opponent's winning streak and gives me new information.\n\n3. Looking at their recent moves:\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Scissors\n\n4. They were following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern but then broke it by playing scissors again.\n\n5. Since we both played scissors last round, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors thinking I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll keep playing scissors\n   - Play paper thinking I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors\n\n6. Given their adaptive strategy, I think they're most likely to switch to rock, anticipating I'll repeat scissors.\n\n7. To counter this likely rock move, I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Given their repeated scissors play, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors for a third time (if they believe it's working)\n   - Anticipate I'll play rock to counter their scissors and switch to paper\n   - Try to be unpredictable by switching to rock\n\n5.

I'm starting fresh against another player, so I have no prior information on their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. In a single game with no prior information, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n4. Some standard strategies in Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n   - Random selection\n   - Psychology (anticipating what the opponent might choose based on human tendencies)\n   - Pattern recognition (not applicable in this first round)\n\n5. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent, I could:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Use knowledge about common first moves in Rock-Paper-Scissors\n\n6. According to some studies, \"rock\" is a common first move for many players (due to psychological reasons - it feels \"strong\" or \"stable\"). So playing \"paper\" might be slightly advantageous.\n\n7.

Stick with scissors if they think it's working well\n2. Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\nAt this point, I need to be as unpredictable as possible. The opponent has shown they can read my patterns well.
