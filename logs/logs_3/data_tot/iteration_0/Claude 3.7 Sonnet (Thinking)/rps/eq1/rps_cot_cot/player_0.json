    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's strategy or tendencies.\n3. In games without prior information, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal theoretical win probability.\n4. However, studies suggest \"rock\" is often chosen as a first move by many players - perhaps because it feels strong or stable psychologically.\n5. Given this tendency, playing \"paper\" might give me a slight advantage against a potential \"rock\" opener.\n6. While my opponent could be thinking the same way and choose scissors, I need to make a decision with limited information.\n7. I'll choose paper for this first round as a strategic counter to the common rock opener.\n\n[move] paper"

They've played the perfect counter to each of my moves, suggesting they might be predicting my strategy or I'm being too predictable.\n\n5. Their last three moves follow the sequence rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which is a complete cycle of the game's options.\n\n6. If they continue this cycling pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n7. However, they might also be adaptively countering me based on my previous patterns.\n\n8. To break this losing streak, I need to disrupt any predictable pattern they've detected in my play.\n\n9. I'll play scissors, which would beat their paper if they continue the rock-scissors-paper cycle.\n\n[move] scissors"

They were following a rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern but then broke it by playing scissors again.\n\n5. Since we both played scissors last round, they might:\n   - Stick with scissors thinking I'll play scissors again\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll keep playing scissors\n   - Play paper thinking I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors\n\n6. Given their adaptive strategy, I think they're most likely to switch to rock, anticipating I'll repeat scissors.\n\n7. To counter this likely rock move, I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Rounds 14-22: I've now lost 12 consecutive rounds\n\n2. My opponent has consistently countered my every move with extraordinary accuracy.\n\n3. Their recent sequence of moves:\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Round 21: Paper\n   - Round 22: Rock\n\n4. There appears to be a pattern in their last 4 moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. If they continue this pattern, they would play Scissors next.\n\n5. However, pattern recognition clearly hasn't been working for me.\n\n6. Since all strategic approaches have failed, I'll try a fundamental rock-paper-scissors strategy: play what would beat their last move.\n\n7. Their last move was Rock, so I'll play Paper to counter it.\n\n[move] paper"
