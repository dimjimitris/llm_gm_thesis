There are some psychological aspects to consider:\n1. Rock is often a common first choice for many players as it feels \"strong\" or \"stable\"\n2.

Based on this, I should play scissors to counter paper. However, looking at the broader pattern, my opponent seems to be adaptive and might anticipate this move. They could potentially switch to rock to counter my scissors.\n\nI've been losing more than winning overall, so I need to be more strategic. Given that my opponent just played paper, and looking at their behavior throughout the game, I'll try scissors for this round.",

However, it could also be that they're trying to counter what they expect me to play.\n\nGiven I just played Scissors and my opponent matched with Scissors, they might expect me to play Rock next (to beat their expected Scissors). If they're thinking that way, they might play Paper to counter my expected Rock.\n\nI think I'll go with Paper for this round, predicting my opponent will play Rock.

My reasoning is:\n1. I just won with paper, so my opponent might expect me to play paper again\n2. If they expect paper, they might play scissors to counter\n3.

If they're using a simple strategy, they might play rock again since it lost (expecting me to change). If they expect me to play paper again (since I just won with it), they might play scissors. So the safest bet is to play rock, which beats scissors and ties with rock.\n\nActually, I'll go with rock as my final decision.",
