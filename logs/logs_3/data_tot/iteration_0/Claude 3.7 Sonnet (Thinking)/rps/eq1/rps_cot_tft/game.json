I'm playing against a fresh player, which means there's no prior history to analyze.\n\nLet me think about my strategy:\n\n1. In a single game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with a new opponent, there's no established pattern to exploit.\n\n2. Since this is the first move, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value in a purely random game.\n\n3. However, studies have shown that in Rock-Paper-Scissors, there are some common tendencies among first-time players:\n   - Rock is often a popular first choice for many players\n   - Some people consider paper to be \"weak\" so they might avoid it on first moves\n   - Scissors falls somewhere in between\n\n4. Given these tendencies, if I assume my opponent might slightly favor rock as their first move, the optimal counter would be paper.\n\n5. However, if my opponent is thinking strategically as well, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\n6. This is the classic game theory problem - there is no deterministic best move in a simultaneous game with a rational opponent who is also trying to predict your move.\n\n7. In the absence of any pattern or history, the Nash equilibrium strategy for Rock-Paper-Scissors is to choose each option with 1/3 probability.\n\n8.

Let me analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence has been consistently cycling through: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors...\n\n3. Since they just lost with scissors in Round 23, following their established pattern, they will almost certainly play paper next.\n\n4. The best counter to paper is scissors.\n\n5. I've won 22 consecutive rounds by predicting their moves based on this pattern, giving me extremely high confidence in this prediction.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, anticipating they'll play paper following their consistent cycle.\n\n[move] scissors",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately.
