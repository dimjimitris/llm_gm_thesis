    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes your strategy unpredictable and prevents exploitation. However, we should consider potential first-move tendencies in human players.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Research suggests that in the first round of Rock-Paper-Scissors, many players tend to choose rock as their opening move. There's a psychological comfort in the perceived \"strength\" of rock. Paper would be a reasonable counter to this tendency.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since this is our first move and we're facing a \"fresh player,\" we don't have specific pattern data to work with. We can either follow the game theory approach of randomization or make a strategic guess based on psychological insights.\n\nGame Theorist: If we're making just one move without repeat play considerations, exploiting common first-move biases might give a slight edge over perfect randomization.\n\nPsychological Analyst: One more consideration - if the opponent thinks strategically, they might anticipate the \"rock bias\" and play paper instead. In that case, scissors would be optimal.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's go with paper for this first move. It counters the common first-move rock, and if they do play scissors anticipating our paper, we'll learn from that for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This tells us something about our opponent's thinking process.\n\nPsychological Analyst: When players tie with paper, there's often a tendency to switch to scissors in the next round, assuming the opponent might play paper again. However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and play rock instead.\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, we shouldn't establish predictable patterns. Since our opponent knows we played paper last time, they might expect us to shift to something else. \n\nStrategic Planner: Let's consider the most likely scenarios. If our opponent thinks we'll play paper again, they'll play scissors. If they think we'll switch to scissors (to beat their paper), they'll play rock. If they think we'll go to rock (anticipating their scissors), they'll stay with paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given we've only played one round, most casual players tend to cycle through the options. Since they played paper first, many players would naturally move to scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter a likely scissors play, rock would be our best move.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree.

Either our opponent is remarkably aligned with our thinking process, or they might be employing a specific strategy. The sequence so far is paper \u2192 rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The natural completion of this pattern would be scissors. Many players subconsciously follow a paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors rotation. If they follow this pattern, they'll likely play scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: However, if they're sophisticated, they might anticipate that we're thinking this and deliberately break the pattern. \n\nStrategic Planner: We have three main possibilities:\n1.

They'll play something unexpected to break any pattern recognition\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that we've seen two consecutive ties, I believe our opponent is likely following similar reasoning patterns to ours. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, when players have similar strategic thinking levels, they often arrive at the same conclusions.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter the most likely move (scissors), we should play rock.

Three consecutive ties suggests our opponent might be using a mirroring strategy, or we're both following extremely similar decision-making patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're mirroring our moves, they somehow predicted our paper on the first round, then accurately anticipated our switches. More likely, we're both using similar strategic thinking.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze what they might do next. After two consecutive rocks:\n1. They might expect us to play rock again, so they'll play paper\n2. They might expect us to switch to paper (to beat their rock), so they'll play scissors\n3. They might just play rock again if they believe this pattern will continue\n\nPsychological Analyst: After multiple ties, there's strong psychological pressure to break the pattern.

Now that we've won with scissors, our opponent will likely adapt their strategy.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Players who just lost tend to become more defensive. They'll likely expect us to play scissors again (since it worked), and will counter with rock. This is a common reaction - countering the move that just defeated you.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The most rational expectation is that they'll play rock to counter our previous successful scissors move. Therefore, paper would be our optimal counter.\n\nStrategic Planner: There's another possibility - they might think we're becoming predictable after our win and try to get ahead of our thinking.

There's no clear mathematical pattern, but they haven't played scissors at all, which is significant.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After losing twice in a row, the opponent is likely feeling pressure. Players who lose consecutive rounds often make one of two moves: either they become unpredictable (to break their losing pattern) or they become more predictable (reverting to comfort moves).\n\nStrategic Planner: Given they've lost with both paper and rock, and haven't yet played scissors at all, there's a higher probability they might finally play scissors to break their losing streak.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The fact they haven't played scissors in five rounds makes it statistically more likely to appear now. Additionally, they might recognize we've accurately predicted their last two moves and try something completely different.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also the consideration that they've lost to both paper and scissors, so rock might feel like their \"safest\" option psychologically.

An interesting pattern is emerging - they seem to be alternating between paper and rock in the last three rounds, and they still haven't played scissors at all.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After breaking their losing streak with a win, they're likely feeling validated in their strategy. The fact they won with paper might reinforce this choice, but they've shown a tendency to alternate, so rock might be their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the recent pattern, there's an oscillation between paper and rock. If this pattern holds, they would play rock next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Also noteworthy is they have completely avoided scissors through six rounds.
