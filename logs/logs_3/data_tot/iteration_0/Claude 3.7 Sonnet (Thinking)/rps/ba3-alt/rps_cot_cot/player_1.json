    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\n2. Analyzing the risk/reward for each move:\n   - Rock: Highest potential gain (+3 if opponent plays paper), moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Paper: Moderate gain (+1 if opponent plays scissors), highest risk (-3 if opponent plays rock)\n   - Scissors: Moderate gain (+1 if opponent plays rock), moderate risk (-1 if opponent plays paper)\n\n3. Since this is the first round with no prior information about my opponent, I should choose the option with the best potential payoff relative to risk.\n\n4. Rock offers the highest potential payoff (+3) with only a moderate downside (-1), making it mathematically the strongest opening move.\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluating my options:\n   - Playing rock again: 0 points if tie, -3 if opponent plays paper, +1 if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing paper: +1 point if opponent plays rock, 0 if tie, -1 if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing scissors: -1 if opponent plays rock, +3 if opponent plays paper, 0 if tie\n\n4.

Analyzing opponent's pattern:\n   - Their last six moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Their pattern had been alternating between scissors and rock, but they just played rock twice\n   - This could indicate a change in strategy or a mistake in their pattern\n\n4.

Reviewing complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 3: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 5: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 13: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 14: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost (-1)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3)\n   - Round 20: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 21: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 22: Both rock (tie)\n\n2. Analyzing opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They've matched my last three moves exactly (scissors twice, then rock)\n   - Strong evidence they're using a mirroring strategy\n   - Overall they've played rock 10 times, scissors 9 times, paper only 3 times\n\n3. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they continue mirroring, we'll tie regardless of what I play\n   - To break this pattern of ties, I need to anticipate their potential deviation\n   - Paper has won against their scissors (+1) multiple times (rounds 2, 4, 15)\n   - Scissors has won against their rock (+1) twice (rounds 12, 17)\n\n4. Decision making:\n   - Paper provides good upside if they play scissors (which they've done frequently)\n   - If they continue mirroring, we'll tie (better than losing)\n   - Need to break this series of ties with a calculated risk\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing opponent's behavior:\n   - They broke their mirroring pattern by playing scissors against my paper\n   - Their move distribution: rock (10), scissors (10), paper (3)\n   - Rock has been their most frequent move overall\n\n3. Move performance analysis:\n   - Scissors has been my most successful move (2 wins, 0 losses, 5 ties = +2 net points)\n   - Paper has mixed results (3 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties = -9 net points)\n   - Rock has been ineffective (0 wins, 2 losses, 4 ties = -2 net points)\n\n4. Strategic decision:\n   - If they revert to their base strategy, rock is likely\n   - Scissors has been consistently successful against their rock plays\n   - Scissors offers the best risk/reward profile for this round\n\n[move] scissors"
