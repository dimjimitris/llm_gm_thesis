    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure of this rock-paper-scissors variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a new player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, rock has the highest potential reward (+3) when it wins against paper, but can lose to scissors (-1).\n\n4. Paper has a moderate win potential (+1) against scissors, but suffers the highest possible loss (-3) against rock.\n\n5. Scissors has moderate outcomes: +1 when winning against rock, -1 when losing against paper.\n\n6. Given this asymmetric reward structure, rock appears to offer the best risk-reward balance for an initial move - highest potential gain and moderate potential loss.\n\n7. Since many new players might choose rock in their first move (as it's a common initial choice), scissors could be strategically sound to counter this tendency.\n\n8. However, without knowing my opponent's tendencies, I'll go with the move that offers the highest potential reward.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's move distribution:\n   - Scissors: 11 times (including the last 4 rounds consecutively)\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 3 times\n\n3. Looking at their recent pattern:\n   - They've now played scissors four times in a row, showing unprecedented persistence with this move\n   - When I play paper against their scissors, I win\n   - When I play rock against their scissors, I lose\n\n4. This suggests they've identified a pattern in my play and are deliberately sticking with scissors to counter my attempts to predict their moves.\n\n5. Given their extraordinarily consistent use of scissors recently (far beyond their earlier pattern of switching after 2-3 repetitions), the optimal counter is clear.\n\n6. Paper beats scissors in this game variant, giving me +1 point.\n\n7. While there's always a chance they might finally switch moves, the evidence strongly suggests they're committed to scissors, making paper the most rational choice.\n\n[move] paper"

There are several possible explanations for their persistence:\n   - They're testing if I'll eventually change my strategy\n   - They're setting up for a sudden change once I establish a pattern\n   - They're simply being stubborn with their most frequent move\n\n5. Given this unprecedented persistence with scissors, I need to decide:\n   - Continue countering with paper (which keeps winning)\n   - Anticipate they'll finally switch (possibly to rock)\n\n6. Given that they've shown such extraordinary commitment to scissors (5 times in a row), and the pattern of winning when I play paper against it, the most rational choice is to continue with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

This significant change in strategy after such persistent scissors play suggests:\n   - They were waiting for me to establish a pattern (playing paper repeatedly)\n   - They're capable of making strategic adjustments\n   - They may follow a win-stay strategy after this successful change\n\n5. Given that they just had success with rock, there's a strong likelihood they'll stick with it for at least another round.\n\n6. If they play rock again, my best counter is scissors (+1 point).\n\n7. Even if they switch back to scissors or to paper, scissors offers a balanced risk profile (tie against scissors, -1 against paper).\n\n[move] scissors"
