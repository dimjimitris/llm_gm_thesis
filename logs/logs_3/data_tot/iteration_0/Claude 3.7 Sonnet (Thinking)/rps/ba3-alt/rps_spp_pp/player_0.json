    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Unlike traditional Rock Paper Scissors, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Same moves: Tie, 0 points\n\nThis means Rock is high-risk, high-reward. If you win with Rock, you get +3, but if you lose with Rock, you lose -3. Paper and Scissors have lower stakes.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we can't identify patterns yet. But we should note that in classic RPS games, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move. However, given the modified payoff structure, they might behave differently.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: For the first move, we should consider the risk-reward balance. Playing Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Playing Paper or Scissors limits both our potential gain and loss to \u00b11. Since we're facing a fresh player with no established patterns, I suggest starting with a more balanced approach.\n\nGame Theory Expert: In a single-shot game with no prior information, any of the three moves could be optimal. However, given the asymmetric payoffs, Paper might be a reasonable first move. It protects against Rock (which many players choose first) and if we lose to Scissors, we only lose 1 point instead of the 3 points we'd lose if we chose Rock and lost to Scissors.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: I agree. Paper balances risk and reward reasonably for a first move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

We played Paper, and our opponent played Scissors, and according to the hint, we won and scored 1 point. This confirms that the rules given earlier were correct - paper beats scissors in this variant.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Yes, this is the reverse of traditional Rock Paper Scissors rules. To clarify:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nFor our next move, we should consider that our opponent might adjust their strategy after losing.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: Our opponent now knows we won with Paper. They might anticipate us playing Paper again and adjust accordingly. In traditional game theory, players often change strategies after losing.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Since our opponent chose Scissors in round 1, they might:\n1. Switch to Rock, thinking we'll play Paper again\n2. Switch to Paper to counter our potential move to Rock\n3. Stick with Scissors, hoping we'll switch to Rock\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given these possibilities, what's our optimal move? If they switch to Rock, our best move is Scissors (we'd win +1). If they switch to Paper, our best move is Rock (we'd win +3). If they stick with Scissors, our best move is Paper again (we'd win +1).\n\nRisk Management Advisor: Rock gives us the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3). Since this is just the second round and we're still establishing patterns, I recommend playing Scissors. If they switch to Rock (a common adjustment after losing), we'd lose only 1 point. If they switch to Paper, we'd win 1 point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I concur. Scissors balances potential gains and losses for this round while we gather more information about our opponent's strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

We played Scissors, our opponent played Rock, and we won again (+1). This confirms that in this variant, Scissors beats Rock. Our record so far:\n- Round 1: We played Paper, they played Scissors, we won (+1)\n- Round 2: We played Scissors, they played Rock, we won (+1)\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent's moves suggest they might be following a pattern. They've played Scissors\u2192Rock so far. In traditional RPS, a common pattern is to cycle through all three options (Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper). If they continue this pattern, they'll play Paper next.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: Based on the payoff structure, if they play Paper, our best counter would be Rock, giving us +3 points. That's a significant potential gain.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: There's another possibility - the opponent might be confused about the rules. Perhaps they're trying to counter our moves using traditional RPS logic, not realizing this game has reversed rules. They might expect us to play Scissors again (since we won with it) and try to counter with Rock again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's assess our options:\n- If we play Rock and they play Paper: we win +3 points\n- If we play Rock and they play Rock: we tie (0 points)\n- If we play Rock and they play Scissors: we lose -1 points\n\nThe expected value seems highest with Rock, especially if there's a good chance they'll play Paper (continuing a potential cycle).\n\nRisk Management Advisor: I agree. Rock offers the highest potential reward (+3) with manageable risk. Even if we're wrong, we'd either tie or lose only 1 point. It's worth the calculated risk at this stage.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

They're cycling through all options sequentially (Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors?)\n2. They're using traditional RPS logic but don't understand this game has reversed winning conditions\n\nRisk Management Advisor: We've accumulated +5 points so far.

If they're using traditional logic, they might think our Rock beat their Paper, so they might play Scissors to beat what they think will be our Paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's evaluate our options for this round:\n- If we play Paper and they play Scissors: we win +1\n- If we play Rock and they play Scissors: we lose -1\n- If we play Scissors and they play Scissors: we tie (0)\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: Since both major theories about their strategy (cycling or traditional RPS thinking) suggest they'll play Scissors next, Paper would be our optimal move. It would continue our winning streak and add another point.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: Paper is indeed the safest bet with the best expected outcome based on the pattern we've observed.

If they maintain this pattern, they'll play Rock next. According to this game's rules, Scissors beats Rock, so we should play Scissors to win +1 more point.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: We've accumulated +6 points so far without any losses. The opponent seems locked into their pattern, showing no adaptability despite losing every round. This strongly suggests they'll continue their cycling behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: I agree. The pattern is clear: they're cycling through Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock...

Let's review all rounds:\n- Round 1: We played Paper, they played Scissors, we won (+1)\n- Round 2: We played Scissors, they played Rock, we won (+1)\n- Round 3: We played Rock, they played Paper, we won (+3)\n- Round 4: We played Paper, they played Scissors, we won (+1)\n- Round 5: We played Scissors, they played Rock, we won (+1)\n- Round 6: We played Rock, they played Paper, we won (+3)\n- Round 7: We played Paper, they played Scissors, we won (+1)\n- Round 8: We played Scissors, they played Rock, we won (+1)\n- Round 9: We played Rock, they played Paper, we won (+3)\n\nThe opponent's cycling pattern has remained perfectly consistent through nine rounds: Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock\u2192Paper... Following this pattern, they will play Scissors next.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Nine consecutive accurate predictions gives us near certainty about their strategy. They're using a completely deterministic approach despite losing every round. Given their likely next move of Scissors, our optimal counter is Paper, which would give us another +1 point.\n\nRisk Management Advisor: We've accumulated +15 points without any losses. The opponent has shown absolutely no adaptation. While it's theoretically possible they might finally change their strategy after nine consecutive losses, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests they'll continue their pattern.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: The probability of them breaking the pattern at this point is extremely low. All evidence supports playing Paper to counter their expected Scissors move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Paper is clearly our optimal move for round 10. I see no strategic reason to deviate from our successful counter-strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"
