    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a modified rock-paper-scissors with unbalanced scoring:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 points\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 points\nThe higher risk-reward is with rock-paper interactions.\n\nStrategic Planner: The first move against a fresh player is strategic. We don't have prior information about their tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, people often start with rock, but this game has different incentives.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, rock offers the highest potential gain (+3) but also the highest potential loss (-3). Paper has medium risk-reward profile, while scissors has the lowest potential impact.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First-time players often gravitate toward rock in their opening move. Given the scoring system, if the opponent plays rock, paper would be optimal (+1). However, if they anticipate this and play scissors, we'd lose only 1 point instead of 3.\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper seems like a reasonable first move balancing potential gain and loss. If opponent plays rock (common first move), we gain 1 point. If they play scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they play paper, it's a tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper provides the best risk-adjusted expected value for our opening move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

According to these unusual rules, paper beats scissors (not the standard RPS rules). Our opponent chose scissors and lost 1 point, while we gained 1 point.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing, players often switch strategies. The opponent might anticipate we'll play paper again and adjust accordingly. In this modified game, if they want to beat paper, they would choose rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: If opponent switches to rock to counter our paper, we should play scissors which beats rock. This would give us another +1 point. However, if they anticipate this and play paper instead, we'd lose 3 points.\n\nStrategic Planner: We need to balance potential gains against losses. In standard sequential RPS psychology, players often rotate after a loss. Given our opponent just lost with scissors, they may switch to rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's also consider the mixed strategy equilibrium. Given the asymmetric payoffs, a rational opponent should play rock more frequently because of its higher potential payoff.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Since this is just the second round, the opponent is likely still testing strategies. Playing scissors now could be effective if they indeed switch to rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: I support the scissors move. It has potential gain of +1 and worst-case loss of -1, compared to the -3 risk with paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

Our scissors beat our opponent's rock in the last round, giving us another +1 point. The opponent has now lost with both scissors and rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has lost twice in a row with different moves. Psychologically, they may be getting frustrated and will likely switch to their last remaining option - paper. Players often cycle through all options when losing repeatedly.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we anticipate the opponent will play paper next, our optimal counter would be rock, which would give us +3 points.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock is a higher-risk play with potential for +3 points if opponent plays paper, but -1 if they play scissors. Given the opponent's previous moves (scissors then rock), paper seems unlikely as their next move unless they're deliberately cycling through options.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent might also be analyzing our pattern. We've played paper then scissors, so they might expect us to play rock next in a cycling pattern. If they anticipate this, they might play paper to counter.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After consecutive losses, many players resort to what they perceive as the \"strongest\" move. In this modified game, rock has the highest potential payoff at +3, which might make it psychologically appealing to a losing player.\n\nStrategic Planner: I suggest we play scissors again. If the opponent plays rock again (perhaps believing in its strength), we win. If they play paper to counter our expected rock, scissors still beats paper in this game.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with scissors. It maintains our current successful strategy and has a balanced risk profile with maximum loss of only -1.\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors it is.

We lost the last round with scissors against the opponent's paper. Looking at the opponent's pattern so far, they've played scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, which is a complete cycle through all moves.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: This cycling pattern is quite common in RPS games. If they continue this pattern, their next move would likely be scissors again. Also, they've now experienced a win, which might reinforce their current strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we predict they'll play scissors next, according to this game's rules, we should play paper to beat scissors (+1 points). However, we need to be cautious - they might be adapting to our moves rather than simply cycling.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's review our moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. We've played scissors twice in a row and just lost with it. The opponent might anticipate us switching away from scissors now.\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent is following a simple cycling strategy (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), then paper would be our best counter. But if they're anticipating our adaptation, they might expect us to play rock (to counter their expected scissors), in which case they might play paper again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a win, many players stick with their winning move. There's a decent chance they'll play paper again since it just worked for them.\n\nStrategic Planner: If there's a higher probability they'll play paper again, then rock would be our optimal move, giving us +3 points if successful.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock carries more risk (-1 if they play scissors) but also higher reward (+3 if they play paper).

They've completed a full cycle and returned to scissors. This suggests they might be using a simple rotation strategy.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue this pattern, their next move would be rock. To counter rock, we should play paper, which would give us +1 point.\n\nRisk Analyst: Our score is currently at 0 after winning two rounds and losing two. The opponent may be catching onto patterns, so we need to be careful about being too predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent's consistent cycling suggests either a predetermined strategy or they're not adapting to our moves.

However, in RPS games, many players stick with simple rotations even when they're being countered.\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper is our safest bet.
