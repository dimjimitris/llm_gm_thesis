    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure of this modified game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n   \n2. Comparing potential gains and losses for each move:\n   - Rock: potential to win 3 points, risk of losing 1 point\n   - Paper: potential to win 1 point, risk of losing 3 points\n   - Scissors: potential to win 1 point, risk of losing 1 point\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information on their tendencies.\n\n4. Rock has the most favorable risk-reward ratio - highest possible gain (3 points) with minimal potential loss (1 point).\n\n5. While my opponent might anticipate this and choose scissors, the overall expected value of rock appears highest.\n\n[move] rock"

Reviewing the rules to ensure clarity:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3 (I just successfully utilized this)\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n\n3. Analyzing opponent's recent strategy:\n   - They've now played paper twice in a row\n   - This suggests they might be starting a new paper streak\n   - They may also adapt to my successful rock play\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They might continue with paper if following their streak pattern\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock\n   - They might play rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\n5. Given their pattern of repeated moves and my success with rock, I'll play rock again - it has the highest payoff potential if they stick with paper.\n\n[move] rock"
