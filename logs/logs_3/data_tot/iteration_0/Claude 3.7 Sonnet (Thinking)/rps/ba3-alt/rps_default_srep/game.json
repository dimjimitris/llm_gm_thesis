However, their pattern so far suggests they might continue with scissors.\n\nGiven the scoring system, if I play paper:\n- Against scissors: Win +1 point\n- Against rock: Lose -3 points\n- Against paper: Tie 0 points\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- Against paper: Lose -1 point\n- Against rock: Win +1 point\n- Against scissors: Tie 0 points\n\nIf I play rock:\n- Against paper: Win +3 points\n- Against scissors: Lose -1 point\n- Against rock: Tie 0 points\n\nGiven my opponent's strong scissors tendency, but considering they might finally adapt, I'll stick with paper one more time. If they continue with scissors, I'll win again. If they switch, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let's think about the payoff structure:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Tie: 0 points for both\n\nWait, I think I misread the rules initially. Let me re-read them:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Tie: 0 points for both\n\nActually, I think I got confused by the description. Let me re-interpret:\n- Paper beats rock (standard RPS)\n- Rock beats scissors (standard RPS)\n- Scissors beats paper (standard RPS)\n\nBut the point values are different:\n- Winning with paper gives 1 point, losing with rock costs -1 point\n- Winning with rock gives 3 points, losing with scissors costs -3 points\n- Winning with scissors gives 1 point, losing with paper costs -1 point\n\nSo this is an asymmetric payoff version of rock-paper-scissors. Rock is the highest value move to win with, but also the costliest to lose with.\n\nFor the first move against a fresh player who doesn't know my strategy yet, I could:\n1. Play rock - highest reward if I win, but highest penalty if I lose\n2. Play paper - moderate reward if I win, moderate penalty if I lose\n3. Play scissors - moderate reward if I win, moderate penalty if I lose\n\nSince it's the first round, I don't have information about the other player's tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, a common first move is rock, so I could counter that with paper. However, if they're thinking strategically, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs, rock has the highest potential gain and loss. Since I don't have information yet, I'll go with paper as my first move, which has a moderate risk-reward profile.",

The opponent seems to heavily favor scissors even though it's losing against my paper strategy. Given this clear tendency, my best move is to continue with paper. They've shown only minimal adaptation despite repeated losses with scissors, so it's highly likely they'll play scissors again.\n\nThe paper strategy has consistently earned me points, while my attempts to play rock have backfired since scissors beats rock in this variant of the game.",
