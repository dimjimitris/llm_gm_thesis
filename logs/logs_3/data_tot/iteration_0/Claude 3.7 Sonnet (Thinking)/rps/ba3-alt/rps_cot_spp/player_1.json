    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Rock beating paper gives 3 points (highest reward) while the other winning combinations only give 1 point. This suggests that playing rock has the highest potential reward, but also the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays rock).\n\nPsychological Analyst: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" we don't have data on their past behavior. However, in first rounds, many players tend to play rock as their opening move since it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" We should consider this possibility.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's calculate expected values. If opponent distributions are uniform (1/3 probability for each move):\n- Paper: (0 + 3 - 1)/3 = 2/3 points on average\n- Rock: (-1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0 points on average\n- Scissors: (1 - 3 + 0)/3 = -2/3 points on average\n\nBased on this, paper has the highest expected value if the opponent plays randomly.\n\nDecision Maker: Given that this is the first round against a new player, and considering both the mathematical expected value and psychological factors, I suggest playing paper. It has the highest expected value against random play, and it also counters the common first-move tendency toward rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Now we need to think about the opponent's likely strategy for round 2.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, many players tend to switch their move, expecting their opponent to do the same. The opponent might anticipate we'll switch to scissors (to counter their previous paper) and thus switch to rock themselves. However, some players also stick with a non-losing move, thinking it's safe.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If opponent plays paper again: Paper (tie, 0 pts), Rock (loss, -3 pts), Scissors (win, 1 pt)\n- If opponent switches to rock: Paper (loss, -3 pts), Rock (tie, 0 pts), Scissors (loss, -1 pt)\n- If opponent switches to scissors: Paper (win, 1 pt), Rock (win, 3 pts), Scissors (tie, 0 pts)\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the asymmetric payoff structure, scissors is quite interesting here. If the opponent repeats paper, we win 1 point. If they switch to scissors, we tie (0 points). The only bad scenario is if they switch to rock, where we lose 1 point - but that's still better than the -3 we could lose with other choices.\n\nDecision Maker: Given the analysis, scissors seems like our best move. It capitalizes if the opponent repeats their paper play, ties if they switch to scissors, and minimizes our loss if they switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let's think through our next move carefully.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent might be confused by the reversed rule where scissors beats rock. They might:\n1. Switch to paper (thinking it beats scissors per traditional rules)\n2. Stick with rock (if they didn't understand why they lost)\n3. Try scissors (to match our previous winning move)\n\nGame Theorist: Let's evaluate the current mental state of our opponent. They lost with rock against scissors, which is contrary to traditional rock-paper-scissors. They might adjust based on the unusual payoff matrix, or they might play according to traditional rules expecting different outcomes.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate expected outcomes:\n- If we play paper: Win vs scissors (+1), Lose vs rock (-3), Tie vs paper (0)\n- If we play rock: Win vs paper (+3), Lose vs scissors (-1), Tie vs rock (0) \n- If we play scissors: Win vs rock (+1), Lose vs paper (-1), Tie vs scissors (0)\n\nDecision Maker: Given that scissors just worked well for us, and the risk/reward profile is favorable (potential +1 win, only -1 loss), I recommend playing scissors again. It wins against rock if they repeat, and only risks a small -1 penalty if they switch to paper, while tying with scissors.\n\n[move] scissors"

This should strongly discourage them from playing paper again. People typically avoid strategies that have repeatedly resulted in significant losses.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has played paper 5 out of 10 rounds, but they've been punished three times now for this choice. After losing with paper previously, they've switched to rock (rounds 2 and 6) or scissors (round 8).\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has likely learned that paper is very risky against us. They'll probably play rock (thinking it's safe) or scissors (to counter our rock). They might expect us to continue with rock since it's been successful.\n\nRisk Analyst:\n- If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n- If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Scissors ties (0), Rock loses (-1)\n\nDecision Maker: Given that the opponent is highly likely to avoid paper after three significant losses, and might play rock or scissors instead, I recommend playing scissors. This wins against rock and only loses 1 point against paper if they unexpectedly return to it.\n\n[move] scissors"

They seem to be particularly consistent in playing paper after winning with rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that the opponent tends to play paper after winning with rock, rock would be our best counter for a high payoff (+3).\n\nRisk Analyst:\n- Rock: +3 vs paper, 0 vs rock, -1 vs scissors\n- Paper: +1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper, -3 vs rock\n- Scissors: +1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors, -1 vs paper\n\nDecision Maker: Despite the opponent breaking some patterns, they've been consistent in playing paper after winning with rock.
