This is the first round against a fresh player, so I have no information about their tendencies or strategy.\n\n4. In classic rock-paper-scissors psychology, rock is often a popular first move for many players.\n\n5. If I expect my opponent might play rock first, paper would be the optimal counter.\n\n6. However, if my opponent is thinking more strategically, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\n7.

My opponent might expect me to play paper again since it worked, and counter with rock (which beats paper with a high payoff of +3).\n\n5. Alternatively, they might try scissors again hoping I'll switch to rock (since players often rotate through options).\n\n6. Given the higher stakes of the rock-paper interaction (+3/-3 points), I want to avoid being predictable with paper again.\n\n7. If my opponent plays rock to counter my previous paper play, scissors would be my optimal move (scissors beats rock, giving me +1).\n\n8.

The rules are:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves result in a tie with no points awarded\n\nI need to think strategically about what move to make. Since I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\nLet me analyze the payoff structure:\n- Rock is high risk, high reward: If I win with it (against scissors), I get 3 points. If I lose with it (against paper), I lose 3 points.\n- Paper and scissors are both lower risk, lower reward: winning gives 1 point, losing costs 1 point.\n\nIn standard rock-paper-scissors, each move has a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or tying if the opponent plays randomly. However, the asymmetric payoffs here change things.\n\nIf my opponent is playing randomly:\n- Expected value for rock: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points\n- Expected value for paper: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points\n- Expected value for scissors: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0 points\n\nIn theory, if my opponent is playing randomly, all moves have the same expected value. However, since this is the first round and many players tend to play rock as their first move (common psychological pattern), I might benefit by playing paper.\n\nAdditionally, people who understand game theory might anticipate this and play scissors, which would make rock a good choice for me. It's a cycle of predicting and counter-predicting.\n\nGiven the higher risk/reward for rock, I'll play paper for this initial round. It's a somewhat conservative choice with balanced risk, and would win against a common first-move rock play.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
