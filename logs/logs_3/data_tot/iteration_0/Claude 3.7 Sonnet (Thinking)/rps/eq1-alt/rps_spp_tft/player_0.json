    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes your strategy unpredictable and prevents exploitation.\n\nPsychology Expert: With a new player, there's no history to analyze for patterns yet. However, studies show that in the first round of Rock-Paper-Scissors, people tend to choose Rock slightly more often than the other options. Rock is perceived as \"strong\" and is a common intuitive first choice.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we have no prior data on this player, we should start with a relatively safe strategy. Given the Psychology Expert's insight about Rock being a common first choice, playing Paper would be a reasonable counter. If we win, we can adapt our strategy based on how they respond to losing.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid approach. If they're a rational player, they might anticipate us expecting Rock and play Paper instead, in which case Scissors would be optimal. But without data, a slight bias toward Paper is reasonable while maintaining unpredictability for future rounds.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Also, if we do win with Paper against their Rock, be prepared for them to possibly switch to Scissors next round, as players often counter what just beat them.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I think Paper is a reasonable first move given the psychological tendency for new players to choose Rock initially.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

There are several possibilities:\n\n1. They might stick with Paper, thinking it was successful in avoiding a loss\n2. They might predict we'll play Paper again and choose Scissors to beat us\n3. They might try to be unpredictable and choose Rock\n\nGame Theorist: From a game theory perspective, after a tie, players often shift to what would have beaten their previous move. In this case, they might choose Scissors to counter their own previous Paper play. If we expect them to play Scissors, we should play Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Agreed. Many players follow the pattern of \"if there was a tie, switch to what would beat your previous move.\" This is a common psychological pattern. They played Paper, so they might switch to Scissors next.\n\nStrategic Planner: Another factor to consider is that since they matched our Paper move in the first round, they might think we're likely to switch to Scissors, and therefore they might choose Rock to counter that.\n\nGame Theorist: True, it becomes a question of how many levels of reasoning we think they're employing. If they're using one level (\"they'll stay with Paper, so I'll use Scissors\"), we should use Rock. If they're using two levels (\"they'll expect me to use Scissors, so they'll use Rock\"), we should use Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Most casual players tend to use just one level of reasoning, especially in early rounds. They're more likely to think \"Paper tied, so I'll try Scissors now\" than to go through multiple levels of anticipation.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on this analysis, I think Rock is the most strategic move for this round.

This could suggest several things: either the opponent is thinking along similar lines as us, or there might be some mirroring strategy at play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive ties, there's a strong psychological tendency to break the pattern. The opponent might be frustrated with the ties and more likely to make a decisive change. Given that we just both played Rock, many players would switch to Paper now, trying to win rather than tie again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that breaking the pattern is likely. From the sequence so far (Paper\u2192Rock), the natural continuation would be Scissors, following the cycle of the game. Many players unconsciously follow this cycling pattern. If they do play Paper as the Psychology Expert suggests, Scissors would be our optimal response.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the possible opponent moves:\n1. If they play Paper (to beat our previous Rock) - Scissors would win for us\n2. If they play Scissors (continuing the Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors cycle) - Rock would win for us\n3. If they play Rock again - we'd tie again\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they matched our move twice could also indicate they might be mirroring our moves deliberately. If that's the case, whatever we play, they'll play the same and we'll tie again. However, this is less likely than them trying to break the tie streak.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the pattern so far and common RPS psychology, Scissors appears to be our best move. It counters the most likely opponent move (Paper) and breaks the pattern of our own play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the reasoning. After two ties and our last move being Rock, the opponent is most likely to play Paper next, making Scissors our optimal move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This strongly suggests the opponent might be implementing a mirroring strategy, matching whatever we play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, three identical moves in a row is unlikely to be coincidence. There are two main possibilities:\n1. The opponent is deliberately mirroring our moves\n2. By strange coincidence, they're following the same logical pattern we are\n\nGame Theorist: If they are mirroring us, then no matter what we play, we'll end up with another tie. However, we need to test this theory. The standard progression would be Paper\u2192Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper, so they might expect us to play Paper next. \n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze our options carefully:\n1. If they're truly mirroring us, any move results in a tie\n2. If they're anticipating our next move in the cycle (Paper), they might play Scissors to beat us\n3. If they're trying to break the pattern completely, they might choose randomly\n\nPsychology Expert: Another possibility is that they're using a \"one step ahead\" strategy - trying to predict and counter our next move. If they think we'll play Paper (continuing the cycle), they'd play Scissors. In that case, we should play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I think Rock is our best move here.

Therefore, Scissors would be our best response. If they're using a more complex strategy like \"play what would beat what I just played,\" they would play Scissors, in which case Rock would be optimal for us.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological principle of \"win-stay, lose-shift\" is very common in these games.

This is a fascinating pattern that suggests the opponent might primarily be mirroring our moves with occasional strategic deviations.\n\nPsychology Expert: The return to mirroring is significant. It could mean several things:\n1. The opponent's primary strategy might be mirroring\n2. They might be establishing a pattern of mostly ties with occasional attacks\n3. They could be using a more complex pattern we haven't fully identified yet\n\nGame Theorist: If they're primarily mirroring, then any move we make will likely result in a tie. However, if they're planning another deviation, we need to anticipate it. Given that they just played Scissors, if they follow typical RPS patterns, they might play Rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the concept of \"pattern recognition threshold\" - after a certain number of repetitions, people tend to expect a change. Having returned to mirroring once, they might be more likely to deviate again now, thinking we won't expect two deviations so close together.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue mirroring, any move results in a tie. If they anticipate we'll play Rock (to beat their previous Scissors), they might play Paper. If they're trying to win directly against our previous Scissors, they would play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Paper seems like a strategically sound move here. If they mirror, we tie.

The mirroring strategy seems dominant, with just one deviation so far. If they maintain this pattern, there's a high probability they'll mirror our next move again, resulting in another tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, we need to consider that as the game progresses, the opponent might grow tired of ties and make more deliberate attempts to win. After a long series of ties, there's often an increased psychological pressure to break the pattern.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they continue mirroring, any move results in a tie. If they attempt to beat what they think we'll play next (likely Scissors to counter Paper), they would play Rock.

The opponent is predominantly using a mirroring strategy with rare deviations.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's now beyond coincidental - this is almost certainly deliberate mirroring. However, the single deviation in round 4 suggests they occasionally break the pattern to try to win. Psychologically, after a long series of ties, the pressure to break the pattern increases.\n\nGame Theorist: We've now had 3 consecutive ties again (rounds 5-7), which is the same pattern we saw before their previous deviation in round 4. This might suggest they're ready to make another deviation.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they maintain perfect mirroring, no move has an advantage. But if they're going to make another strategic deviation, we should try to anticipate it. If they follow the same pattern as before, they might counter our next move instead of mirroring it.\n\nGame Theorist: The natural progression from Rock would be Paper.

Their strategy seems quite clear.\n\nPsychology Expert: With such consistent mirroring and only one deviation in round 4, we're dealing with a very disciplined opponent. The psychological question becomes: when will they choose to deviate again? After their previous three-tie sequence, they deviated. We've now had another three-tie sequence. This pattern similarity might indicate they're considering another deviation.\n\nGame Theorist: If they maintain perfect mirroring, any move results in a tie. The challenge is predicting when and how they'll make their next deviation. Their only deviation so far was playing Paper when we played Rock, which suggests they might occasionally try to counter our move rather than mirror it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Scissors, the natural progression in RPS would be to play Rock next. If they anticipate this and try to counter, they would play Paper. However, if we play Paper instead, we'd either tie (if they mirror) or win (if they play Rock trying to beat our previous Scissors).\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the principle of \"maximum unpredictability\" - after establishing a strong pattern, the most disruptive move is often to repeat the previous move rather than change. Since we just played Scissors, playing Scissors again might be unexpected.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their strong preference for mirroring, Paper seems like the safest move with upside potential:\n1. If they mirror, we tie (most likely)\n2. If they try to counter what they think we'll play (Rock after Scissors), they play Paper and we tie\n3.

The mirroring pattern is extraordinarily consistent.\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, the probability of continued mirroring is extremely high. However, given that their only deviation came after 3 consecutive ties, and we've now had 5 consecutive ties, they might be due for another strategic deviation.\n\nPsychology Expert: Long sequences of predictable outcomes often create psychological pressure to break the pattern. Having established such a strong mirroring pattern, they may be waiting for an optimal moment to deviate again for maximum impact.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Paper, they might expect us to play Scissors next (following the standard RPS progression). If they anticipate this and deviate from mirroring, they would play Rock to beat our expected Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: This creates an interesting opportunity. If we play Rock instead:\n1. If they mirror, we tie (still most likely)\n2. If they anticipate Scissors and play Rock to counter, we tie\n3. If they try to beat our previous Paper with Scissors, our Rock wins\n\nPsychology Expert: The principle of \"maximum unpredictability\" would suggest possibly repeating Paper, but that seems less optimal than Rock given the analysis.\n\nStrategic Planner: Rock provides the best combination of safety and winning potential in this situation. It protects against their potential deviation while giving us a win opportunity if they try to directly counter our previous move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing our extensive history of ties and the opponent's mirroring pattern, I'll play Rock this round.

However, the longer a pattern persists, the more likely a deviation becomes, especially after they've seen success with deviation before.\n\nPsychology Expert: We're now at 6 consecutive ties, which is twice as long as the sequence before their previous deviation. The psychological pressure to break this pattern must be building. This might be a high-probability round for them to attempt another deviation.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Rock, the natural progression would be to play Paper next.

The mirroring pattern is extremely consistent.\n\nGame Theorist: With over 90% mirroring and 7 consecutive ties, we're facing an opponent with remarkable commitment to their mirroring strategy. At this point, we have to accept that ties are the most likely outcome regardless of what we play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Such consistent mirroring for 7 rounds straight suggests they may be trying to establish an extremely predictable pattern before making their next strategic deviation. The psychological tension builds with each additional tie, increasing the potential for a pattern break.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Scissors, the traditional progression would be to play Rock.

If they try to beat our previous Scissors with Rock: Paper-Rock (we win)\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Paper also maintains unpredictability since we haven't repeated any particular sequence pattern. The opponent has now seen us play all possible transitions (Paper\u2192Rock, Rock\u2192Scissors, Scissors\u2192Paper, etc.), so we remain strategically flexible.\n\nStrategic Planner: Paper also protects us against their most likely deviation scenario while giving us a win opportunity if they attempt to directly counter our previous move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing our extensive history of ties and the opponent's extraordinarily consistent mirroring pattern, I'll play Paper this round.

However, this also means the tension for a pattern break is building. Their only deviation so far came after 3 consecutive ties, and we've now had 8 consecutive ties.\n\nPsychology Expert: The extended sequence of mirrors suggests two possibilities: either the opponent is committed to a pure mirroring strategy with rare deviations, or they're establishing an extremely predictable pattern before making a significant strategic move. The longer this continues, the more impactful a deviation would be.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Paper, the standard progression would be to play Scissors.

At this point, they've demonstrated such commitment to mirroring that it seems to be their fundamental strategy rather than a setup for a deviation.

The mirroring pattern is now at approximately 94.4%.\n\nGame Theorist: With 14 consecutive mirror moves, this is almost certainly a deliberate mirroring strategy. The opponent appears committed to mirroring with rare exceptions. Their only deviation occurred in round 4 and resulted in a win for them.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fourteen consecutive ties demonstrates extraordinary commitment to their strategy. At this point, we can be extremely confident that mirroring is their fundamental approach, though we should remain alert to the possibility of rare strategic deviations.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Paper, the standard progression would be to play Scissors next. If they anticipate this and try to counter, they would play Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze our options:\n1. If we play Rock:\n   - If they mirror (most likely): Rock-Rock (tie)\n   - If they expect Scissors and counter with Rock: Rock-Rock (tie)\n   - If they try to beat our Paper with Scissors: Rock-Scissors (we win)\n\n2. If we play Scissors:\n   - If they mirror (most likely): Scissors-Scissors (tie)\n   - If they counter our expected Scissors with Rock: Scissors-Rock (we lose)\n\n3. If we play Paper again:\n   - If they mirror (most likely): Paper-Paper (tie)\n   - If they expect Scissors and counter with Rock: Paper-Rock (we lose)\n\nPsychology Expert: Rock offers the best strategic position here. It protects against multiple potential opponent strategies while giving us a winning opportunity if they try to counter our previous Paper move.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After analyzing the opponent's extraordinary commitment to mirroring (17/18 rounds with 14 consecutive ties), I'll play Rock this round. It provides the best combination of safety and winning potential against the range of possible opponent strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

The opponent appears firmly committed to mirroring with very rare exceptions.\n\nPsychology Expert: Fifteen consecutive ties demonstrates remarkable consistency. It's important to note that their only deviation came in round 4, which resulted in a win for them. If they do have a more complex strategy beyond pure mirroring, they're extremely patient in its execution.\n\nStrategic Planner: Since we just played Rock, the standard progression would be to play Paper next.
