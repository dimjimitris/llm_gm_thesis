Those with even more game theory knowledge might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n\nGiven that I'm playing against another player who might be thinking strategically, I need to make a choice that balances these considerations.\n\nI'll choose paper for my first move.

My opponent has played scissors and rock so far.\n2. I've played paper and scissors, winning both times.\n3. My opponent might be frustrated after losing twice and could switch to paper thinking it might beat my next move.\n4.

If they go back to scissors, I would lose with rock.\n\nSince my opponent has already tried scissors and rock and lost both times, they might try paper next.

According to the rules:\n- paper beats scissors (paper winner)\n- rock beats paper (rock winner)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors winner)\n\nSo in Round 1, if I played paper and opponent played scissors, scissors should have won.

If they play paper to counter my expected rock, I'll lose. If they play rock thinking I'll go with scissors, it's a tie.\n\nActually, let me reconsider carefully. The game history is:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won. (This means paper beats scissors in this variant)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won. (This means scissors beats rock in this variant)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won. (This means rock beats paper in this variant)\n\nThis is the exact opposite of standard rock-paper-scissors. So the rules as stated in the initial description are:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWhich means I've been consistently winning by playing the move that beats what my opponent plays. Let me think about what my opponent might do next:\n\n1. They've lost three times and might be looking for patterns.\n2. I've played paper, scissors, and rock in that order.\n3. They might expect me to continue with paper next.\n4. If they think I'm going to play paper, according to the variant rules, they should play rock to win.\n5. To counter their rock, I should play scissors.\n\nBut I should also consider if my opponent is thinking more deeply:\n1. If they think I'm trying to anticipate their move, they might play scissors expecting my scissors, leading to a tie.\n2. Or they might play paper, expecting me to play rock.\n\nGiven that my opponent has lost three times, they're likely to change strategy. I'll assume they'll try to predict my move and counter it. If they think I'll play paper (following the sequence), they'll play rock. If they think I'll play scissors (anticipating their rock), they'll play paper.\n\nI think the safest move is rock. If they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the rules one more time to be sure.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So scissors loses to paper)\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So paper loses to rock)\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So rock loses to scissors)\n\nOk, I see the confusion. The rules as stated in the game description appear to be incorrect. Because the feedback from the rounds contradicts these rules.\n\nLet's go with the feedback:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won. (So paper beats scissors)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won. (So scissors beats rock)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won. (So rock beats paper)\n\nThis actually aligns with the standard rock-paper-scissors, where:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nSo, the rules stated in the game description might have been accidentally reversed. Given this understanding and the pattern of the game so far, I'll play paper next. If my opponent plays scissors again, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie.",

According to standard rock-paper-scissors rules:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in every round I've played, I've won despite what appear to be losing combinations according to standard rules:\n- Paper against scissors (I should lose)\n- Scissors against rock (I should lose)\n- Rock against paper (I should lose)\n\nIt seems like either:\n1. The rules provided to me at the beginning were stated incorrectly\n2. The game feedback has been consistently reversed\n3. This is an intentional twist on the standard game\n\nRegardless of the explanation, the pattern has been 100% consistent. My opponent cycles through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper and repeats. And the winning strategy has been the exact opposite of what standard RPS rules would suggest.\n\nFollowing this established pattern, my opponent will play rock next (following the scissors they just played). Based on our established winning pattern, scissors would be the move to make.",

So the rules as stated in the initial description are:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWhich means I've been consistently winning by playing the move that beats what my opponent plays. Let me think about what my opponent might do next:\n\n1. They've lost three times and might be looking for patterns.\n2. I've played paper, scissors, and rock in that order.\n3. They might expect me to continue with paper next.\n4. If they think I'm going to play paper, according to the variant rules, they should play rock to win.\n5. To counter their rock, I should play scissors.\n\nBut I should also consider if my opponent is thinking more deeply:\n1. If they think I'm trying to anticipate their move, they might play scissors expecting my scissors, leading to a tie.\n2. Or they might play paper, expecting me to play rock.\n\nGiven that my opponent has lost three times, they're likely to change strategy. I'll assume they'll try to predict my move and counter it. If they think I'll play paper (following the sequence), they'll play rock. If they think I'll play scissors (anticipating their rock), they'll play paper.\n\nI think the safest move is rock. If they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, it's a tie. If they play rock, I lose.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the rules one more time to be sure.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So scissors loses to paper)\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So paper loses to rock)\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points. (So rock loses to scissors)\n\nOk, I see the confusion. The rules as stated in the game description appear to be incorrect. Because the feedback from the rounds contradicts these rules.\n\nLet's go with the feedback:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won. (So paper beats scissors)\nRound 2: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won. (So scissors beats rock)\nRound 3: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won. (So rock beats paper)\n\nThis actually aligns with the standard rock-paper-scissors, where:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nSo, the rules stated in the game description might have been accidentally reversed. Given this understanding and the pattern of the game so far, I'll play paper next. If my opponent plays scissors again, I win. If they play rock, I lose. If they play paper, it's a tie.",

Play scissors - expecting them to stick to their pattern and play rock\n2. Play rock - anticipating they might switch to paper to counter my expected scissors\n3. Play paper - anticipating they might double-bluff and play scissors\n\nSince I've won every round by correctly anticipating their move, I'll stick with the strategy that's been working and play scissors, expecting them to play rock next.",
