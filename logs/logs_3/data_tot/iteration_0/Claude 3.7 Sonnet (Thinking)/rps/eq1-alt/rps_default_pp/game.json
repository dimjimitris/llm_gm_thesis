The description said:\n- paper beats scissors (but in practice, it seems like paper beats scissors)\n- rock beats paper (but in practice, it seems like rock beats paper)\n- scissors beats rock (but in practice, it seems like scissors beats rock)\n\nSo I've adapted my strategy to follow these observed rules rather than the stated rules.\n\nAdditionally, my opponent seems to be following a predictable pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock... and so on.\n\nI've been countering with: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors... and this has been winning consistently for multiple rounds.\n\nI'll continue with this strategy, moving to rock next in my sequence.",

My winning pattern has been:\n- When I play paper, my opponent plays scissors, and I win\n- When I play scissors, my opponent plays rock, and I win\n- When I play rock, my opponent plays paper, and I win\n\n4. This is actually the opposite of the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules as stated in the game description. It appears that in this version:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock beats paper (this is standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not the other way around)\n\n5. I've been cycling through paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, and it's been working perfectly. My opponent seems to be following a predictable pattern.\n\nI'll continue with this strategy by choosing paper next, as it should beat my opponent's scissors if they continue their pattern.",

The game description is accurate.\n\nMy recent moves have been following a pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 etc., and I've been winning consistently.
