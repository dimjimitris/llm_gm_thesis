He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me review:\n- \"paper beats scissors\" - this would mean paper wins against scissors\n- \"rock beats paper\" - this means rock wins against paper\n- \"scissors beats rock\" - this means scissors wins against rock\n\nThis creates a circular relationship where paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock, and rock beats paper. This is the classic rock-paper-scissors game, but with the first relation inverted from the standard rules.\n\nActually, I think there might be a typo in the first rule. In standard rock-paper-scissors:\n- Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)\n- Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)\n- Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)\n\nSo I think the first rule should be \"paper beats rock\" rather than \"paper beats scissors.\"\n\nLet me strategize based on what I think are the correct rules (the standard rock-paper-scissors rules).\n\nIn a single round against a fresh player with no history, any move is equally likely to win, lose, or tie.

My opponent has now played paper twice in a row, after playing scissors. They might continue with paper, expecting me to play paper again (resulting in another tie), or they might anticipate me changing to rock (to beat paper) and thus switch to scissors.\n\nLet me count their overall strategy:\n- Scissors: 6 times (Rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11)\n- Rock: 3 times (Rounds 5, 6, 8)\n- Paper: 3 times (Rounds 7, 10, 12)\n\nThey've most frequently played scissors, but recently have played more paper. Given they've played paper twice in a row, I think they might:\n1. Continue with paper for a third time\n2. Switch to rock anticipating I might play scissors to counter their paper\n3. Switch to scissors anticipating I might play rock to counter their paper\n\nIf they continue with paper, scissors would be my best move.\nIf they switch to rock, paper would be my best move.\nIf they switch to scissors, rock would be my best move.\n\nGiven that scissors has been their most frequent historical move, and they might anticipate me playing rock (to beat their paper streak), I think they may switch to scissors. Therefore, I'll play rock to counter this potential scissors play.\n\nWait, I need to double-check the rules again. According to the game description:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nThese are the opposite of traditional rock-paper-scissors rules. So my analysis above needs to be adjusted:\n\nIf they continue with paper, rock would be my best move.\nIf they switch to rock, scissors would be my best move.\nIf they switch to scissors, paper would be my best move.\n\nGiven the history and potential for them to return to scissors (their most frequent play), I'll choose paper, which according to these rules, would beat scissors.",

Round 1-20 analysis shows we've now had two consecutive ties - first with paper, then with rock.\n3. My opponent's move distribution is now:\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times \n   - Rock: 6 times\n4. After ties, my opponent has played:\n   - Paper: 3 times\n   - Rock: 2 times\n   - Scissors: 1 time\n5. After consecutive ties, players typically make significant changes to break the pattern.\n6. Since they've played rock twice in a row, they're unlikely to play rock a third time.\n7. Based on their historical patterns, they favor paper after ties, making it their most likely next move.\n8. If they play paper, scissors would be my optimal counter according to this game's rules.\n9. Even if they switch to scissors instead, scissors would result in a tie rather than a loss.\n10. Given these factors, scissors seems like the strongest strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] scissors",

According to the pattern, my opponent often changes their strategy after losing. Looking at their behavior after losses, they don't seem to have a consistent pattern in terms of which specific move they choose next, but they do tend to change.\n\nSince they just lost with scissors, they're unlikely to play scissors again. Given their distribution of moves, they might switch to paper (their most frequent choice) or rock.\n\nIf they play paper, scissors would be my optimal counter according to this game's rules.\nIf they play rock, paper would be my optimal counter.\n\nSince paper has been their most frequent choice overall (9 times), and they've shown a tendency to return to their preferred moves, scissors seems like the most strategic choice to counter their potential paper play. Even if they choose rock instead, I can adjust my strategy in the following round.",
