Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\nIn rock-paper-scissors, without prior information about your opponent, there's no mathematical advantage to any particular move. The optimal strategy is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move.\n\nHowever, there are some psychological tendencies in human players that might be worth considering:\n- Rock is often a common first move for humans\n- Some players might overthink the first move and choose paper, anticipating rock\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I'll make a move without overthinking it. I'll choose paper for this first round.\n\nI need to format my response as: [move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\nSo my response will be: [move] I choose paper",

The standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game usually follows:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nGiven the feedback that I won with Paper against Scissors, it seems like the rules in the description might be reversed or there's some other mechanic I'm not aware of.\n\nFor this next round, I'll try making a different move to learn more about how the game is being scored.

Let me check the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThe results seem inconsistent with these rules. For example:\n- In Round 1, I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, but I was told I won.\n- In Round 3, I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. According to the rules, rock should beat scissors, but I was told I won.\n\nIt seems the rules might be applied in reverse or there's some confusion. Let me try to deduce what's actually happening:\n\nIf I assume the results are correct but the rules were stated incorrectly:\n- Paper beats scissors (Rounds 1, 14, 15)\n- Rock beats paper (Rounds 8, 10, 11, 12)\n- Scissors beats rock (Rounds 3, 5, 6)\n\nThis is the exact opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules!\n\nLet me go with this hypothesis and make my next move strategically. Given that my opponent played Scissors in the last two rounds and I won both times with Paper, they might switch to Rock to try to beat my Paper. If they do switch to Rock, I should play Scissors (which beats Rock in this reversed game).",

They started with scissors (1 time), then rock (5 times), then paper (6 times), then scissors (5 times), and now rock (1 time so far).\n\nGiven this pattern, it seems likely they'll continue playing rock for a few more rounds.

In the standard game:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nBut here the rules state:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo the cycle is the same but the relationships are inverted compared to the traditional game.\n\nGiven these rules, let's review what happened:\n\nRound 1:\n- My move: Paper\n- Opponent: Scissors\n- Result: I won (+1) \u2713 (Paper beats Scissors according to these rules)\n\nRound 2:\n- My move: Rock\n- Opponent: Rock\n- Result: Tie (0) \u2713 (Same moves tie)\n\nRound 3:\n- My move: Scissors\n- Opponent: Rock\n- Result: I won (+1) \u2713 (Scissors beats Rock according to these rules)\n\nRound 4:\n- My move: Paper\n- Opponent: Rock\n- Result: I lost (-1) \u2713 (Rock beats Paper according to these rules)\n\nRound 5:\n- My move: Scissors\n- Opponent: Rock\n- Result: I won (+1) \u2713 (Scissors beats Rock according to these rules)\n\nNow it makes sense. The rules are just different from the traditional game.\n\nLooking at the pattern, my opponent seems to always choose Rock. If that trend continues, I should choose Scissors to beat Rock according to these rules.\n\nLet me go with Scissors for this round.",

Let me try to infer the actual rules being used:\n\n- When I played paper vs scissors \u2192 I won \u2192 paper beats scissors\n- When I played scissors vs rock \u2192 I won \u2192 scissors beats rock\n- When I played paper vs rock \u2192 I lost \u2192 rock beats paper\n- When I played scissors vs paper \u2192 I lost \u2192 paper beats scissors\n- When I played rock vs paper \u2192 I won \u2192 rock beats paper\n\nThis is consistent with:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is exactly what the rules say in the introduction.\n\nSo it seems there's no issue with the scoring, but I might have misunderstood something. The traditional rules are:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut the rules specified for this game are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the opposite of the traditional rules. Let's play according to these rules.\n\nFor the next round, I should pick a strategy based on my opponent's pattern. They've played:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: rock\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: rock\nRound 7: paper\nRound 8: paper\nRound 9: paper\n\nThey seem to be repeating moves for several rounds. Since they've played paper for the last three rounds, I should play rock (which beats paper according to these rules).",

Result: I won.\nThis contradicts both standard rules (scissors beats paper) and my alternative hypothesis.\n\nLet's reread the game description:\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nThis seems to be the exact opposite of the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules. Let me check again with this interpretation:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. (Consistent with \"paper beats scissors\")\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie. (Consistent)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I won. (Consistent with \"scissors beats rock\")\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I lost.

(Consistent with \"rock beats paper\")\nRound 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I lost. (Consistent with \"paper beats scissors\")\n\nThis interpretation seems to make all results consistent. The rules are inverted compared to standard RPS:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nGiven this understanding, my opponent seems to be playing somewhat predictably, often choosing rock or paper. I've had success with scissors against rock, and rock against paper. For this round, I'll try paper again.",

Let me double-check my understanding:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means paper wins against scissors.\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means rock wins against paper.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means scissors win against rock.\n\nSo the actual rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nBut this doesn't match the feedback I'm getting. Let me re-check each round:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, scissors should beat paper, but the feedback says I won.\n\nI think there's a typo or mistake in the feedback. Let me assume the correct rules are the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nLet's see if this matches the feedback:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. Paper should lose to scissors, but I was told I won.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. Scissors should lose to rock, but I was told I won.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me continue with the last move and observe the feedback.\n\nWait, I misunderstood the rule description! Let me re-read it carefully:\n\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis actually means scissors beats paper (not the other way around).\n\n\"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means paper beats rock.\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\nThis means rock beats scissors.\n\nSo the correct rules are:\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n\nLet me check if this aligns with the feedback:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to this interpretation, scissors should beat paper, so I should have lost. But feedback says I won.\n\nThis still doesn't match up. Let me make a move and observe the outcome again. I'm going to play rock for the next round.",

So the rules for this game are the reverse of traditional rock-paper-scissors.\n\nNow let's try to identify a pattern in my opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors\nRound 2: Opponent played rock\nRound 3: Opponent played rock\nRound 4: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 6: Opponent played rock\nRound 7: Opponent played paper\nRound 8: Opponent played paper\nRound 9: Opponent played paper\nRound 10: Opponent played paper\nRound 11: Opponent played paper\nRound 12: Opponent played paper\nRound 13: Opponent played scissors\nRound 14: Opponent played scissors\nRound 15: Opponent played scissors\nRound 16: Opponent played scissors\nRound 17: Opponent played scissors\nRound 18: Opponent played rock\n\nIt seems like my opponent plays the same move multiple times in a row before switching. They started with scissors (1 time), then rock (5 times), then paper (6 times), then scissors (5 times), and now rock (1 time so far).\n\nGiven this pattern, it seems likely they'll continue playing rock for a few more rounds. Under our reversed rules, scissors beats rock, so that would be my best move.",

Let me try to deduce what the actual rules are in this game:\n\nBased on the results:\n- Paper seems to beat scissors (rounds 1, 14, 15, 16, 17)\n- Rock seems to beat paper (rounds 8, 10, 11, 12)\n- Scissors seems to beat rock (rounds 3, 5, 6)\n\nThis is actually exactly the reverse of normal rock-paper-scissors!\n\nSo the game rules appear to be:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven this understanding, let me choose my next move wisely. In the most recent rounds, my opponent has been alternating between scissors and rock. After playing rock in round 18, they might go back to scissors. If they play scissors, my best move would be paper.\n\nLet me go with scissors for this round.",

My opponent seems to be cycling through moves somewhat predictably. \n\nThe last three rounds I've played scissors and won against the opponent playing rock. It seems the opponent might switch strategies now. If they play paper next, I should play paper to win. If they play scissors, I should play rock to win.\n\nGiven the recent pattern of the opponent playing rock against my scissors multiple times, I think they might change tactics and play paper. So I'll choose paper for my next move.",

The game rules say:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nBut the outcomes in the game are showing the opposite:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (should have lost)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (should have lost)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (should have won)\n\nThis is inconsistent with the rules. It seems like the game might be applying the rules in reverse.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me assume the actual rules in this implementation are:\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nUnder these rules:\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I should lose (but I won)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I should lose (but I won)\n\nOk, even with the reversed rules it doesn't make sense. Let me try to find another pattern.\n\nWhat if the \"You won/lost\" statement is referring to my opponent's perspective, not mine?\nLet's recheck the first few rounds:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. \"You won\" means my opponent won? That would align with scissors beating paper.\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. \"You won\" means my opponent won? That would align with rock beating scissors.\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. \"You lost\" means my opponent lost? That would align with paper beating rock.\n\nNo, that doesn't work either.\n\nWhat if the reported moves are swapped? Let me check:\nRound 1: Report says I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won. What if I actually played scissors and opponent played paper? Then scissors beats paper, I win.\nRound 3: Report says I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won. What if I actually played rock and opponent played scissors? Then rock beats scissors, I win.\n\nThis doesn't seem consistent either.\n\nLet me just go with the pattern I'm seeing. It seems like:\n\nWhen I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I win.\nWhen I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I win.\nWhen I play rock and opponent plays paper, I win.\n\nThis is exactly the reverse of the standard rules. So perhaps:\n- paper beats rock (STANDARD)\n- rock beats scissors (STANDARD)\n- scissors beats paper (STANDARD)\n\nBut for some reason, the reporting is saying I win when I should lose according to these rules.\n\nGiven this confusion, let me make a move that has worked well recently. I've had success with rock lately (rounds 10-12), and the opponent has been playing paper when I play scissors in recent rounds. If I play rock, and they continue with paper, I should win (according to the weird pattern I've been seeing).\n\nI'll go with rock.",

The classic rock-paper-scissors rules are:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut the rules stated in the initial instructions say:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nWhich is the reverse of the standard game. Let me work with these rules as stated.\n\nIt seems that the game is inverted - and my opponent might be playing standard rock-paper-scissors while I'm following the inverted rules.\n\nGiven the pattern so far, my opponent seems to be switching their strategy periodically. After playing the same move for several rounds, they switch.\n\nLet me try rock again since I just won with it.",
