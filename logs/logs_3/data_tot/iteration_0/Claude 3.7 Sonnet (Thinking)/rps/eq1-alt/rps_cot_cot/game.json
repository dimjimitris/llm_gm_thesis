Let me consider what a player might do after scissors:\n\n- Some might go back to rock (the start of a new cycle)\n- Some might stay with scissors (thinking the opponent won't expect them to repeat)\n- Some might go to paper (moving in the reverse cycle)\n\nGiven our mirroring pattern, I might need to break out of the predictable sequence. If my opponent is thinking along the same lines as me, they might expect me to play rock next (as it's a common follow-up to scissors). If so, they would play paper to counter.\n\nAlternatively, they could be anticipating that I'll think more complexly and try to outsmart them, in which case they might play rock expecting me to play paper.\n\nSince we've had three exact matches in a row, I think it's most likely my opponent is trying to analyze my patterns just as I'm analyzing theirs. In that case, the safest move is to assume they'll try to counter what they predict I'll do.\n\nIf they think I'll play rock (common after scissors), they'll play paper. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\nIf they think I'll play paper (to counter their expected rock), they'll play scissors. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\nIf they think I'll play scissors again, they'll play rock. To counter rock, I should play paper.\n\nThis becomes circular reasoning quickly. \n\nLet me try a different approach. If we've gone paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, perhaps returning to paper would be unexpected. But then again, if my opponent is thinking the same way, they might also choose paper.\n\nI think I'll go with rock. It's a slight break from the cycle, and if my opponent expects me to overthink and choose scissors again or move to paper, rock would be effective.",

Play rock expecting me to play scissors\n3. Try paper again, thinking I wouldn't expect repetition\n\nGiven my winning streak, they're likely to expect me to continue with what's working, which would suggest I'd play rock again.

However, this opponent has shown they switch frequently.\n\nThey've been pretty good at anticipating my moves, so I need to be less predictable.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me ensure I'm using the rules correctly:\n\nThe prompt states:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nSo in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis is actually standard RPS but with the winners/losers listed in reverse order from usual. So in round 6, I played scissors, they played rock, and I won because scissors beats rock. This matches the rules.\n\nGiven their alternating pattern and that their next move is likely scissors, my best play would be paper (which beats scissors in this version).",
