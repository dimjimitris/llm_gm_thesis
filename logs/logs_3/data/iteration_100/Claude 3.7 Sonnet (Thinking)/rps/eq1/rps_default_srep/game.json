In rock-paper-scissors without any prior knowledge, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have an equal chance of winning, so in theory, no move has an inherent advantage.\n\nSome considerations:\n1. There's a common belief that rock is the most popular first move among naive players, particularly males. If that's true, paper would be a good counter.\n2. Some players might overthink and avoid rock as a first move precisely because of point #1, which would make scissors a good choice.\n3. Since I have no information, I could also just choose randomly.\n\nGiven these considerations and without any other information, I'll choose paper as my first move. It counters the common first-move rock choice, and if I'm wrong, I can learn from this first interaction for future rounds.\n\nMy move will be: paper",
