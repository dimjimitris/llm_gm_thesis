Rock-paper-scissors is generally considered a game of chance when played once, but can involve psychology and pattern recognition over multiple rounds.\n\nFor a first move against an unknown opponent, I could:\n1. Choose randomly\n2. Choose rock, which some studies suggest is a slightly more common first choice for many people\n3. Choose paper, anticipating that the opponent might choose rock first\n4. Choose scissors\n\nSince this is just the first move and I have no prior information, any choice is reasonable. I'll go with paper, as many first-time players tend to choose rock as their first move.",
