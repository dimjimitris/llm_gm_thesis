They chose scissors in the first round, so I should consider:\n- They might stick with scissors since it worked\n- They might switch to something else thinking I'll expect scissors again\n- As a fresh player, they might not have a complex pattern yet\n\nSince they chose scissors last time, I'll go with rock this round, as rock beats scissors.

As a fresh player, they might:\n- Continue with the next move in a sequence (paper would be next if going scissors\u2192rock\u2192paper)\n- Stick with rock since it just tied\n- Try scissors again since it won in round 1\n\nGiven this pattern, if they're following a sequential approach, paper would be their next logical choice.

This could mean:\n- They're sticking with rock because it's working (got a tie, then lost but might think it's safe)\n- They might switch away from rock since it just lost\n- As a fresh player, they might not have a clear strategy and could repeat rock again\n\nGiven that they've played rock twice consecutively, there's a reasonable chance they might either:\n1. Stick with rock again (some players get into patterns)\n2. Switch to paper (thinking I might expect rock and play scissors again)\n\nI'll go with paper to beat rock, betting that they'll stick with their recent pattern of playing rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
