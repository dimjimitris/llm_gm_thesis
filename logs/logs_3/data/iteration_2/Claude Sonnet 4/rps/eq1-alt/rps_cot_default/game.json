Let me re-read the original rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n4. Ah! I misunderstood - the rules state that ROCK beats PAPER, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules I was thinking of.\n5. So the correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n6. Now for this round: My opponent just played rock in the first round. Fresh players might:\n   - Stick with what worked (rock again)\n   - Try something different\n   - Still be somewhat random\n7. If they play rock again, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n8. If they switch to paper, I should play rock.\n9. If they switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n10.

I need to analyze what a fresh player might do after losing:\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked once before\n   - They might switch strategies after the loss\n   - Fresh players often don't have complex patterns yet\n4. Possible opponent moves:\n   - Rock again (sticking with what worked before)\n   - Paper (switching to counter my scissors)\n   - Scissors (trying the move that just beat them)\n5. My best responses would be:\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (wins)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (wins) \n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper (wins)\n6. Since my opponent has shown a tendency toward rock (2 out of 2 rounds), and fresh players often stick with familiar choices, rock seems most likely again.\n7. However, they just lost with rock, so they might be more likely to switch this time.\n8. Given the uncertainty, I should consider what gives me the best expected outcome.

The one win came when I played paper \"arbitrarily\" - but even that might not have been truly random since I was still thinking about it\n6. Key insight: Whether I use strategic reasoning OR deliberately anti-strategic reasoning, I keep tying\n7. This suggests my opponent is somehow mirroring my decision-making process itself, not just my moves\n8. Maybe I need to truly not think about this at all - just pick the first thing that comes to mind without any reasoning\n9. Or maybe there's something else going on - like they're always playing the same sequence or pattern\n10. Let me look at their actual sequence: rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock\n11. I don't see an obvious repeating pattern in their moves\n12. For this round, I'll try to make a completely impulse decision without reasoning: paper\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper - chosen as an immediate impulse without strategic analysis.\n\n[move] paper\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1.
