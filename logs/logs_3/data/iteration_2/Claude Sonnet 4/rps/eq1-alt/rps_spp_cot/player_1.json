    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "I need to think through this step-by-step to maximize my points in this rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Analyze the game structure**: This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game where:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. **Consider my opponent**: The hint mentions I'm playing against a \"fresh player.\" This could mean:\n   - They're new to the game and might not have a developed strategy\n   - They might make predictable or random choices\n   - Fresh players often default to common first moves\n\n3. **Analyze common first-move tendencies**: In rock-paper-scissors, many players (especially beginners) tend to:\n   - Choose rock first (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Choose scissors less frequently as a first move\n   - Paper is moderately common\n\n4. **Develop my strategy**: Since rock is statistically the most common first move among new players, I should choose paper to counter it. This gives me the best chance of winning (+1 point) rather than tying (0 points) or losing (-1 point).\n\n5. **Make my decision**: Paper beats rock, so if my opponent follows the common pattern of choosing rock first, I'll win this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the most likely first move (rock) from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper - countering the most common first move among new players\n"

This tells me:\n   - My opponent also chose paper, not the expected rock\n   - They might be thinking strategically too\n   - They could have been trying to counter rock as well, or had a different reasoning\n\n2. **Update my assessment of the opponent**: Since they chose paper (not the typical beginner's rock), they might:\n   - Be more strategic than initially expected\n   - Have been thinking about common patterns too\n   - Potentially be trying to counter what they thought I would do\n\n3. **Consider second-round psychology**: After a tie, players often:\n   - Switch to a different move to avoid another tie\n   - Try to counter what they think the opponent will do next\n   - Sometimes stick with the same move if they think it was \"safe\"\n\n4. **Analyze likely opponent moves**: Given they played paper last round, they might:\n   - Switch to rock or scissors to avoid another tie\n   - Think I'll switch from paper, so they might play scissors to beat my potential rock\n   - Or play rock thinking I'll stick with paper\n\n5. **Develop my counter-strategy**: If my opponent is likely to switch from paper, they have two options:\n   - If they choose rock \u2192 I should choose paper (but that's what I just played)\n   - If they choose scissors \u2192 I should choose rock\n   \n   Since they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they might anticipate I'll change moves and choose scissors to beat rock. Therefore, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, expecting my opponent to switch to scissors after our paper tie.\n\n[move] Rock - anticipating opponent will switch to scissors after the tie\n"
