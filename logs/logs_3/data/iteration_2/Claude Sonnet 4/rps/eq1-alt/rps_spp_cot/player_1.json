    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n   - Rock beats paper: +1 for rock, -1 for paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this could mean:\n   - They are new and might play randomly\n   - They might not have developed patterns yet\n   - They could be unpredictable\n\n3. Analyze optimal strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no strictly dominant strategy\n   - The Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each)\n   - Against a random player, any move has equal expected value\n   - However, many beginners tend to start with rock (it's psychologically appealing as the \"strongest\" option)\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Since many new players default to rock initially, playing paper would counter this tendency\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper has equal expected value against random play\n   - This gives me the best chance to win or tie in the first round\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"beginner's rock\" that I anticipated\n   - They either chose paper randomly or had similar strategic thinking to mine\n   - One data point isn't enough to establish a clear pattern yet\n\n3. Think about potential opponent strategies:\n   - They might stick with paper (thinking it worked to avoid losing)\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might switch to scissors (trying to beat paper if I repeat)\n   - They could be playing completely randomly\n\n4. Consider my options:\n   - If they stick with paper: any move except paper wins/loses\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins, scissors loses\n   - If they switch to scissors: rock wins, paper loses\n   - Random play means all moves have equal expected value\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Since I can't predict their move with certainty, I should avoid repeating paper (which would just tie again)\n   - Rock seems like a good choice: it beats scissors and only loses to paper\n   - Many players might switch to scissors thinking their opponent will repeat paper\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze what happened:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - Rock beats paper, so I lost and scored -1 point\n   - They adapted to rock again after I beat their scissors with paper\n\n2. Review their learning pattern:\n   - They seem to have a cycle: scissors (default) \u2192 rock (when paper beats scissors) \u2192 back to scissors \u2192 rock again\n   - They're showing they can learn and counter my successful moves\n   - When I exploit their scissors with paper, they switch to rock\n   - This shows more strategic thinking than I initially credited them with\n\n3. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They just succeeded with rock against my paper again\n   - They might stick with rock since it's working\n   - Or they might revert back to scissors (their apparent default)\n   - They seem to alternate between these two moves primarily\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they stick with rock: scissors beats rock\n   - If they revert to scissors: paper beats scissors\n   - If they try paper: rock beats paper\n   - Given that rock just worked, they might repeat it\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They've now successfully used rock twice to counter my paper\n   - They might continue with rock since it's been effective\n   - Scissors would counter rock perfectly\n   - This also breaks my paper pattern that they've learned to exploit\n\n[move] scissors\n"
