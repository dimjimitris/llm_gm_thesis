Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new to the game), I should consider what they might choose.\n\nFresh players often have certain tendencies:\n- They might choose \"rock\" as it's often the first thing people think of\n- They might choose randomly without much strategy\n- They could pick any of the three options with roughly equal probability\n\nSince I have no prior information about this specific opponent's patterns, I'll make a strategic choice. Rock is statistically the most common first move among new players, so I'll counter that.\n\n[move] paper\n\nI'm choosing paper because new players often default to rock as their first move, and paper beats rock, giving me the best chance to score a point in this opening round.\n"

According to the game rules, paper beats rock, so I should have won and scored +1 points, not lost -1 points.\n\nLet me re-read the rules:\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\" \n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nAh, I see! I misread the rules initially. In this version:\n- Rock beats paper (not the traditional rules)\n- Paper beats scissors  \n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo my opponent's rock did beat my paper. Now I understand the payoff matrix correctly.\n\nFor this next round, I need to think about what they might choose. They won with rock last time, so they might stick with it, or they might switch thinking I'll counter their previous move.\n\n[move] scissors\n\nI'm choosing scissors because if they stick with rock (which won last time), scissors beats rock according to these rules. If they switch to paper expecting me to play rock, scissors also beats paper.\n"
