    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\":\n   - This suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet\n   - Fresh players often have predictable patterns or biases\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\")\n\n3. Develop an opening strategy:\n   - Since many new players choose rock as their first move, paper would counter this effectively\n   - Paper is also a good psychological choice as it's less obvious than rock\n   - If they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - Paper seems like the optimal first move against a fresh player\n   - It counters the most common beginner choice (rock)\n   - It positions me well for future rounds by establishing unpredictability\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Look at my successful rounds:\n   - Round 4: My paper beat their scissors\n   - Round 5: My rock beat their paper  \n   - Round 9: My paper beat their scissors\n   - I've won by correctly predicting scissors (twice) and paper (once)\n\n5. Analyze current situation:\n   - We just both chose rock\n   - The opponent has shown they adapt after losses\n   - They might expect me to switch after the tie\n   - Or they might try to anticipate my next strategic move\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent chose rock after losing with scissors in round 9\n   - After this rock tie, they might cycle to paper or scissors\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock (since ties don't hurt), they might choose scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might choose paper or rock\n   - Given their history of using scissors frequently when under pressure, scissors seems likely\n\n7.

Identify the synchronization issue:\n   - We're thinking too similarly - both following logical strategic patterns\n   - Recent ties: rock \u2192 paper, suggesting we're both cycling or using similar logic\n   - The opponent seems to be mirroring my strategic thinking process\n\n4. Analyze opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Rounds 9-11: scissors, rock, paper\n   - This looks like they might be cycling through all three moves\n   - If continuing this pattern, they might choose scissors next\n\n5. Consider anti-synchronization tactics:\n   - I need to think about what my \"logical\" choice would be, then potentially choose differently\n   - After a paper tie, my instinct might be to choose rock or scissors\n   - But if they have the same instinct, that leads to more ties\n   - I should focus on what beats their most likely next move\n\n6. Pattern prediction:\n   - If they're cycling (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), they'll choose scissors\n   - If they're adapting to avoid ties, they might choose rock (expecting me to choose scissors)\n   - Scissors has been their most frequent choice when under pressure or after losses\n\n7.

Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose rock (continuing their rigid cycle), I should choose scissors\n   - Scissors would give me an eighth consecutive win\n   - Given their absolute mechanical consistency through 7 losses, they'll almost certainly continue\n   - I should capitalize on this unprecedented predictability\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
