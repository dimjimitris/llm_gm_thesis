    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This means my opponent also thought strategically or had similar reasoning.\n\n2. **Update opponent assessment**: This \"fresh player\" chose paper as well, suggesting they either:\n   - Had similar strategic thinking (expecting rock and countering with paper)\n   - Are more experienced than initially indicated\n   - Made a lucky guess\n\n3. **Consider psychological factors**: After a tie with paper, players often:\n   - Switch to rock (thinking the opponent will stick with paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (thinking the opponent will switch to rock)\n   - Stick with paper (if they think it was a good choice)\n\n4. **Analyze the meta-game**: Since we both chose paper, there's a chance my opponent will now expect me to switch. They might anticipate I'll choose rock next.\n\n5. **Choose optimal counter**: If my opponent expects me to switch to rock and they choose paper to counter it, then I should choose scissors to beat their paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors, so I should choose rock.\n\n6. **Make decision based on probability**: Given the tie and the tendency for players to switch after ties, I'll assume they're more likely to switch to scissors (to beat paper if I stick with it) or paper (to beat rock if I switch to rock). Rock seems like the safest bet.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose rock to counter likely scissors or beat paper.\n\n[move] Rock - switching strategy after the tie, expecting opponent to choose scissors or stick with paper\n"

But if they think I'll counter their expected scissors with rock, they might choose paper.\n\n6. **Break the tie pattern**: To maximize my chances of winning rather than tying, I need to think one level deeper.

If we continue the cycle, the next move would be paper, but that would likely result in another tie.\n\n5. **Strategic deviation**: Since we just completed paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, if my opponent expects the cycle to repeat with paper, I should choose scissors to beat paper.
