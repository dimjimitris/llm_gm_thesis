    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 5: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose rock \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 11: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 16: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 17: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Current score: +4 points total\n\n2. Analyze their scissors commitment:\n   - Scissors: rounds 15, 16, 17 (three in a row now)\n   - They didn't switch after losing in round 16\n   - The tie in round 17 might reinforce their scissors choice since it's not a loss\n   - They're showing the same streak behavior with scissors as they did with rock and paper\n\n3. Consider their pattern consistency:\n   - Rock streak: 3 rounds\n   - Paper streak: 5 rounds, then later 4 rounds  \n   - Scissors streak: Currently at 3 rounds\n   - They seem to have a minimum threshold of 3-5 rounds for each choice\n   - The tie might encourage them to continue with scissors\n\n4. Evaluate their next move:\n   - Continue with scissors: High probability given their streak pattern and the tie\n   - Switch to rock: Less likely since they haven't reached their usual switching threshold\n   - Switch to paper: Also less likely for the same reason\n   - Ties seem to reinforce their current choice rather than trigger switches\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they choose scissors again (most likely): I should choose paper\n   - Paper beats scissors and has been successful when I've predicted their streaks correctly\n   - Their pattern suggests they'll stick with scissors for at least one more round\n\n[move] (Opponent has chosen scissors three times in a row and ties seem to reinforce their current choice, expecting another scissors and choosing paper to beat it) paper\n"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I chose paper, opponent chose rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 2: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 3: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 5: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 6: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose rock \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 11: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose paper \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 14: I chose rock, opponent chose paper \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 15: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 16: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 17: I chose scissors, opponent chose scissors \u2192 tie (0 points)\n   - Round 18: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Current score: +5 points total\n\n2. Analyze their extended scissors streak:\n   - Scissors: rounds 15, 16, 17, 18 (four in a row now!)\n   - They just lost again with scissors (second loss in this streak)\n   - Their scissors streak is now matching their longest paper streak length\n   - They've had: 1 win, 1 tie, 2 losses with scissors so far\n\n3. Consider their switching threshold:\n   - Rock: switched after 3 rounds (including losses in rounds 2-3)\n   - Paper: first streak was 5 rounds, second streak was 4 rounds\n   - Scissors: currently at 4 rounds with 2 losses now\n   - They might be approaching their switching point, especially with consecutive losses in rounds 16 and 18\n\n4. Evaluate their likely behavior:\n   - Continue with scissors: Possible but less likely after multiple losses\n   - Switch to rock: Likely, as it's one of their primary choices\n   - Switch to paper: Also likely, their other main choice\n   - Two losses in a scissors streak might trigger a switch\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they switch to rock: I should choose scissors\n   - If they switch to paper: I should choose rock\n   - If they continue with scissors: I should choose paper again\n   - Given their pattern of switching after multiple losses and having both rock and paper as alternatives, I need to pick between countering rock or paper. Since they just came from a long paper phase before scissors, rock seems more likely as their next choice.\n\n[move] (Opponent has lost twice with scissors in their four-round streak and typically switches after multiple losses, predicting they'll switch to rock) scissors\n"

Consider their current rock streak beginning:\n   - They just started a new rock streak in round 19\n   - They lost with rock (which might influence their next choice)\n   - Historically, their rock streaks have been shorter (2-3 rounds) compared to paper (4-5 rounds) and scissors (4 rounds)\n   - They might continue with rock for at least one more round despite the loss\n\n4. Evaluate their switching patterns:\n   - They tend to stick with choices for multiple rounds even after losses\n   - Rock has been their least \"sticky\" choice historically\n   - But they just switched to rock, so they might give it a few rounds\n   - One loss usually doesn't trigger an immediate switch\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they continue with rock (likely): I should choose scissors again\n   - If they switch to paper: I should choose rock\n   - If they switch back to scissors: I should choose paper\n   - Given they just started a rock streak and tend to stick with new choices for multiple rounds, scissors seems like the best choice\n\n[move] (Opponent just started a new rock streak and typically sticks with choices for multiple rounds despite initial losses, choosing scissors to beat their likely rock) scissors\n"

Consider their current scissors streak:\n   - They just started a new scissors streak in round 23\n   - They lost with scissors, but historically they persist through initial losses\n   - Their previous scissors streak lasted 4 rounds (rounds 15-18)\n   - They're likely to continue with scissors for at least one more round\n\n4. Evaluate their next move probability:\n   - Continue with scissors: High probability based on their streak behavior\n   - Switch to rock: Less likely since they just started scissors streak\n   - Switch to paper: Very unlikely since they just left paper after losses\n   - One loss with a new choice typically doesn't trigger immediate switching\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - If they choose scissors again (most likely): I should choose paper again\n   - Paper has been very effective against their scissors\n   - Their pattern strongly suggests they'll persist with scissors despite the loss\n\n[move] (Opponent just started new scissors streak and historically persists with new choices despite initial losses, choosing paper to beat their likely scissors) paper\n"
