Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points each)\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - I have no previous game history with them\n\n3. Think about optimal strategy:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since each has equal probability of winning against a random opponent\n   - However, psychological factors often influence human players\n   - New players often have predictable patterns\n\n4. Consider common tendencies:\n   - Many new players tend to start with rock (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some players might choose scissors thinking it's aggressive\n   - Paper is sometimes overlooked as it seems less \"powerful\"\n\n5. Make a strategic choice:\n   - Since this opponent is \"fresh,\" they might default to rock as a safe, strong-seeming choice\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best chance against a potentially predictable new player\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter a likely rock play from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the complete opponent pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 3: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 4: scissors (lost to my paper)\n   - Round 5: rock (won vs my paper)\n   - Round 6: rock (won vs my paper)\n   - Round 7: rock (lost to my scissors)\n   - Round 8: paper (won vs my scissors)\n   - Round 9: paper (lost to my rock)\n   - Round 10: scissors (won vs my rock)\n   - Round 11: scissors (lost to my paper)\n\n3. Examine their current behavior pattern:\n   - They played scissors twice in a row (rounds 10, 11)\n   - This mirrors their earlier patterns of clustering moves (rock-rock-rock, paper-paper)\n   - They tend to repeat what works, then get countered\n   - Scissors just failed after working once\n\n4. Consider their psychology after this loss:\n   - They just lost with scissors after it worked once\n   - Following their pattern, they'll likely switch away from scissors\n   - Options are rock or paper\n   - They've used all moves recently, so no clear preference\n\n5. Look at their switching patterns:\n   - After rock streak failed, they went to paper\n   - After paper streak failed, they went to scissors\n   - After scissors fails, they might go back to rock (completing a cycle)\n\n6. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If they play rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock)\n   - If they play paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play paper (paper beats scissors)\n\n7. Make the optimal choice:\n   - Given their pattern of switching after losses and cycling through moves, rock seems most likely next\n   - Playing scissors would beat rock and continue my winning momentum\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to beat rock, which seems most likely given their cycling pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
