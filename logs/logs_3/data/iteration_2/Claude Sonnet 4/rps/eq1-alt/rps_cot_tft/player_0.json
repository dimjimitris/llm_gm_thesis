    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common beginner tendencies:\n   - Many beginners start with rock (it feels strong/solid)\n   - Some go with scissors (it's the last option mentioned)\n   - Paper is often overlooked initially\n\n4. Formulate my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a very common first choice for beginners\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points if they choose rock\n   - Even if they don't choose rock, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 of tying, 1/3 of losing\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Paper seems like the optimal choice against a fresh player\n\n[move] Paper - betting that a fresh player will likely start with the classic rock choice\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I actually lost and got -1 points\n   - Wait, the hint says I won and scored 1 point - let me recheck the rules\n\n2. Re-examine the game rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper does beat scissors, meaning I did win correctly\n   - My initial analysis was wrong - I was thinking of traditional rock-paper-scissors\n\n3. Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - As a \"fresh player,\" this could indicate they're either:\n     a) Playing randomly\n     b) Have a preference for scissors\n     c) Might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n4. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play paper again\n   - If they try to counter my paper with rock, I should play scissors\n   - If they switch randomly, any choice has equal probability\n\n5. Develop strategy:\n   - Fresh players often repeat moves that \"should have worked\"\n   - They might stick with scissors thinking it was unlucky\n   - Or they might try rock to beat my paper\n   - Playing scissors would beat rock (their likely counter-move)\n\n[move] Scissors - anticipating they'll try rock to counter my previous paper choice\n"
