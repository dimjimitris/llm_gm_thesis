    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some might go with scissors as it sounds aggressive\n   - Paper is often less intuitive as a first choice\n\n4. Develop my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a very common first move for beginners, I should play paper to beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning points in the first round\n   - If I'm wrong, the worst case is losing 1 point, but the potential upside is +1 point\n\n5.

Consider a radical shift:\n   - Instead of trying to predict what they'll do, I need to break the synchronization\n   - I should choose based on a completely different logic\n   - Maybe choose the move that's been played least overall\n\n5. Count total moves across all rounds:\n   - Looking at my opponent's moves: paper(3), rock(5), scissors(2)\n   - Scissors has been their least chosen move\n   - But if I think this way, they might too...\n\n6. Make a decisive break:\n   - I need to stop the analytical approach entirely\n   - Choose the move that feels most different from the recent pattern\n   - We just played rock, before that scissors, before that paper\n   - I'll go with paper - not because of strategy, but to break the cycle\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This is crucial - I've been playing with the wrong understanding!\n   - I thought it was rock > scissors > paper > rock (traditional rules)\n   - But it's actually paper > scissors > rock > paper\n   - This explains some of my previous losses and strategy errors\n\n4. Recalculate my previous rounds with correct rules:\n   - Round 4: Me paper vs opponent rock - rock beats paper (I lose \u2713)\n   - Round 6: Me paper vs opponent scissors - paper beats scissors (I win \u2713)  \n   - Round 8: Me scissors vs opponent paper - paper beats scissors (I lose \u2713)\n   - Round 11: Me paper vs opponent scissors - paper beats scissors (I win \u2713)\n\n5. Now with correct rules, analyze opponent's likely next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors against my paper\n   - If they understand the rules correctly, they know rock beats paper\n   - They might choose rock to beat my potential paper\n\n6.

            "text": "I need to analyze this tie and understand why we're synchronizing again despite my recent losses.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review what just happened:\n   - Round 21: Both chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: 0 points\n   - Back to synchronization after opponent had been winning\n\n2. Analyze recent performance:\n   - Round 18: I lost (me paper vs opponent rock)\n   - Round 19: Tie (both scissors)\n   - Round 20: I lost (me rock vs opponent scissors)  \n   - Round 21: Tie (both paper)\n   - I've only scored 0 points in the last 4 rounds\n\n3. Recognize the pattern:\n   - When we make different moves, I tend to lose\n   - When we make the same moves, we tie\n   - The opponent seems better at predicting when to break synchronization\n   - They win when it matters, tie when it's safe\n\n4. Consider what this means:\n   - The opponent might be deliberately managing the synchronization\n   - They break it when they can win, maintain it otherwise\n   - This suggests they're more strategically sophisticated than I initially thought\n   - Or they're getting lucky with timing\n\n5. Think about my position:\n   - I'm back to 0 points total\n   - I had gotten up to +2 points earlier but have lost that advantage\n   - I need to start winning rounds again, not just tying\n\n6. Try a different approach:\n   - We just both played paper\n   - If this is truly random/equal probability, I should just pick any move\n   - But if they're managing synchronization, they might expect me to follow a pattern\n   - Let me choose scissors - it beats paper if they repeat, loses to rock if they switch strategically\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Review what just happened:\n   - Round 22: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock\n   - Scissors beats rock, so I won and scored +1 point\n   - Current total score: +1 points\n\n2. Analyze what this win tells me:\n   - I correctly predicted they wouldn't stick with paper\n   - They switched to rock (perhaps following the cycle: paper \u2192 rock)\n   - My choice of scissors beat their rock\n   - This suggests they might be following cycle logic more predictably now\n\n3. Look at the recent sequence:\n   - Round 21: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: Me scissors, opponent rock (I won)\n   - If they're following a cycle pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - They might choose scissors next\n\n4. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with rock against my scissors\n   - They know paper beats scissors (from the rules)\n   - There's a high probability they'll switch to paper to counter scissors\n   - This would also continue the cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If opponent chooses paper (to beat scissors): I should choose rock (rock beats paper)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (following cycle): We tie\n   - If opponent chooses rock (repeating): I should choose scissors again\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - The most logical move for opponent is paper (to beat my winning scissors)\n   - This also fits the cycle pattern they seem to be following\n   - I should choose rock to beat their expected paper\n   - This continues my successful counter-prediction strategy\n\n[move] Rock\n"
