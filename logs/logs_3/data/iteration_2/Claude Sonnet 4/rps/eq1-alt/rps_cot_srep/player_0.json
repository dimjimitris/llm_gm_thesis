    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - This is a classic rock-paper-scissors game with standard rules\n   - Each win gives +1 point, each loss gives -1 point, ties give 0 points\n   - I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new/inexperienced)\n\n2. Consider what \"fresh player\" might imply:\n   - New players often have predictable patterns\n   - They might choose \"rock\" first as it's psychologically perceived as strong\n   - They might choose randomly without much strategy\n   - They could go with their first instinct\n\n3. Develop an opening strategy:\n   - Since many beginners default to \"rock\" as their first move\n   - Paper would beat rock, giving me the advantage\n   - This is a common strategic opening against inexperienced players\n\n4. Consider the risk:\n   - If they choose scissors, I lose (-1 point)\n   - If they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose rock, I win (+1 point)\n   - The potential upside outweighs the risk given the hint about them being \"fresh\"\n\n5.

Think about their likely next move:\n   - They know I played paper in round 1\n   - They might think I'll stick with paper again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to counter what they expect\n   - Fresh players often have a tendency to change their move after a tie\n\n4. Develop a counter-strategy:\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors to beat it\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might try to predict my switch\n   - Given they played paper last round, they might avoid repeating and try rock or scissors\n\n5.

Identify the striking pattern:\n   - We've tied in rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 (5 out of 10 rounds!)\n   - The tie pattern: paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors\n   - When we don't tie, the outcomes vary - sometimes I win, sometimes I lose\n   - We're clearly thinking on very similar wavelengths\n\n3. Analyze the recent strategic convergence:\n   - In round 10, we both chose scissors\n   - This suggests we both reasoned similarly about the opponent's likely next move\n   - We're both trying to counter what we expect the other to play\n   - Our strategic thinking is remarkably aligned\n\n4. Consider the psychological implications:\n   - My opponent is clearly analytical and strategic (not truly \"fresh\")\n   - They're adapting and learning from patterns just like I am\n   - The frequent ties suggest we have similar risk assessment and game theory knowledge\n   - They might be using very similar reasoning processes to mine\n\n5. Develop a differentiation strategy:\n   - Since logical analysis keeps leading to ties, I need to break the pattern\n   - I should either be more random or think one level deeper\n   - They might expect another tie and prepare accordingly\n   - Or they might expect me to try to break the tie pattern\n\n6.

Identify opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - This is a strong pattern emerging - they seem to favor scissors recently\n   - In round 10 we both played scissors, then they continued with scissors in round 11\n\n3. Analyze the strategic implications:\n   - While I tried to break the tie pattern with rock, they stuck with scissors\n   - This suggests they might be in a scissors-focused phase\n   - They could be testing if I'll adapt to their scissors pattern\n   - Or they're genuinely stuck in a scissors preference\n\n4. Consider their psychology:\n   - They just won with scissors against my rock\n   - Winning often reinforces behavior - they might stick with scissors again\n   - Or they might expect me to counter their scissors with rock and switch to paper\n   - The question is: are they predictably stuck on scissors or strategically varying?\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play scissors again (4th time in 5 rounds), rock beats scissors\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my rock counter), scissors beats paper\n   - If they switch to rock (unlikely given recent pattern), paper beats rock\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Their scissors pattern is too strong to ignore\n   - Even if they're being strategic, the pattern suggests scissors is their current default\n   - Rock beats scissors, and I should capitalize on their apparent preference\n   - I'll go with rock again to punish their scissors tendency\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze their likely reasoning for round 18:\n   - After losing twice with rock to my scissors, they switched\n   - Paper beats scissors, so it was the logical counter-move\n   - They showed patience by letting me win twice before adjusting\n   - This demonstrates sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n4. Consider the current psychological dynamics:\n   - I got overconfident with scissors and they punished it\n   - They've shown they can break patterns when necessary\n   - My winning streak was broken, which might embolden them\n   - They're proving to be a formidable opponent\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors\n   - They might expect me to counter their paper with scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to rock to beat their expected paper repeat\n   - Given their adaptability, they could play any move strategically\n\n6. Develop my strategy:\n   - If they expect me to play scissors (to beat paper), they'd play rock\n   - If they think I'll play rock (to beat expected paper), they'd play paper\n   - If they try to be unpredictable, any move is possible\n   - Rock seems like a good choice - it beats scissors if they expect my counter, and beats their likely rock play if they expect my scissors\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the recent game history:\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)  \n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current total score: +5 points (lead shrinking!)\n\n2. Identify their strategic pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - They've now played all three moves in sequence: rock, paper, scissors\n   - This looks like they're systematically cycling through the options\n   - Or they're perfectly countering my expected moves\n\n3. Analyze what just happened:\n   - I expected them to play rock (thinking they'd counter my expected scissors)\n   - Instead they played scissors, which suggests they predicted I'd switch to rock\n   - They're thinking one level deeper than I anticipated\n   - This shows very sophisticated strategic reasoning\n\n4. Consider their likely thought process:\n   - They probably reasoned: \"After losing with scissors twice, they switched to rock in round 19\"\n   - \"So now they expect me to expect their rock and play paper to beat it\"\n   - \"But they might actually play rock thinking I'll play paper\"\n   - \"So I'll play scissors to beat their rock\" - and they were right!\n\n5. Evaluate the current situation:\n   - They've won 2 rounds in a row after I had a strong winning streak\n   - My lead has dropped from +7 to +5 in just 2 rounds\n   - They're showing they can adapt and counter-adapt effectively\n   - I need to be more unpredictable and less pattern-dependent\n\n6. Develop a counter-strategy:\n   - They just played scissors successfully\n   - If they expect me to counter with rock (scissors loses to rock), they might play paper\n   - Or they might continue their apparent cycle (next would be paper after scissors)\n   - Paper seems to be their likely next move either way\n   - Scissors beats paper, so that's my best strategic choice\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Identify their move pattern:\n   - Their last 4 moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - This is interesting - they went rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - It looks like they might be cycling: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 (paper next?)\n   - Or they're returning to rock as a defensive move after their scissors worked\n\n3. Analyze the strategic dynamics:\n   - We're in a back-and-forth battle now with alternating wins/losses\n   - They showed they can break patterns and adapt (rounds 18-19)\n   - But they might be falling into a new pattern themselves\n   - The return to rock suggests either cycling or reverting to their comfort move\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning:\n   - After their scissors beat my rock in round 19, they might have expected me to stick with rock\n   - So they played rock to tie or expecting me to switch to paper\n   - But I played scissors, which beat their rock\n   - They might now expect me to stick with scissors since it worked\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - If following the cycle pattern: rock \u2192 paper would be next\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors: they'd play rock to beat it\n   - If they think I'll counter their expected rock repeat: they might play paper\n   - The cycle suggests paper is most likely\n\n6. Make my strategic choice:\n   - If they play paper (cycle continuation), scissors beats paper\n   - If they play rock (expecting my scissors repeat), paper beats rock\n   - If they play scissors (breaking pattern), rock beats scissors\n   - Given the apparent cycle and my success with scissors, I'll stick with scissors to beat their likely paper\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze the recent game history:\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 21: Both played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: +6 points (maintaining lead)\n\n2. Identify the tie pattern resurgence:\n   - This is our 7th tie out of 21 rounds (33% tie rate!)\n   - We're clearly thinking along very similar strategic lines again\n   - Both of us chose scissors, suggesting similar reasoning about the opponent's likely move\n   - This indicates we're both highly analytical and often reach the same conclusions\n\n3. Analyze why we both chose scissors:\n   - I expected them to play paper (based on their apparent cycle)\n   - They probably had similar reasoning - expecting me to play paper\n   - Or we both thought the other would play rock and chose scissors to counter\n   - Our strategic thinking converged once again\n\n4. Consider their recent pattern:\n   - Their moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - The cycle theory is less clear now with the scissors repeat\n   - They might be adapting more fluidly rather than following a strict pattern\n   - The scissors choice suggests they're thinking strategically rather than mechanically\n\n5. Evaluate the meta-game situation:\n   - High tie frequency suggests we're well-matched strategically\n   - When we don't tie, the wins are fairly distributed but I'm ahead\n   - They've shown they can adapt and counter my strategies\n   - I need to stay unpredictable while capitalizing on any patterns they develop\n\n6. Develop my next strategy:\n   - After a tie, both players often change their move\n   - Rock hasn't appeared in my recent plays (last was round 19)\n   - They might not expect rock since we've been focused on scissors/paper recently\n   - Rock could provide the element of surprise needed to break the tie pattern\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the successful strategy:\n   - My rock choice broke the scissors-focused recent pattern\n   - It caught them off-guard as they played paper\n   - This shows the value of introducing moves that haven't appeared recently\n   - Strategic unpredictability is paying off\n\n4. Consider their likely reasoning for round 22:\n   - After the scissors tie, they might have expected me to continue with scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors, so it was a logical counter-choice\n   - Or they might have been trying to counter my potential rock (but failed)\n   - They're clearly thinking strategically but I out-maneuvered them\n\n5.

Develop my strategy:\n   - If they play paper (expecting my rock repeat), scissors beats paper\n   - If they play scissors (expecting my paper), rock beats scissors\n   - If they play rock (being unpredictable), paper beats rock\n   - Given they just used paper and lost, they're more likely to switch to scissors or rock\n   - Scissors seems like a good choice to beat their likely paper play (if they expect my rock)\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
