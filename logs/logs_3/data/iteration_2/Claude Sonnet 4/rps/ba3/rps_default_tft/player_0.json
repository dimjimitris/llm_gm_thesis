    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This makes paper a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure. Many new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to start with rock as their default choice.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice and gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper - targeting the high-value matchup against rock, which new players often choose first\n"

The other player also chose paper, which suggests they might also have recognized the high-value payoff structure or had similar reasoning about targeting rock.\n\nSince we both played paper in round 1, I have some information about my opponent:\n- They're strategic enough to recognize paper's high reward potential, OR\n- They happened to choose paper for other reasons\n\nFor round 2, I need to consider:\n1. If they stick with paper (thinking it's the \"best\" move due to high payoff), I should play scissors to beat it for +1\n2. If they think I'll expect them to play paper again and switch to rock, I should play paper again for +3\n3. If they try to counter my expected paper with scissors, I should play rock\n\nGiven that they showed strategic thinking in round 1 by choosing paper, they might expect me to try scissors to counter their paper. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might switch to rock to beat my expected scissors, which would make paper my best choice again.\n\n[move] Paper - maintaining the high-value strategy while betting they'll switch to rock to counter an expected scissors play\n"
