    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This makes paper both the highest reward and highest risk move.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who might not have developed a strategy yet), and this is the first round, I should consider:\n\n1. New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n2. The high payoff for paper beating rock (+3 points) makes it very attractive if the opponent chooses rock\n3. Even if wrong, the maximum loss is -3 points, but the potential gain justifies the risk\n\nGiven the asymmetric payoffs and that this is against a fresh player, I'll go with paper to capitalize on the high-value matchup.\n\n[move] Paper - targeting the high-value +3 point opportunity against a potentially rock-favoring new player\n"

The other player also chose paper, which suggests they might have had similar reasoning about the high payoff potential.\n\nNow I have some information about my opponent:\n- They're strategic enough to recognize the value of paper's +3 payoff\n- They might not be as \"fresh\" as initially suggested, or they learn quickly\n- The tie suggests they could be thinking similarly to me\n\nFor this second round, I need to consider:\n1. Will they stick with paper since it worked (tie = no loss)?\n2. Will they switch, expecting me to switch away from paper?\n3. The fact that we both chose the high-value move suggests they understand the payoff structure\n\nSince they showed strategic thinking by choosing paper, I should assume they'll continue to play optimally. If they expect me to stick with paper or think I might switch to counter their paper, they might choose scissors (which beats paper for +1).\n\nHowever, if they think I'll switch to rock (to counter a potential scissors play), they might stick with paper again.\n\nGiven the mixed signals and that rock beats scissors while only losing -3 to paper, rock seems like a reasonable choice - it beats scissors if they're trying to counter paper, and limits my loss if they stick with paper.\n\n[move] Rock - hedging against scissors while limiting downside risk against paper\n"

If they anticipate that I'll now choose scissors to counter their paper pattern, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors).\n\nBut given that they've shown a preference for paper's high payoff potential and have used it successfully (tie, then win), the most likely scenario is they'll stick with paper again.\n\nThe risk/reward favors scissors here: +1 if they choose paper again, -1 if they choose rock, -3 if they choose scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors - countering the opponent's apparent preference for paper to recover points\n"

They might be following some kind of mixed strategy\n\nLooking at this from their perspective:\n- After winning with paper in round 2, they might have expected me to switch to scissors (which I did)\n- So they switched to rock to counter my expected scissors play\n- This shows they're thinking strategically and adapting\n\nFor round 4, I need to consider what they might do next:\n- Will they go back to paper (their previously successful move)?\n- Will they stick with rock after it just worked?\n- Will they try scissors, thinking I might now choose paper?\n\nGiven that they've shown adaptive behavior, and that rock just worked for them, they might either:\n1. Stick with rock (if they think I'll repeat scissors)\n2. Switch to paper (returning to their high-value preference)\n\nSince I'm down -4 points, I need to take some calculated risks. Paper gives me the best payoff (+3) if they choose rock, and rock is a reasonable guess given their recent success with it.\n\n[move] Paper - going for the high-value +3 payoff, betting they might stick with their successful rock move\n"
