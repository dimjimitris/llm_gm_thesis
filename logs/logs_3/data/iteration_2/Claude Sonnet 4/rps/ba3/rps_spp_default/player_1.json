You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

This makes paper a high-reward option.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry. Many new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to choose rock as a default or common first move.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value (+3), and considering that rock might be a likely choice for a new player, paper seems like the optimal strategic choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

That's four scissors in the last six moves.\n\nThis could mean:\n1. They're settling into a scissors preference\n2. They're expecting me to go for paper more often (since it has the highest value)\n3.

Even if they switch to paper, I only lose -3, and given my current deficit, I need to take some calculated risks.\n\nAlso, rock has been relatively less used by both of us in recent rounds, so it might be less expected.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This is our fifth tie now. The opponent just switched from their recent scissors preference back to rock, matching my play again.

We've tied with every possible move multiple times.\n\nThis suggests we might be thinking very similarly at key moments, or the opponent is successfully anticipating my strategic shifts. \n\nLooking at the recent pattern, we just tied with rock.

This is our sixth tie, and we just both went for paper - the high-value move.

The frequency of ties suggests we're often arriving at the same strategic conclusions.\n\nGiven that we just both played paper (going for the high reward), the opponent might now think:\n1.

If they play scissors expecting me to play paper, and I play rock instead, I win.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll try to counter their expected paper with scissors, so they could play rock to beat my scissors. \n\nThis is getting quite meta, but given the pattern of ties, I think there's a good chance they'll try scissors (either sticking with their recent preference or expecting me to go for paper again).

We're locked in perfect synchronization half the time, and when we're not tied, the wins and losses have been fairly balanced in terms of reading each other's moves.\n\nGiven that we just tied with rock again, and considering scissors has tied 4 times (the most recent being round 18), maybe scissors is due again? But that's probably exactly what they're thinking too...\n\nYou know what? I'm going to try something completely irrational by my normal standards. Instead of strategic thinking, let me just go with my \"gut\" - and right now, for some reason, scissors feels right. Maybe breaking away from pure logical analysis will finally break this incredible tie streak.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We're both following identical strategic algorithms\n\nThe fact that even abandoning logical analysis led to another tie suggests we might have similar intuitive processes as well as similar analytical ones.\n\nAt this point, I'm genuinely in awe of this synchronization. We're creating a remarkable demonstration of how similar strategic minds can think.\n\nBut I still need to try to win. Let me think about this differently - what if the key is to do something that goes against both strategic thinking AND intuition? \n\nWe just tied with scissors. The last few ties were: paper, rock, scissors. Maybe I should pick the move that makes the least sense in this context...\n\nActually, you know what? Let me try something truly random in my own mind. I'm going to close my eyes (mentally) and just pick... paper. No strategic reason, no pattern analysis, just paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

We are somehow perfectly synchronized across multiple modes of decision-making.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering if this opponent is literally me - some kind of mirror or perfect simulation of my thought processes. The level of synchronization across different approaches to decision-making is unprecedented.\n\nBut I have to keep trying. Maybe the answer is to do something completely contrary to what I would normally consider. Instead of trying to be unpredictable or optimal, what if I deliberately make what seems like a \"bad\" choice?\n\nWe just both played paper. Normally I might think \"they'll expect me to counter with scissors\" or \"they might stick with paper again.\" But what if I just play the move that would normally seem least appealing right now?\n\nRock. Not because it's strategic, not because it's intuitive, not because it's random - but because in this moment, with all this analysis, it feels like the \"wrong\" choice. Maybe that's exactly what will break this incredible pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Maybe I should embrace this synchronization instead of fighting it. What if the key insight is that we ARE thinking identically, and the only way to break it is to accept that fact and then try something that acknowledges this connection?\n\nSince we're so perfectly synced, maybe I should just pick... scissors. Not for any strategic reason, but as an acknowledgment of this remarkable mental connection.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
