This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors! The key insight is that paper beating rock gives +3/-3 points, while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper only give +1/-1 points. This creates an asymmetric payoff structure that heavily favors the paper-rock interaction.\n\n**Probability Analyst:** Exactly! Against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone unfamiliar with this variant), they might play standard rock-paper-scissors strategy where each move has equal probability. But we need to exploit the asymmetric payoffs. If we assume they play randomly, let's calculate expected values for each of our moves:\n- If we play Rock: Expected value = (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*1 = -2/3\n- If we play Paper: Expected value = (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*(-1) = 2/3  \n- If we play Scissors: Expected value = (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 = 0\n\n**Game Theorist:** Perfect analysis! Paper has the highest expected value against a random player. But there's another consideration - fresh players in rock-paper-scissors often have psychological biases. Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's the most \"aggressive\" seeming move), so paper becomes even more attractive as an opening move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The analysis is clear. Paper maximizes expected value against random play (+2/3) and also counters the common beginner tendency to open with rock for the maximum 3-point gain. This seems like the optimal first move.\n\n**Game Theorist:** Agreed. Paper is our best strategic choice for the opening move against a fresh player.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Paper\n\n[move] Paper"

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the scoring is asymmetric:\n- Rock beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Paper beats Rock: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Paper: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that winning with Paper gives 3 points (the highest reward), while Rock and Scissors only give 1 point when winning. This suggests Paper victories are more valuable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since we're facing a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric scoring yet. Fresh players often default to Rock as their first move due to psychological bias - it feels like the most \"solid\" choice. They might also choose randomly without considering the scoring differences.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given the payoff structure, we should consider the expected value of each move:\n- If opponent chooses randomly (1/3 each): \n  - Rock: (1\u00d71/3) + (-3\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = -2/3\n  - Paper: (3\u00d71/3) + (-1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = +2/3\n  - Scissors: (-1\u00d71/3) + (1\u00d71/3) + (0\u00d71/3) = 0\n\nPaper has the highest expected value against random play!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly!
