    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper beating rock gives 3 points instead of 1, making it asymmetric. This means we should heavily favor playing paper when we think the opponent will play rock, since the payoff is triple the normal amount.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoffs yet.

The opponent also played paper, which suggests they might have similar strategic thinking or they're not as \"fresh\" as initially described. This could mean:\n1. They also recognized the asymmetric payoff structure\n2. They're thinking strategically about maximizing expected value\n3. They might continue with paper or try to counter-adapt\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Now we have more information. The fact that they played paper suggests they understand the game's asymmetry. If they're strategic, they might:\n1. Stick with paper (thinking it's optimal)\n2. Switch to scissors to counter my likely paper play\n3. Try to be unpredictable\n\nGiven that they played optimally in round 1, I need to consider they might anticipate my paper strategy. If they expect me to play paper again, they'll play scissors for the +1 advantage.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the key question is: do they think I'll stick with paper or adapt? If they expect me to repeat paper, they'll play scissors. But if they think I'll switch to counter their scissors expectation, they might stick with paper or go to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that we both played the \"optimal\" move and tied, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Stick with what seemed \"right\" (paper again)\n2. Try to be clever and counter-counter (anticipating they'll play scissors to beat my expected paper)\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis: If they're strategic and think I'll repeat paper, they'll play scissors. So I should play rock to beat their scissors. But if they think I'll think this way, they might play paper again or rock. This creates a complex meta-game.\n\nHowever, rock has a decent expected value:\n- vs Paper: -3 points (bad)\n- vs Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- vs Scissors: +1 point (good)\n\nIf there's reasonable chance they'll play scissors (expecting my paper), rock could work well.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I think rock is the right play here. They likely expect me to repeat paper, so they'll probably play scissors to counter it.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely scissors play, since they probably expect me to repeat paper.\n\n[move] (They likely expect me to play paper again after our tie, so they'll probably choose scissors to counter it - I'll play rock to beat their scissors) rock\n"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Excellent prediction! My read was correct - they played scissors expecting me to repeat paper. Now I have valuable information about their thinking pattern:\n1. They do think strategically about countering\n2. They anticipated I'd stick with my previous \"optimal\" move\n3. They're playing at a level where they try to counter-predict\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Great execution! Now for round 3, the meta-game deepens. They know that:\n1. I successfully predicted their counter-move\n2. I'm thinking at least one level ahead\n3. I won't just repeat the same strategy\n\nThey might now think I'll expect them to expect me to play rock again, so they could play paper to counter my expected rock. Or they might try to be unpredictable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So the question is: what level of thinking are they operating on now? If they think I'll stick with rock (since it just won), they'll play paper for the big +3 points. But if they think I'm sophisticated enough to switch, they might try something else.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing, there's often a psychological impulse to either:\n1. \"Correct\" the mistake by playing what would have won (paper to beat my rock)\n2. Try to be unpredictable and play randomly\n3. Attempt to out-think me by going deeper\n\nGiven they've shown strategic thinking, I lean toward them playing paper to counter what they might think is my \"winning strategy.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper (likely), I should play scissors for the +1. If they try to be random or play rock, scissors vs rock gives me -1, which isn't terrible. Let's analyze scissors:\n- vs Paper: +1 point (good, and likely scenario)\n- vs Rock: -1 point (manageable loss)  \n- vs Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nGiven the high probability they'll play paper to counter my \"successful\" rock strategy, scissors has strong expected value.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I agree. They're likely to play paper thinking I'll repeat rock, so scissors is the logical counter-play.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors because they likely expect me to repeat rock and will counter with paper.\n\n[move] (They probably expect me to stick with rock since it just won, so they'll likely play paper to get the +3 points - I'll counter with scissors) scissors\n"
