    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties award 0 points\n\n2. Identify the asymmetry in payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - Playing paper has the highest potential reward but also highest potential penalty\n   - Playing rock or scissors has lower risk/reward\n   - Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), they might not recognize the payoff asymmetry\n\n4. Formulate initial strategy:\n   - Since paper offers the highest reward potential (+3), and a fresh player may not immediately recognize this advantage, playing paper could be profitable\n   - Fresh players often default to rock in rock-paper-scissors games\n   - If they play rock, I win big with paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Make the decision:\n   - The high reward potential of paper outweighs the risk against an inexperienced player\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable for one round\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze what happened:\n   - The other player also chose paper\n   - This suggests they might also recognize the high payoff potential of paper\n   - They're not as \"fresh\" as initially assumed if they chose the optimal high-reward move\n\n2. Reconsider the opponent's likely strategy:\n   - If they chose paper for the same reason I did (high reward potential), they might stick with it\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper after the tie\n   - They could also be thinking one level deeper about my strategy\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a paper-playing opponent:\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors against their paper: I win (+1 point)\n   - If I play rock against their paper: I lose (-3 points)\n\n4. Consider the meta-game:\n   - Playing scissors beats paper and gives me +1 point\n   - The risk is lower than the paper vs rock scenario\n   - If they're thinking I'll stick with paper, scissors is a good counter\n\n5. Make the strategic decision:\n   - Since they showed they understand the paper advantage, I should counter with scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper with a reasonable +1 reward\n   - Lower risk than continuing with paper against a potentially paper-focused opponent\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Strategic reasoning:\n   - Paper offers the highest reward potential (+3) if they stick with rock\n   - Even if wrong, I can afford some risk since I'm only down 1 point\n   - The high payoff of paper vs rock makes it worth the gamble\n   - Since they just won with rock, they might be inclined to repeat it\n\n6.

Consider their potential next move:\n   - If they think I'll stick with scissors (since it's been working), they might play rock to counter\n   - Rock beats scissors and would give them +1\n   - This could be their logical next move\n\n4. Determine my best counter-strategy:\n   - If they play rock, I should play paper for the big +3 point win\n   - This would significantly help my recovery from -5 points\n   - Paper vs rock is my highest value opportunity\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - If they play scissors instead: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play paper: I lose (-1 point)\n   - But the potential +3 gain from beating rock makes it worth the risk\n\n6.

Review my current situation:\n   - Current total score: -12 points\n   - Just lost scissors vs rock (my typical losing matchup)\n   - The pattern continues: scissors beats paper, loses to rock\n\n2. Examine the opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 4 moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They just switched from paper back to rock after I won with scissors\n   - This suggests they might be countering when I succeed\n\n3. Consider what beats rock:\n   - Paper beats rock for +3 points\n   - If they stick with rock or expect me to play scissors again, paper could work\n   - This would be a significant point gain for my recovery\n\n4. Analyze my paper performance historically:\n   - Paper record: 0 wins, 6 losses\n   - But most losses were only -1 point (vs scissors)\n   - Only one big -3 loss (vs scissors in round 8)\n   - The risk/reward might be worth it\n\n5. Think about the opponent's perspective:\n   - They just successfully countered my scissors with rock\n   - They might expect me to try scissors again since it's my only winner\n   - Playing rock again to counter scissors would make sense for them\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play rock expecting scissors, paper beats rock for +3\n   - Even if they play scissors, I only lose -1\n   - The potential +3 gain could significantly help my -12 deficit\n   - I need to take calculated risks to recover\n   - Paper counters their likely rock play\n\n[move] (Trying to counter their likely rock with paper for the big points) paper\n"

Consider the implications:\n   - If they're following a Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle, their next move would be rock\n   - If they're countering my scissors tendency, they might play rock again\n   - Rock beats scissors, so this could be their logical next move\n\n4.

Assess the risk/reward:\n   - Paper vs rock gives +3 (major recovery potential)\n   - Paper vs scissors gives -1 (manageable loss)\n   - Paper vs paper gives 0 (neutral)\n   - The potential +3 gain is very appealing given my -12 deficit\n\n6.

Notice the pattern in recent ties:\n   - Round 20: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)  \n   - Round 22: I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n   - They're matching my moves exactly\n\n3.

Evaluate this strategy:\n   - Scissors vs paper has been my only winning combination\n   - If they're copying and play paper, I win +1\n   - If they're not copying, I still have a chance depending on what they play\n   - Scissors remains my most successful move historically\n\n6.
