    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.

My total remains at 13 points.\n\nTheir recent sequence:\n- Round 19: paper (lost)\n- Round 20: rock (lost)\n- Round 21: scissors (lost)\n- Round 22: paper (tie)\n- Round 23: scissors (tie)\n\nUpdated record:\n- Rock: 2 wins, 5 losses, 2 ties\n- Scissors: 2 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties\n- Paper: 1 win, 4 losses, 2 ties\n\nThis is fascinating! They switched from paper to scissors, and now they've had two ties in a row. For a player who was in a terrible losing streak, these back-to-back ties might feel like a major turnaround.\n\nThe psychological impact of going from losing 4 of 5 rounds to getting 2 ties in a row could be huge for this fresh player. They might be gaining confidence again and thinking they've found their rhythm.\n\nThey might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just tied (and ties feel good after losses)\n2. Try a different move since they're feeling more confident\n3. Go back to paper since it also just tied\n\nGiven that they've now had success (or at least non-failure) with both paper and scissors in the last two rounds, they might feel emboldened to try either again. However, scissors just tied and might feel \"safer\" or \"luckier\" right now.\n\nIf they stick with scissors, my rock beats it (+1 point).\nIf they switch to paper, my scissors beats it (+1 point).\nIf they try rock, my paper beats it (+3 points).\n\nI think they're more likely to stick with scissors after the tie gave them confidence, so I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"
