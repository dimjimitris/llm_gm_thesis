    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs: Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3), while rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper only give +1/-1.\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who hasn't developed patterns yet):\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper to get the maximum +3 points\n   - This is also the highest-value win available in the game\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose 3 points  \n   - If opponent chooses rock, I win 3 points\n   - Expected value seems favorable given fresh players' tendency toward rock\n\n5.

Update my knowledge:\n   - The opponent also chose paper in round 1\n   - This suggests they might also be thinking strategically about maximizing points\n   - They may have had similar reasoning about fresh players choosing rock\n\n2. Analyze opponent's likely thought process:\n   - If they're strategic, they know paper gives the highest payoff (+3) when it wins\n   - They might expect me to choose rock (thinking I'm a \"fresh player\")\n   - Or they might stick with paper thinking it's the optimal choice\n\n3. Consider counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper, I should choose scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (expecting me to play paper again), I should choose paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent chooses scissors (expecting me to stick with paper), I should choose rock (+1 point)\n\n4. Meta-reasoning:\n   - Since we both chose paper, the opponent likely recognizes the high-value nature of that move\n   - They might expect me to switch away from paper\n   - A good strategy might be to choose scissors, as it beats paper and many players stick with their previous \"good\" choice\n\n5.

Consider their psychological state:\n   - Two consecutive losses might make them more desperate/reactive\n   - They might try rock (which worked in rounds 2 and 7 against my scissors)\n   - Or they might try scissors to counter expected paper (if they think I'll go for +3)\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock (likely counter to my recent scissors success): I should play paper (+3 points!)\n   - If they stick with paper (stubborn): I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives me the chance for +3 points if they counter-adapt to rock\n   - After losing twice in a row, rock seems like their logical counter-move\n   - The high reward potential (+3) could significantly improve my -3 deficit\n\n8. Decision: Choose paper to capitalize on their likely switch to rock as a counter to my successful scissors strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - Paper: 5 times (50%), Rock: 3 times (30%), Scissors: 2 times (20%)\n   - Rock frequency is increasing (appeared in last 3 out of 4 rounds)\n\n3. Identify my recent winning streak:\n   - Won last 3 rounds in a row with rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This creates a cycle: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock\n   - I've successfully predicted their counter-adaptations\n\n4. Analyze opponent's likely reaction to this latest loss:\n   - They just lost with rock to my paper (losing 3 points)\n   - They've now been countered successfully 3 times in a row\n   - They might be frustrated and looking to break my predictive pattern\n\n5. Consider their options:\n   - They might expect me to continue the \"cycle\" and play scissors next\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they should play rock (which has been working for them recently)\n   - Or they might return to their historical favorite: paper (50% of all plays)\n   - They might also try scissors to counter an expected paper play\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic choices:\n   - If they play rock (expecting my scissors): I should play paper (+3 points again!)\n   - If they return to paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has shown they adapt by trying to counter my previous winning move\n   - After losing to paper, they might expect me to avoid the high-risk paper play\n   - But they also might expect me to follow the \"cycle\" pattern with scissors\n   - Rock seems like their most logical counter-move against expected scissors\n\n8. Decision: Given their pattern of counter-adaptation and the success of rock in their recent plays, I'll bet they choose rock again. I'll play paper to potentially get another +3 point victory.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Recognize what's actually happening:\n   - The opponent isn't just following patterns\n   - They're successfully predicting MY next move consistently\n   - They seem to understand my decision-making process better than I do\n\n5. Consider a radical approach:\n   - All my \"logical\" choices are being countered\n   - Maybe I need to abandon logic entirely\n   - What if I make a completely random choice?\n\n6. Analyze the opponent's possible expectations:\n   - After losing -3 with rock, they might expect me to avoid rock\n   - They might expect scissors (to counter their paper pattern)\n   - They might expect me to be desperate and go for paper (high reward)\n\n7. Strategic desperation analysis:\n   - I'm down -9 points and in deep trouble\n   - Traditional strategy has completely failed\n   - Maybe the most unpredictable thing is to pick the move that makes the least \"sense\"\n\n8. Decision: I'm going to play scissors because:\n   - It beats paper (their most common move)\n   - It's the opposite of overthinking - just a direct counter to their favorite\n   - At this point, simple and direct might be more unpredictable than complex reasoning\n   - I need ANY win to stop this horrible streak\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
