    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper vs rock has the highest payoff differential (+3/-3), while the other matchups only have +1/-1. This means:\n1. Winning with paper gives the maximum reward\n2. Losing to paper gives the maximum penalty\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry. Many new players default to rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n\nIf they choose rock, I want to choose paper to get the +3 points. If they choose paper (recognizing its high value), I should choose scissors to get +1 and deny them +3. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to get +1.\n\nGiven that new players often start with rock, and paper has the highest reward potential, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They recognize its high-value potential. We've now tied on paper twice, which suggests we're thinking similarly about the optimal play.\n\nSince we both keep choosing paper when we want to maximize value, and they've demonstrated they can think ahead (playing scissors in round 2), I need to consider:\n\n1. Will they stick with paper again, hoping I'll finally switch away from it?\n2. Will they anticipate that I might play scissors to counter their expected paper?\n3. Will they try rock, expecting me to go for paper again?\n\nGiven that we've tied on paper twice now, they might expect me to finally try scissors to beat their paper. If they're thinking this way, they might switch to rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll assume they'll switch away from paper after two ties, so they might actually stick with paper expecting me to play scissors.\n\nThis is a complex decision, but I think after two paper ties, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n- Play rock (expecting me to play scissors)\n- Play paper again (thinking I'll switch to scissors)\n\nIf they play rock, I want paper (+3).

This could mean:\n1. They expected me to not play scissors (thinking I'd avoid the obvious counter)\n2. They're getting confident with paper since it's been working\n3. They thought I'd play rock again or try something else\n4. They're starting to favor paper for its high-value potential\n\nThe fact that they played paper twice in a row (rounds 10 and 11) suggests they might be getting attached to its high reward potential, or they're testing whether I'll consistently counter it.\n\nNow they know I was willing to play the direct counter (scissors to their paper). For the next round, they might:\n- Expect me to play scissors again since it just worked\n- Counter my expected scissors with rock\n- Try a different approach entirely\n- Go back to their more unpredictable strategy\n\nGiven that I just beat their paper with scissors, the most logical response from them would be to play rock to counter scissors if they think I'll repeat it.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll assume they'll counter scissors with rock, so they might play paper expecting me to play rock.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. I think the key is that they just lost after being on a good streak, so they might be thinking more defensively or trying to counter my successful scissors.\n\nI'll play rock to beat their likely scissors-counter, but also to potentially lose to paper if they're still chasing those +3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're clearly thinking on similar strategic levels and often arriving at the same conclusions.\n\nIn the last two rounds:\n- Round 12: We both played rock (defensive/counter thinking)\n- Round 13: We both played scissors (expecting the other to play paper)\n\nThis suggests we're both:\n1. Thinking multiple steps ahead\n2. Considering what the other expects us to do\n3. Sometimes arriving at identical strategic conclusions\n\nFor round 14, after tying twice in a row, they might think:\n- We're too evenly matched and should try something random\n- I'll expect them to break the tie pattern\n- I'll stick with scissors since we just tied on it\n- I'll go for paper for the high value after two defensive/neutral plays\n\nThe double tie might make both of us want to finally get an advantage. Paper offers the biggest reward (+3), but it's also risky (-1 if countered by scissors).\n\nGiven that we just both played scissors (showing we both thought the other would play paper), they might now think I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors repeat. If they think I'll play rock, they should play paper for +3.\n\nBut they might also think I'll go for paper myself after two ties, in which case they'd play scissors.\n\nThis is getting very meta. I think after two ties, we're both looking for an advantage. I'll go with paper for the high-reward potential, accepting the risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This player has shown they can adapt and think strategically, so they'll likely analyze what just happened:\n- I was willing to risk paper after two ties\n- I got the maximum reward\n- They might expect me to either get greedy and try paper again, or expect them to counter with scissors\n\nFor round 15, they're probably thinking:\n- Will I get confident and try paper again for another +3?\n- Will I expect them to play scissors to counter paper and play rock?\n- Will I try something completely different?\n\nGiven that I just got +3 with paper, the most obvious counter-strategy for them is scissors. But they know I know this is obvious. They might think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll be tempted by another +3 and stick with paper despite the risk.\n\nThis player has shown good adaptation skills throughout our game.

They are completely locked into this automatic counter-response:\n\n- My paper \u2192 They play rock (to counter paper)\n- My rock \u2192 They play scissors (to counter rock)  \n- My scissors \u2192 They play paper (to counter scissors)\n- Repeat cycle\n\nThey've become a completely predictable opponent, mechanically responding with whatever beats my previous move. But since I'm anticipating their counter-moves and playing one step ahead, I keep winning.\n\nFor round 20, following the established pattern: I just played scissors, so they should counter with rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat their rock and get another +3 points.\n\nAt this point, this player is either completely stuck in this mental pattern, or they're about to have a breakthrough moment where they realize what's happening. But given the consistency over six rounds, I believe they'll continue the pattern.\n\n[move] (They'll counter my scissors with rock, so I'll play paper for the maximum points) paper\n"
