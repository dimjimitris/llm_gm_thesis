This means:\n1. Winning with paper gives the maximum reward\n2. Losing to paper gives the maximum penalty\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not immediately recognize this payoff asymmetry. Many new players default to rock as it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n\nIf they choose rock, I want to choose paper to get the +3 points. If they choose paper (recognizing its high value), I should choose scissors to get +1 and deny them +3. If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to get +1.\n\nGiven that new players often start with rock, and paper has the highest reward potential, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They recognize its high-value potential. We've now tied on paper twice, which suggests we're thinking similarly about the optimal play.\n\nSince we both keep choosing paper when we want to maximize value, and they've demonstrated they can think ahead (playing scissors in round 2), I need to consider:\n\n1. Will they stick with paper again, hoping I'll finally switch away from it?\n2. Will they anticipate that I might play scissors to counter their expected paper?\n3. Will they try rock, expecting me to go for paper again?\n\nGiven that we've tied on paper twice now, they might expect me to finally try scissors to beat their paper. If they're thinking this way, they might switch to rock to counter my anticipated scissors.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll assume they'll switch away from paper after two ties, so they might actually stick with paper expecting me to play scissors.\n\nThis is a complex decision, but I think after two paper ties, there's a reasonable chance they'll either:\n- Play rock (expecting me to play scissors)\n- Play paper again (thinking I'll switch to scissors)\n\nIf they play rock, I want paper (+3).

For the next round, they might:\n- Expect me to play scissors again since it just worked\n- Counter my expected scissors with rock\n- Try a different approach entirely\n- Go back to their more unpredictable strategy\n\nGiven that I just beat their paper with scissors, the most logical response from them would be to play rock to counter scissors if they think I'll repeat it.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll assume they'll counter scissors with rock, so they might play paper expecting me to play rock.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. I think the key is that they just lost after being on a good streak, so they might be thinking more defensively or trying to counter my successful scissors.\n\nI'll play rock to beat their likely scissors-counter, but also to potentially lose to paper if they're still chasing those +3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

We're clearly thinking on similar strategic levels and often arriving at the same conclusions.\n\nIn the last two rounds:\n- Round 12: We both played rock (defensive/counter thinking)\n- Round 13: We both played scissors (expecting the other to play paper)\n\nThis suggests we're both:\n1. Thinking multiple steps ahead\n2. Considering what the other expects us to do\n3. Sometimes arriving at identical strategic conclusions\n\nFor round 14, after tying twice in a row, they might think:\n- We're too evenly matched and should try something random\n- I'll expect them to break the tie pattern\n- I'll stick with scissors since we just tied on it\n- I'll go for paper for the high value after two defensive/neutral plays\n\nThe double tie might make both of us want to finally get an advantage. Paper offers the biggest reward (+3), but it's also risky (-1 if countered by scissors).\n\nGiven that we just both played scissors (showing we both thought the other would play paper), they might now think I'll play rock to counter their potential scissors repeat. If they think I'll play rock, they should play paper for +3.\n\nBut they might also think I'll go for paper myself after two ties, in which case they'd play scissors.\n\nThis is getting very meta. I think after two ties, we're both looking for an advantage. I'll go with paper for the high-reward potential, accepting the risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This player has shown they can adapt and think strategically, so they'll likely analyze what just happened:\n- I was willing to risk paper after two ties\n- I got the maximum reward\n- They might expect me to either get greedy and try paper again, or expect them to counter with scissors\n\nFor round 15, they're probably thinking:\n- Will I get confident and try paper again for another +3?\n- Will I expect them to play scissors to counter paper and play rock?\n- Will I try something completely different?\n\nGiven that I just got +3 with paper, the most obvious counter-strategy for them is scissors. But they know I know this is obvious. They might think I'll anticipate their scissors and play rock.\n\nHowever, they might also think I'll be tempted by another +3 and stick with paper despite the risk.\n\nThis player has shown good adaptation skills throughout our game.

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper\n   - Paper appears 4 out of 6 times (67%)\n   - They're showing strong consistency with paper as their primary choice\n   - The deviations (rock, scissors) seem to be tactical responses\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's skill level:\n   - They successfully countered my moves in rounds 2, 5, and 6\n   - They seem to be reading my strategy and adapting accordingly\n   - They maintain paper as their base strategy but deviate when tactically advantageous\n\n4. Assess my strategic errors:\n   - I've been overthinking and trying to counter-predict too much\n   - The opponent's fundamental preference for paper is clear\n   - I should focus on their dominant pattern rather than trying to outguess tactical switches\n\n5. Evaluate current situation:\n   - I'm down -4 points and need to recover\n   - The opponent has returned to paper after their tactical scissors play\n   - Given their 67% paper rate, scissors remains the statistically best choice\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Stop overthinking the opponent's tactical deviations\n   - Focus on their dominant pattern: paper\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives +1 point\n   - Even though the reward is smaller, consistency against their main strategy is key\n\n7. Decision: Choose scissors to exploit their clear preference for paper, focusing on their dominant pattern rather than trying to predict tactical switches.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - Paper: 4 times, Rock: 2 times, Scissors: 1 time\n   - Notice: Rock appeared in rounds 2 and 7 - both times I played scissors\n   - This suggests they may be counter-playing my moves specifically\n\n3. Identify the key insight:\n   - When I play scissors, opponent plays rock (rounds 2, 4, 7)\n   - In round 4 they played paper and I won, but rounds 2 and 7 they played rock\n   - They seem to have learned to counter scissors with rock\n\n4. Examine opponent's counter-strategy:\n   - Round 5: I played paper, they played scissors (countered)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, they played paper (countered) \n   - Round 7: I played scissors, they played rock (countered)\n   - They're actively reading and countering my moves\n\n5. Strategic recalibration:\n   - The opponent is not just following patterns - they're adapting to MY moves\n   - I need to think about what they expect me to play next\n   - Given my recent losses, they might expect me to try paper for the high reward\n   - Or they might expect me to avoid scissors since it's been countered twice\n\n6. Decision logic:\n   - If they expect me to play paper (for +3 recovery), they'll play scissors\n   - If they expect me to avoid scissors, they might go back to paper\n   - Rock could be a good choice: beats scissors, loses to paper moderately\n   - Given their tendency to counter-adapt, rock might be unexpected\n\n7. Decision: Choose rock as a defensive play that beats scissors and gives me a chance if they return to their paper preference or expect me to avoid rock after last round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Notice the recent trend:\n   - Last two rounds: I won with rock vs scissors, then scissors vs paper\n   - The opponent returned to paper after losing with scissors\n   - This confirms their tendency to revert to paper after tactical moves fail\n\n4. Analyze opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors (again - like round 4)\n   - They've now lost with paper to scissors twice\n   - They might finally adapt and avoid paper, or switch to rock to counter scissors\n\n5. Consider their psychological state:\n   - Two consecutive losses might make them more desperate/reactive\n   - They might try rock (which worked in rounds 2 and 7 against my scissors)\n   - Or they might try scissors to counter expected paper (if they think I'll go for +3)\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock (likely counter to my recent scissors success): I should play paper (+3 points!)\n   - If they stick with paper (stubborn): I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper gives me the chance for +3 points if they counter-adapt to rock\n   - After losing twice in a row, rock seems like their logical counter-move\n   - The high reward potential (+3) could significantly improve my -3 deficit\n\n8.

Consider their options:\n   - They might expect me to continue the \"cycle\" and play scissors next\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they should play rock (which has been working for them recently)\n   - Or they might return to their historical favorite: paper (50% of all plays)\n   - They might also try scissors to counter an expected paper play\n\n6.

Identify the key insight:\n   - After ties in rounds 12-13, they went for paper (their historical favorite)\n   - Paper vs rock gives them the maximum +3 advantage\n   - They're balancing pattern recognition with maximum damage potential\n\n5. Analyze their likely next move:\n   - They just scored +3 points with paper\n   - They might stick with paper since it's working and is their most common choice\n   - Or they might expect me to counter paper with scissors and switch accordingly\n\n6. Consider my current situation:\n   - I'm down -4 points and need to recover\n   - I need to start making successful predictions\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives +1 point, which I need\n\n7. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - If they stick with paper (43% historical rate): Scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors loses (-1 point)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Scissors ties (0 points)\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Their paper preference is clear (43% overall, just used successfully)\n   - After a big win, players often stick with what worked\n   - Scissors is the logical counter to their most probable move\n   - I need positive points, and this gives me the best chance\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock\n   - Paper: 6 times (40%), Rock: 5 times (33%), Scissors: 4 times (27%)\n   - Rock frequency is increasing significantly\n\n3. Notice the alarming trend:\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - The opponent is successfully counter-predicting my moves\n   - They seem to be reading my strategy and adapting faster than I am\n\n4. Identify the opponent's counter-pattern:\n   - When I play scissors, they often counter with rock (rounds 2, 7, 15)\n   - When I play rock, they counter with paper (rounds 6, 14)\n   - They're specifically targeting my moves with their optimal counters\n\n5. Realize my strategic error:\n   - I've been overthinking and trying to predict their patterns\n   - Meanwhile, they're focusing on countering MY patterns\n   - I need to break my own predictability, not just predict theirs\n\n6. Assess what they might expect from me:\n   - After losing with scissors twice recently, they might expect me to avoid it\n   - They might expect me to try paper (for the +3 recovery potential)\n   - Or they might expect rock as a \"safe\" choice\n\n7. Strategic recalibration:\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n   - Given my recent scissors losses, paper might be unexpected\n   - Paper also offers the highest reward (+3) if they choose rock\n   - They've been using rock more frequently (33% and rising)\n\n8. Decision: Play paper because:\n   - It's less predictable given my recent scissors pattern\n   - It offers maximum reward against their increasing rock usage\n   - I desperately need a high-value win to recover from -5 points\n\n[move] Paper\n"
