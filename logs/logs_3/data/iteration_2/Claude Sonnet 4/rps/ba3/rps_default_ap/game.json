My total score is now +9 points (+6 + 3).\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: scissors\n- Round 2: scissors  \n- Round 3: paper\n- Round 4: scissors\n- Round 5: scissors\n- Round 6-10: paper (5 times)\n- Round 11-12: scissors (2 times)\n- Round 13-15: paper (3 times)\n- Round 16-22: rock (7 times)\n\nThis is absolutely incredible! Seven consecutive rock plays - they've completely shattered their previous maximum streak. This level of persistence is remarkable and shows they can be extremely stubborn with their chosen strategy.\n\nHowever, looking at their rock phase performance:\n- Won: rounds 19, 21 (2 wins)\n- Lost: rounds 17, 18, 20, 22 (4 losses to my paper)\n\nThey're now losing more often than winning with rock, yet they continue. This suggests either:\n1. Extreme commitment to their strategy\n2. They haven't fully recognized the pattern\n3. They're waiting for me to switch away from paper\n\nIf they stick with rock (which seems likely given this incredible streak), paper beats it (+3 points).\nIf they finally switch to paper, scissors beats it (+1 points).\nIf they switch to scissors, rock beats it (+1 points).\n\nGiven their unprecedented 7-game rock streak, I think they might continue. The potential +3 points is too good to pass up.\n\n[move] paper",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
