    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Even after taking two -3 penalties with rock (rounds 13 and 15), they might continue with rock, just like they continued with paper despite multiple losses.\n\nHowever, taking two maximum penalties (-3 each) might finally make them switch.

The pattern is crystal clear:\n- Early scissors phase\n- 5-round paper phase  \n- Now 5-round rock phase (and counting)\n\nGiven their extreme persistence, even after three -3 penalties, I think they'll likely continue with rock. They seem almost programmed to stick with a strategy regardless of results.\n\nHowever, five rounds might be their limit - they switched away from paper after exactly 5 rounds. If they follow the same pattern, they might finally switch now.\n\nBut the safer bet based on their behavior is that they'll try rock one more time. I'll continue with paper.\n\n[move] Paper"
