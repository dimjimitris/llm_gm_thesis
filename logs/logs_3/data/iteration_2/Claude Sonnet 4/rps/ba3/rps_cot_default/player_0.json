    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose rock as a default/safe choice (common beginner tendency)\n   - Make random moves without strategy\n   - Not yet recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum points (+3), and rock is often chosen by new players, paper appears to be the optimal choice.\n\n5. Consider risk: Even if opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case is losing 1 point (if they choose scissors), but the potential gain of 3 points makes this a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to maximize expected value against a likely rock choice from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They chose paper, possibly for the same strategic reason I did\n   - They might stick with paper again, thinking it's the \"best\" move\n   - Or they might try to counter-adapt, expecting me to play paper again\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a potential repeat paper play:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: Only scissors beats paper\n   - Scissors vs paper gives me +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - This is better than another tie at 0 points\n\n4. Consider the meta-game:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper, they might choose scissors\n   - If they choose scissors and I choose rock, I lose 1 point\n   - But if they choose scissors and I also choose scissors, it's a tie\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 if they repeat paper)\n   - Scissors loses to rock (-1 if they switch to rock)\n   - Scissors ties with scissors (0 if they also adapt)\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's latest sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - They broke their own alternating pattern to counter me\n   - This suggests they're adaptively strategic, not following rigid patterns\n\n4. Reassess opponent's skill level:\n   - They've consistently countered my moves\n   - Able to establish patterns then break them strategically\n   - May be reading my decision-making process\n\n5. Consider what they might expect now:\n   - After losing -3 to their paper, they might expect me to play scissors (to counter paper)\n   - Or they might expect me to go back to paper (my most successful move)\n   - They could anticipate my frustration and predict my next move\n\n6. Evaluate my options with fresh perspective:\n   - Scissors: +1 vs paper, -1 vs rock, 0 vs scissors\n   - Paper: +3 vs rock, -1 vs scissors, 0 vs paper  \n   - Rock: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs paper, 0 vs rock\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to stop being predictable\n   - Scissors counters their recent winning paper\n   - If they expect me to repeat rock or go with paper, scissors might surprise them\n   - Small gain is better than another big loss\n\n[move] scissors\n"
