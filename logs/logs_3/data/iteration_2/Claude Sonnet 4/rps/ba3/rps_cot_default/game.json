This suggests they're not following a simple rotation pattern, but rather making strategic decisions.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My total score: 0 points \n- We've now had two ties\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\nThe fact that we both played scissors suggests we might be thinking similarly. My opponent could be:\n1. Testing if I'll repeat scissors (expecting them to counter with rock)\n2. Genuinely uncertain and sticking with their last move\n3. Trying to establish a new pattern\n\nSince we just tied with scissors, there are a few possibilities:\n- They might expect me to switch away from scissors\n- They could play rock expecting me to repeat scissors\n- They might go for paper to try for the high-value win, expecting me to play rock\n\nGiven that we've both shown tactical thinking and just tied, I think they'll likely try to counter a potential scissors repeat from me by playing rock. However, they might also think I'll switch to rock (to beat scissors), so they could play paper for the +3.\n\nI'll go with paper - it beats rock (if they counter my scissors) and gives maximum value if correct.\n\n[move] (We both played scissors, so my opponent might expect me to switch or they might play rock to counter a scissors repeat.

We both went for paper again, which suggests we're both recognizing its high value and thinking at similar strategic levels.\n\nThe pattern shows my opponent is adaptable and strategic:\n- Started with high-value paper\n- Switched tactically to rock when expecting scissors\n- Repeated scissors (possibly testing)\n- Now back to paper (going for value)\n\nSince we just tied with paper again, my opponent might:\n1. Think I'll stick with paper (the high-value move) and counter with scissors\n2. Expect me to switch away from paper and play rock themselves\n3. Try to break the tie pattern by choosing something different\n\nGiven that we've both shown we value paper's +3 potential, they might anticipate I'll stay with it and counter with scissors.

The pattern shows we're both:\n1. Recognizing the same strategic opportunities\n2. Making similar meta-game calculations\n3. Possibly getting trapped in parallel thinking\n\nMy opponent's sequence shows tactical awareness but we keep converging on the same moves. This suggests we might both be overthinking at similar levels.\n\nAt this point, I need to break out of this parallel thinking pattern. We're both clearly strategic players, but our similar reasoning is leading to constant ties.\n\n**Breaking the Pattern:**\nInstead of trying to predict what they'll do based on complex meta-reasoning (which has led to ties), I should consider:\n- They might be experiencing the same frustration with ties\n- They could try to go for the high-value paper play again\n- Or they might try scissors, thinking I'll go for paper\n\nGiven our tendency to think alike, and that we just both played rock, they might expect me to switch to paper (for the value) and counter with scissors. But they might also think I'll expect that and play rock again.\n\nI'll go with scissors - it counters paper if they go for value, and breaks our mirroring pattern.\n\n[move] (We're thinking too similarly and getting constant ties.
