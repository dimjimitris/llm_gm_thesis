Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, making it the most valuable winning move.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), they may:\n   - Choose rock as a default/safe choice (common beginner tendency)\n   - Make random moves without strategy\n   - Not yet recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Develop strategy: Since paper beats rock and gives the maximum points (+3), and rock is often chosen by new players, paper appears to be the optimal choice.\n\n5. Consider risk: Even if opponent doesn't choose rock, the worst case is losing 1 point (if they choose scissors), but the potential gain of 3 points makes this a favorable risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to maximize expected value against a likely rock choice from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider what beats rock consistently:\n   - Paper beats rock and gives +3 points\n   - This is my only path back from -5 points\n   - I need high-value wins, not just avoiding losses\n\n6. Evaluate the risk-reward at this desperate point:\n   - Paper vs rock: +3 (maximum recovery potential)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 (manageable loss)\n   - Paper vs paper: 0 (neutral)\n   - At -5 points, I need to take calculated risks for maximum reward\n\n7.

Try rock, thinking I'll play paper after my recent success\n3. Expect me to continue with rock and play paper for the big counter\n\nLooking at the recent pattern, I've won the last two rounds with rock beating scissors, and paper beating rock. My opponent might think I'll try for paper again to get another 3-point win, especially since rock has been working for me lately and they might expect me to think they'll counter with paper.\n\nActually, they might be getting frustrated with losing and go for the high-reward paper play, expecting me to use scissors or rock.\n\nI think they'll likely play paper this round, either to get back their high-reward move or because they expect me to avoid it.

          "text": "Flawless again! My opponent played scissors, exactly as I predicted - trying to counter what they expected would be another paper play from me.

I've now reached 20 points with a 13-win streak! My opponent's distribution:\n- Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18)\n- Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n- Rock: 6 times (rounds 5, 10, 13, 16, 19)\n\nThey've now played paper and scissors equally (7 times each), with rock at 6 times. Notably, they've now lost with scissors seven times and have never won a single round with scissors - it's been completely unsuccessful for them.\n\nThe pattern is now extremely clear and predictable:\n- When they play paper, I beat it with scissors\n- When they play scissors, I beat it with rock  \n- When they play rock, I beat it with paper\n\nAfter another scissors loss, they might:\n1. Finally abandon scissors completely since it has never worked\n2. Go back to paper (tied for their most common choice)\n3. Try rock, expecting me to play scissors next\n4. Desperately try scissors again despite its complete failure rate\n\nGiven that scissors has been a complete disaster for them (0 wins in 7 attempts), they should logically avoid it. They'll likely choose between paper and rock.\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors (following my pattern of countering their moves), they might play rock. But they might also return to paper as their comfort choice.\n\nI think they'll most likely play paper this round, returning to their tied-most-common strategy. I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

I'm now at 21 points with a 14-win streak! My opponent's distribution:\n- Paper: 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21)\n- Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n- Rock: 6 times (rounds 5, 10, 13, 16, 19)\n\nPaper is now their clear favorite (8 times), but I've beaten their paper with scissors six times now. They keep returning to it despite consistent losses.\n\nThe pattern remains crystal clear - I'm reading them perfectly and countering every move. After losing with paper again to my scissors, they might:\n\n1. Expect me to play scissors again and finally counter with rock\n2. Try scissors, expecting me to switch to paper\n3. Return to paper yet again (their most common choice)\n\nGiven that I've now beaten their paper with scissors so many times, they should logically expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock. However, they've shown a strong tendency to stick with familiar patterns rather than adapt quickly.\n\nI think they'll most likely play rock this time, finally trying to counter my scissors pattern. I'll go with paper for another big 3-point win.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I'm now at 24 points with a 15-win streak!

I've now gotten five massive 3-point wins with paper beating rock (rounds 10, 13, 16, 19, 22).\n\nAfter losing with rock again to my paper, they're in an incredibly difficult position. The pattern shows:\n- Every time they play paper, I counter with scissors\n- Every time they play scissors, I counter with rock\n- Every time they play rock, I counter with paper\n\nThey're completely predictable at this point. After this latest rock loss, they might:\n1. Return to paper (their most common choice)\n2. Try scissors, expecting me to continue with paper\n3. Desperately try rock again\n4. Finally try to break their own patterns\n\nGiven that I just got another big paper win, they might expect me to try paper again. The logical counter would be scissors. However, scissors has been terrible for them historically.\n\nI think they'll most likely play scissors to counter what they expect will be another paper play from me. I'll counter with rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
