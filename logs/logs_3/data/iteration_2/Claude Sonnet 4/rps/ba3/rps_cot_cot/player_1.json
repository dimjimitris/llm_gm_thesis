    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Review round 1 results:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points each)\n   - This suggests the opponent may also be thinking strategically about the high payoff for paper beating rock\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose paper, showing they understand the payoff structure\n   - They may have had similar reasoning to mine about paper's high reward potential\n   - This opponent might not be as \"fresh\" as initially suggested, or they're learning quickly\n\n3. Analyze current situation:\n   - If opponent sticks with paper again, I need a different move\n   - Scissors beats paper for +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to play scissors), I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should play rock\n\n4.

Risk assessment:\n   - Paper vs rock: +3 points (best case)\n   - Paper vs scissors: -1 points (manageable loss)\n   - Paper vs paper: 0 points (neutral)\n\n6.

Review the game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Current score: -1 points\n\n2. Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Started with paper (strategic thinking)\n   - Switched to scissors in round 2 (correctly anticipated I might stick with paper)\n   - This shows the opponent is adapting and thinking ahead\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They saw I played paper twice\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from paper\n   - If they think I'll play rock or scissors, they have options\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: -3 points (big loss)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: -1 point\n\n5. Think about opponent's next move:\n   - They successfully countered my paper with scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n   - If they anticipate rock, they might play paper for the big +3 reward\n   - Alternatively, they might play rock expecting me to play scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing scissors could work if they choose paper again\n   - Playing rock is risky due to the -3 penalty if they play paper\n   - The opponent seems to be one step ahead, so I should consider what they least expect\n\n7. Final reasoning: Since they've shown strategic thinking and successfully adapted, I'll play scissors. If they play paper (going for the high reward), I win +1. If they play rock, I only lose -1.\n\n[move] (Switching to scissors to counter paper, as the opponent may expect me to play rock and respond with paper for the high reward) scissors"
