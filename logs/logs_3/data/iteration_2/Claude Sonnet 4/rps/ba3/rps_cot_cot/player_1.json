    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - Playing paper has the highest potential reward but also highest potential penalty\n   - Playing rock is safer against paper (only -3) but vulnerable to paper\n   - Playing scissors is risky against rock but good against paper\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems strong/aggressive\n   - This makes paper an attractive choice for maximum points\n   - However, if they think one level ahead, they might choose paper to beat expected rock\n\n5. First move strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round and I have no information about opponent patterns\n   - Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio if opponent chooses rock (common for beginners)\n   - Even if wrong, I learn about their tendencies for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum 3 points if they choose the beginner-friendly rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze round 1 results:\n   - Both players chose paper\n   - This suggests the opponent might also be thinking strategically (not a complete beginner)\n   - They may have had similar reasoning about rock being common for new players\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely thought process:\n   - They chose paper, possibly expecting me to play rock\n   - This shows they're thinking at least one level ahead\n   - They might expect me to switch strategies after the tie\n\n3. Evaluate my options for round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 points)\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper): I should play rock (+1 points)\n\n4. Consider psychological factors:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - They might think I'll change from paper\n   - Rock is a common \"safe\" choice after uncertainty\n   - Scissors would directly counter paper if they think I'll repeat\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially\n   - They're likely to anticipate I might change strategies\n   - Rock seems like a reasonable prediction for their next move\n   - Playing paper again gives me the best payoff (+3) if they choose rock\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again, betting that they'll switch to rock as a \"safe\" choice after the tie.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - If they play paper again: scissors gives me +1 points\n   - If they finally switch to rock: paper gives me +3 points  \n   - If they switch to scissors: rock gives me +1 points\n\n4. Consider probability based on behavior:\n   - Two identical moves suggests either a fixed strategy or extreme stubbornness\n   - Most players would vary their moves after two ties\n   - But the high payoff from paper-beats-rock might keep them committed\n   - The pattern is so strong that they're likely to continue it\n\n5.

Identify opponent's counter-strategy pattern:\n   - They're successfully predicting my moves after their wins\n   - Round 7: After I won with scissors (round 6), they played scissors when I switched to paper\n   - Round 9: After they lost with rock (round 8), they played paper when I switched to rock\n   - Round 10: After they won with paper (round 9), they played rock when I played scissors\n   - They're reading my responses to wins/losses very well\n\n3. Analyze their prediction method:\n   - When they win big, they seem to expect me to counter their winning move\n   - When I win, they expect me to either repeat or switch predictably\n   - They just won with rock, so they might expect me to play paper (to beat rock)\n   - Or they might expect me to play rock (copying their winning move)\n\n4. Consider the meta-game:\n   - I'm down -4 points and need to start winning\n   - They've been out-predicting me consistently\n   - I need to break their prediction pattern\n   - Maybe I should think about what they DON'T expect\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They just played rock and won\n   - If they think I'll play paper (to counter rock), they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll play rock (copying success), they might play paper\n   - But they might also return to their paper preference since it's been successful\n   - Playing paper covers two scenarios: beats rock if they repeat, ties if they also play paper\n   - Most importantly, it avoids the big -3 loss that has hurt me twice\n\nFinal decision: Play paper - it either ties with their preferred paper or beats rock if they repeat, while avoiding catastrophic losses.\n\n[move] paper"

Identify opponent's superior strategy:\n   - They're playing a sophisticated counter-prediction game\n   - After winning: they predict what I'll do to counter their winning move\n   - After losing: they adapt to what they think I'll switch to\n   - They've correctly predicted my responses in rounds 7, 9, 10, and 11\n   - I've only won when I did something unexpected (round 6 and 8)\n\n3. Find patterns in my wins:\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I won)\n   - Round 8: I stayed with paper after losing (unexpected), they played rock (I won)\n   - Both wins came when I did something that broke their prediction model\n\n4. Analyze what they might expect now:\n   - They just won with scissors\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to counter scissors)\n   - Or they might expect me to play scissors (copying their winning move)\n   - They're less likely to expect me to play paper again after it just lost\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - I need to stop being predictable\n   - My previous pattern has been to switch after losses and sometimes repeat after wins\n   - They've been reading this successfully\n   - Playing rock seems most obvious (counters their winning scissors)\n   - But playing scissors might be unexpected since it just beat me\n   - However, rock is the safest choice - even if wrong, it only loses -1 to paper, not -3\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter potential repeated scissors, and because it's the safest option that avoids big losses.\n\n[move] rock"

Consider a completely different approach:\n   - Stop trying to be logical or strategic\n   - Break my own patterns completely\n   - Do something genuinely random or unexpected\n   - Focus on what they CAN'T predict rather than what makes sense\n\n5.
