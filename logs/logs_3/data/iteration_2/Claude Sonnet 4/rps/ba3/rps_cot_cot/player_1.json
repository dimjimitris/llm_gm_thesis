    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. I notice that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, compared to rock and scissors which only give +1 when they win.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new), they may not have developed a strategy yet and could choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices.\n\n4. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option mentioned and feels \"strong.\"\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I want to choose paper to get the maximum +3 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, the worst case scenario is:\n   - If they choose paper: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose scissors: I lose 1 point\n   \n7. The risk-reward analysis favors paper since the potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to maximize expected value, especially against a fresh player who may default to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The fact that my opponent also chose paper suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine - recognizing that paper gives the highest reward (+3 points).\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest potential reward\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n4. If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to win +1 point.\n\n5. If they think I'll stick with paper and choose scissors to counter me, then I should choose rock to beat their scissors for +1 point.\n\n6. If they choose rock (thinking I might switch to rock), then I should stick with paper for +3 points.\n\n7. Given that this opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing paper initially, they're likely considering the same meta-game. The most probable scenarios are:\n   - They stick with paper (I should choose scissors)\n   - They switch to scissors expecting me to stick with paper (I should choose rock)\n\n8. Between these two options, I'll go with scissors because if they're thinking strategically about the high-value paper move, they might stick with it.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: Both chose scissors (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. This opponent is showing similar strategic thinking to me - they're making the same moves I am, which suggests they're using similar logic.\n\n3. The sequence so far has been: paper \u2192 scissors. Following rock-paper-scissors order, the next logical move in sequence would be rock.\n\n4. However, if my opponent is thinking the same way I am, they might also expect rock next, leading to another tie.\n\n5. I need to break this pattern of ties. Let me consider what they might be thinking:\n   - They might continue the sequence and choose rock\n   - They might try to break the pattern by going back to paper (the high-value move)\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n6. Given that we've had two ties, they might want to avoid rock (expecting me to choose rock) and go back to paper for the +3 point potential.\n\n7. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors to win +1 point.\n\n8. If they choose rock (following the sequence), I should choose paper to win +3 points.\n\n9. The higher expected value comes from choosing paper (potential +3 vs scissors' potential +1), and it also counters the sequence-following behavior.\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to either get +3 points if they choose rock, or tie if they also think to choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent broke the tie pattern by choosing scissors when I chose paper. This suggests they anticipated I might choose paper again.\n\n3. Current score: I have -1 points total. I need to recover and start winning.\n\n4. The opponent showed they can predict my moves - they correctly anticipated I'd return to paper in round 3.\n\n5. Looking at their sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors. They repeated scissors, which worked against my paper.\n\n6. Now I need to think about what they'll do in round 4:\n   - They might stick with scissors since it just worked\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll now choose rock to counter scissors\n   - They might go to rock to complete a cycle\n\n7. If they stick with scissors, I should choose rock to win +1 point.\n\n8. If they switch to rock (thinking I'll choose rock), then they'd expect a tie, but I could choose paper for +3 points.\n\n9.

My opponent is consistently staying one step ahead of my predictions. They're either:\n   - Very good at reading my strategy\n   - Following a pattern I haven't recognized yet\n   - Adapting well to counter my moves\n\n5.

Given they just won big with paper (-3 points to me), they might try paper again for another high-value win.\n\nFinal decision: Choose scissors to counter paper, since they just won big with paper and might repeat it.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
