Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the recent pattern:\n   - My prediction was correct again - opponent played rock expecting my scissors\n   - We're both successfully predicting each other's counter-strategies\n   - The opponent's sequence: paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock\n\n3. Notice opponent's adaptation pattern:\n   - The opponent seems to cycle through moves but also responds to what they think I'll do\n   - They just lost -3 points after playing rock\n   - This is their second maximum loss (-3 points)\n\n4. Consider opponent's psychology:\n   - They just suffered another -3 point loss\n   - They might be more cautious about going for high-value plays\n   - They could expect me to play scissors (to counter paper since I just won with paper)\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper since it's been successful\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting my paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n6. Consider the meta-level thinking:\n   - I just won with paper beating their rock\n   - They might expect me to expect them to play scissors (to counter paper)\n   - This could lead them to play paper instead, thinking I'll play rock\n   - But they might also just play scissors directly to counter my winning paper\n\n7.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - The opponent played rock, completing the paper-scissors-rock sequence\n   - They chose the \"obvious\" next move while I tried to overthink it\n   - Sometimes the simplest, most logical choice is actually what happens\n\n3. Recognize a key insight:\n   - I've been overcomplicating my strategy since my winning streak ended\n   - The opponent might not always be thinking at the complex level I assume\n   - Sometimes they just make straightforward, logical moves\n\n4. Consider the opponent's current position:\n   - They just won with rock after two ties\n   - They completed what seemed like a natural sequence: paper, scissors, rock\n   - They might continue with simple logic or try something different\n\n5. Evaluate my approach going forward:\n   - I need to balance between simple logic and strategic thinking\n   - Not every move needs to be a complex counter-prediction\n   - The opponent just used rock successfully\n\n6. Consider the opponent's next likely move:\n   - They just won with rock and might expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they expect paper from me, they might play scissors\n   - Or they might stick with rock if they think it's working\n   - Or they could try paper for the high-value play\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just won with rock and may expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they expect paper, they'll likely play scissors\n   - But they might also try paper themselves for the +3 potential\n   - I'll play rock - it beats scissors (if they counter my expected paper) and only loses -3 to paper\n\n[move] (Opponent just won with rock and may expect me to counter with paper, so they might play scissors - playing rock to beat scissors) rock"

Analyze my recent poor performance:\n   - I've now lost 5 of the last 7 rounds (with 2 ties)\n   - I've gone from +8 points to -1 points\n   - My complex strategic thinking has backfired repeatedly\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's recent success pattern:\n   - Round 18: rock (beat my scissors)\n   - Round 19: paper (beat my rock for maximum points)\n   - They're successfully anticipating my moves and going for high-value plays\n\n4. Consider what's happening strategically:\n   - The opponent just scored +3 points with paper\n   - They've now beaten me with both rock and paper recently\n   - They might expect me to counter their paper with scissors\n\n5. Evaluate the current dynamics:\n   - I keep trying to predict what they'll do based on complex reasoning\n   - They seem to be making moves that counter my predictions effectively\n   - Maybe I should focus on what gives me the best chance regardless of prediction\n\n6. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting me to counter their paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just won big with paper and likely expects me to counter with scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock to counter it\n   - But they've been aggressive about going for high-value plays\n   - I'll play scissors - if they play paper again (going for another +3), I win; if they play rock (countering my expected scissors), I lose only -1\n\n[move] (Opponent won big with paper and may either repeat for another high-value play or expect my scissors counter with rock - playing scissors covers the paper repeat scenario) scissors"

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - This is now the third tie in recent rounds (16, 17, 20)\n   - We both chose scissors this time\n   - The opponent and I are occasionally thinking alike again\n\n3. Notice the recent sequence:\n   - We both played scissors in rounds 17 and 20\n   - There were other moves in between, but scissors seems to be a common choice\n   - The opponent might be expecting this pattern\n\n4. Consider what just happened:\n   - I played scissors expecting they might repeat paper or counter with rock\n   - They also played scissors, possibly with similar reasoning\n   - This suggests we're both being somewhat predictable in our logic\n\n5. Evaluate the current state:\n   - I'm back to -1 points, where I was after round 6\n   - My complex strategies haven't been working well\n   - The opponent has been effective at countering my moves\n\n6. Consider simplifying my approach:\n   - Instead of trying to predict complex counter-strategies, focus on fundamentals\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins\n   - Rock and scissors both give +1 when they win\n   - Going for the high-value play might be worth the risk\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - We just tied with scissors, and the opponent might expect me to switch\n   - They could expect rock (to beat scissors) or paper (for high value)\n   - If they expect rock from me, they might play paper for +3\n   - I'll take a risk and play scissors - if they go for paper (high value), I win; if they play rock (expecting my rock), I lose -1\n\n[move] (After tie with scissors, opponent might expect me to switch to rock and could play paper for high value - staying with scissors to counter potential paper) scissors"

Recognize the stark pattern:\n   - I had a perfect 5-game winning streak when I could predict the opponent's counter-pattern\n   - Since they adapted (round 13), I've performed terribly: 1 win, 6 losses, 3 ties\n   - My score has dropped from +8 to -2 points\n\n3. Analyze what's been going wrong:\n   - I keep trying to predict what the opponent will do based on complex meta-reasoning\n   - The opponent seems to be successfully countering my predictions\n   - My overthinking is clearly not working\n\n4. Consider a fundamental shift in strategy:\n   - Instead of trying to predict the opponent's moves, focus on my own optimal play\n   - Stop trying to think about what they think I'll do\n   - Make moves based on simple, sound reasoning\n\n5. Evaluate the basic game theory:\n   - Paper has the highest payoff (+3) but also the highest risk (-1 when countered)\n   - Rock and scissors have moderate payoff (+1) and moderate risk (-1 or -3)\n   - In a truly random game, all moves have equal expected value\n\n6. Consider the opponent's recent behavior:\n   - They just played rock, beating my scissors\n   - They've been quite successful at countering my moves\n   - They might expect me to continue overthinking\n\n7.

Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm behind at -2 points and need to score to catch up\n   - Ties don't help me close the gap\n   - I need wins, particularly high-value wins\n\n5.
