    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and develop a strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper vs rock has the highest reward/penalty (\u00b13 points)\n   - Rock vs scissors and scissors vs paper have lower rewards/penalties (\u00b11 point)\n\n3. Consider optimal strategy:\n   - Paper gives the highest potential reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - If I expect the opponent to play rock (common first move), paper would be optimal\n   - If I expect scissors, rock would be better\n   - If I expect paper, scissors would be better\n\n4. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as their first move\n   - Rock is psychologically the most \"aggressive\" choice beginners make\n   - Playing paper would maximize my expected value against this tendency\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing paper: High reward if opponent plays rock, moderate loss if scissors\n   - The 3-point swing makes paper attractive against likely rock play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to capitalize on the high payoff and the likelihood that a fresh player will choose rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - Both players chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points)\n   - This means the other player also recognized paper's high-value potential\n   - The opponent may not be as \"fresh\" as initially expected\n\n2. Consider what this reveals about my opponent:\n   - They chose paper on their first move, showing strategic awareness\n   - They understand the payoff structure (paper beats rock for +3)\n   - They might continue with paper or switch strategies\n\n3. Analyze possible opponent responses for round 2:\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to play paper again): They'd win big, so this is risky for me to assume\n   - If they switch to scissors (expecting me to stick with paper): I should play rock\n\n4. Consider mixed strategy benefits:\n   - Playing scissors beats paper (+1) and loses to rock (-1)\n   - Playing rock beats scissors (+1) and loses big to paper (-3)\n   - Playing paper again risks another tie or losing to scissors\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors seems optimal: beats paper for +1, modest loss to rock for -1\n   - Avoid rock due to the high penalty risk (-3) if they play paper again\n   - Since they showed strategic thinking with paper choice, scissors counters that\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper strategy while minimizing downside risk.\n\n[move] scissors"

Review the game history:\n   - Round 1: Both played paper (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Current score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - They've played paper twice in a row\n   - This could indicate they're either:\n     a) Sticking to the high-value move consistently\n     b) Haven't adapted their strategy yet\n     c) Planning to switch now that their pattern was exploited\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely thoughts:\n   - They just lost to my scissors when they played paper\n   - They might switch to rock to counter scissors (expecting me to repeat)\n   - Or they might try scissors themselves to counter potential paper from me\n   - Less likely they'll play paper a third time after being beaten\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they switch to rock (to beat scissors): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors (mimicking my winning move): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they stick with paper: I should play scissors again (+1 point)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers highest reward (+3) if they play rock\n   - Rock offers safety against scissors with moderate reward (+1)\n   - Scissors repeats last round's success but might be predictable\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent is likely to counter my previous winning move (scissors)\n   - Rock is the natural counter to scissors\n   - Playing paper would capitalize on this expected adjustment\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to exploit their likely switch to rock while going for the maximum 3-point reward.\n\n[move] paper"
