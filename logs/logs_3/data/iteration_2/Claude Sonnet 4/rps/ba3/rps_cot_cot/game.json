Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Started with paper (strategic thinking)\n   - Switched to scissors in round 2 (correctly anticipated I might stick with paper)\n   - This shows the opponent is adapting and thinking ahead\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely reasoning:\n   - They saw I played paper twice\n   - They might expect me to finally switch away from paper\n   - If they think I'll play rock or scissors, they have options\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play paper: -3 points (big loss)\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: +1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: -1 point\n\n5. Think about opponent's next move:\n   - They successfully countered my paper with scissors\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (to beat scissors)\n   - If they anticipate rock, they might play paper for the big +3 reward\n   - Alternatively, they might play rock expecting me to play scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing scissors could work if they choose paper again\n   - Playing rock is risky due to the -3 penalty if they play paper\n   - The opponent seems to be one step ahead, so I should consider what they least expect\n\n7. Final reasoning: Since they've shown strategic thinking and successfully adapted, I'll play scissors. If they play paper (going for the high reward), I win +1. If they play rock, I only lose -1.\n\n[move] (Switching to scissors to counter paper, as the opponent may expect me to play rock and respond with paper for the high reward) scissors",
