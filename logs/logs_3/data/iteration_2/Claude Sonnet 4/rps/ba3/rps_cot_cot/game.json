Examine opponent's predictable behavior:\n   - Round 7: They played paper (going for high value)\n   - Round 8: They played paper again (got the +3 win)\n   - Round 9: They played rock (expecting my scissors counter)\n   - Round 10: They played scissors (countering my winning paper from round 9)\n\n4. Identify the pattern:\n   - The opponent is very reactive - they consistently try to counter my previous successful move\n   - I just won with rock beating their scissors\n   - Following this pattern, they will likely play paper to counter rock\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays paper (to counter my rock): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n6.

Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (expecting me to counter their paper): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just won big with paper and likely expects me to counter with scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock to counter it\n   - But they've been aggressive about going for high-value plays\n   - I'll play scissors - if they play paper again (going for another +3), I win; if they play rock (countering my expected scissors), I lose only -1\n\n[move] (Opponent won big with paper and may either repeat for another high-value play or expect my scissors counter with rock - playing scissors covers the paper repeat scenario) scissors"

Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - This is now the third tie in recent rounds (16, 17, 20)\n   - We both chose scissors this time\n   - The opponent and I are occasionally thinking alike again\n\n3. Notice the recent sequence:\n   - We both played scissors in rounds 17 and 20\n   - There were other moves in between, but scissors seems to be a common choice\n   - The opponent might be expecting this pattern\n\n4. Consider what just happened:\n   - I played scissors expecting they might repeat paper or counter with rock\n   - They also played scissors, possibly with similar reasoning\n   - This suggests we're both being somewhat predictable in our logic\n\n5.

Make strategic decision:\n   - The opponent just won with rock and may expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they expect paper, they'll likely play scissors\n   - But they might also try paper themselves for the +3 potential\n   - I'll play rock - it beats scissors (if they counter my expected paper) and only loses -3 to paper\n\n[move] (Opponent just won with rock and may expect me to counter with paper, so they might play scissors - playing rock to beat scissors) rock",

Identify the new pattern emerging:\n   - Opponent tied on paper twice, then tied on scissors when I switched\n   - They broke the pattern with paper when I played rock (winning big)\n   - Now they tied with rock when I repeated rock\n   - This suggests they might be reading my tendencies and adapting\n\n3. Analyze opponent's strategy:\n   - They seem to mirror me for ties, but break the pattern strategically for wins\n   - They chose paper over rock in round 4, suggesting they predicted my switch to rock\n   - They matched rock in round 5, possibly expecting me to repeat after a loss\n   - They're showing sophisticated prediction abilities\n\n4. Consider my next move options:\n   - If they expect me to switch from rock: they might play paper (anticipating scissors) or scissors (anticipating paper)\n   - If they think I'll stick with rock: they might play paper for the big win (+3)\n   - Given their pattern of strategic breaks, paper seems likely\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown they can predict when I'll switch vs. repeat\n   - They just matched my rock, so they might expect me to change\n   - If they play paper (expecting me to change to scissors), I should play scissors to tie or rock to lose big\n   - But if they expect me to play scissors, they'd play rock\n   - Playing scissors gives me the best chance to either tie or win against their likely moves\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors, as it beats paper (if they go for another big win) and only loses to rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze their likely next move:\n   - They just lost with paper to my scissors\n   - They might switch away from paper after this loss\n   - They could play rock to counter scissors if they expect me to repeat my winning move\n   - Or they might play scissors, thinking I'll switch to rock to counter expected paper\n\n4.

Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they play rock (expecting me to repeat scissors): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors (thinking I'll switch to rock): I should play rock (+1 points)\n   - If they return to paper: I should play scissors (+1 points)\n   - Given their tendency toward paper and my need to recover points, playing paper for the potential +3 seems optimal\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially get the big win if they choose rock to counter my winning scissors move.\n\n[move] paper"

Gut feeling for next move:\n   - Not overthinking this\n   - Paper feels right to me now\n   - No logical reason - just what my instinct says\n   - Trust the process that's been working\n\nFinal decision: Play paper - purely based on instinct, not analysis.

Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategic implications:\n   - Playing paper has the highest potential reward but also highest potential penalty\n   - Playing rock is safer against paper (only -3) but vulnerable to paper\n   - Playing scissors is risky against rock but good against paper\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced):\n   - New players often default to rock as it seems strong/aggressive\n   - This makes paper an attractive choice for maximum points\n   - However, if they think one level ahead, they might choose paper to beat expected rock\n\n5. First move strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round and I have no information about opponent patterns\n   - Paper offers the best risk/reward ratio if opponent chooses rock (common for beginners)\n   - Even if wrong, I learn about their tendencies for future rounds\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially gain the maximum 3 points if they choose the beginner-friendly rock.\n\n[move] paper",

Analyze their prediction ability:\n   - Round 4: They played paper when I switched to rock (big win for them)\n   - Round 7: They played scissors when I switched to paper (win for them)\n   - They're successfully predicting when I change strategies\n   - This suggests they're reading my psychological patterns\n\n4. Consider what they might expect now:\n   - I just lost with paper, so they might expect me to switch again\n   - If they think I'll play rock (to counter scissors), they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll play scissors (frustrated response), they might play rock\n   - They've shown they can predict my switches effectively\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - They're outplaying me by predicting my moves when I switch\n   - Maybe I should do something unexpected - stick with the same move\n   - Or try to think one level deeper about their predictions\n   - Given their success rate at predicting switches, I should consider repeating paper\n   - This breaks their pattern of successfully counter-predicting my switches\n\nFinal decision: Play paper again - if they expect me to switch after losing, staying with paper might catch them off guard.\n\n[move] paper",

Consider their next move options:\n   - If they think I'll repeat paper (since it just won big), they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch away from paper, they might play paper themselves\n   - If they return to their original paper preference, we'd tie\n   - They might play scissors to counter a repeated paper\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - They've been good at predicting my switches, but bad when I don't switch\n   - They might expect me to repeat the winning paper move\n   - Playing rock would counter scissors (if they expect repeated paper)\n   - This also avoids the big loss risk of paper vs scissors (-1 instead of -3)\n   - Rock seems like the safest choice with decent upside\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter scissors, which they might choose expecting me to repeat my winning paper move.\n\n[move] rock",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately.
