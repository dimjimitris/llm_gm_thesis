    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "Looking at this rock-paper-scissors variant, I need to analyze the payoff structure to make an optimal decision.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, while rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win.\n\n3. Consider the risk-reward for each move:\n   - Playing paper: High reward (+3) if opponent plays rock, small penalty (-1) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing rock: Small reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, large penalty (-3) if opponent plays paper\n   - Playing scissors: Small reward (+1) if opponent plays paper, small penalty (-1) if opponent plays rock\n\n4. Against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they likely haven't analyzed the payoff structure deeply and might play randomly or go with common intuitive choices.\n\n5. The expected value favors paper due to its high reward potential, and even if I lose, the penalty is relatively small compared to the potential gain.\n\n6. Paper also beats rock, which is often a popular first choice for new players.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Opponent won with +1 points, I lost with -1 points\n   - This shows the opponent either got lucky or understood that scissors beats paper\n\n2. Consider opponent's potential strategy:\n   - They might think I'll avoid paper again since I just lost with it\n   - They might stick with scissors thinking it worked\n   - Or they might switch, expecting me to counter their scissors\n\n3. Evaluate my options against potential opponent moves:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: I should play rock (rock beats scissors, +1 for me)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (paper beats rock, +3 for me)  \n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play scissors (scissors beats paper, +1 for me)\n\n4. Consider the risk-reward again:\n   - Rock is a safe choice that beats scissors (if they repeat) with small reward\n   - Paper still has the highest potential reward (+3) but risky if they stick with scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper but only gives +1 point\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since the opponent just won with scissors, they might either repeat the winning move or expect me to counter it. Playing rock covers the case where they repeat scissors, and the penalty for being wrong (if they play paper) is manageable at -3.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider if this is intentional strategy:\n   - By alternating scissors/paper, they're avoiding rock entirely\n   - This makes sense because rock has the worst risk profile (loses -3 to paper)\n   - They're playing the two moves that either win big (+3 for paper) or win small (+1 for scissors)\n\n4. Plan my counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent plays paper (following the alternating pattern): I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent breaks pattern and plays scissors again: I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent surprises with rock: I lose -3 with scissors, but this seems least likely given their pattern\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - The opponent is clearly adapting and counter-adapting to my moves\n   - They seem to be reading my strategy and switching at key moments\n   - After I started countering scissors with rock, they switched to rock\n   - When I played paper to beat rock, they switched back to scissors\n   - This shows sophisticated gameplay - they're anticipating my moves\n\n3. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They might expect me to go back to rock (since scissors just beat my paper)\n   - Or they might think I'll try something different since rock/paper alternation didn't work\n   - They've shown they can break their own patterns when needed\n\n4. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - The opponent is playing adaptively, not just following a simple pattern\n   - They're using their scissors preference as a baseline but switching strategically\n   - I need to think about what they think I'll do\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they expect me to play rock (to counter their scissors): they might play paper\n   - If they think I'll avoid rock (since they just countered my paper): they might stick with scissors\n   - Given their adaptive play, paper might be unexpected and could catch them if they play rock\n\n6. Decision: The opponent is playing a sophisticated counter-game. Since they just won with scissors, they might expect me to counter with rock. Playing paper could surprise them if they switch to rock to counter my expected rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Key observations:\n   - The opponent is indeed playing adaptively and counter-adaptively\n   - They switched to rock (probably expecting me to play rock to counter their previous scissors)\n   - My paper play worked perfectly, giving me the maximum +3 points\n   - Recent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock (they played rock twice in last 3 rounds)\n\n3. Consider their likely reaction:\n   - They just lost -3 points to my paper\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it just won big)\n   - To counter paper, they would play scissors\n   - Or they might think I'll switch and play something else\n\n4.

Key observations:\n   - The opponent has shifted strategy significantly - they're now playing rock much more frequently\n   - Recent pattern shows: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They seem to have moved away from their early scissors preference\n   - This could be a reaction to my successful paper play in round 11\n\n3. Consider their strategic evolution:\n   - Early game: heavy scissors preference (5 of first 8 rounds)\n   - Mid-game: adaptive switching based on my moves\n   - Recent game: increased rock usage (4 of last 5 rounds)\n   - They might be settling into rock as a \"safe\" choice\n\n4. Analyze their potential thinking:\n   - Rock ties with rock (neutral), beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - They might be trying to avoid the big loss that paper can inflict\n   - The tie we just had might encourage them to stick with rock or switch\n\n5.

Key observations:\n   - The opponent continues to show sophisticated adaptive play\n   - They seem to anticipate when I'll play paper and counter with scissors\n   - This is the second time they've successfully countered my paper with scissors (rounds 10 and 13)\n   - They're reading my strategy and timing their scissors plays well\n\n3.

Key observations:\n   - The opponent has returned to their scissors preference - 8 out of 14 rounds\n   - Recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They seem to go through phases: early scissors preference, then rock phase, now back to scissors\n   - The tie might indicate they're settling back into scissors as their default\n\n3. Consider their strategic state:\n   - They've successfully used scissors to counter my paper plays twice\n   - The consecutive scissors plays (rounds 13-14) suggest confidence in this move\n   - They might continue with scissors, or they might expect me to counter with rock\n\n4.

Risk assessment and decision: The opponent has played scissors 8 out of 14 times and just played it twice in a row. While there's risk of them switching to paper, their strong scissors preference and recent pattern suggest rock is the optimal counter.

Key observations:\n   - The opponent's scissors preference is now extreme: 13 out of 20 rounds (65%)\n   - They've played scissors four times in a row, including three losses to my rock\n   - This is their longest scissors streak in the game\n   - I've now beaten their scissors with rock 5 times total, yet they keep returning to scissors\n\n3. Recognize the deeply ingrained pattern:\n   - This opponent has an almost compulsive preference for scissors\n   - Losing repeatedly with scissors doesn't change their behavior\n   - They occasionally switch (like to paper) but always revert to scissors quickly\n   - This is beyond strategic play - it's a psychological preference\n\n4. Consider the likelihood of change:\n   - They just lost with scissors again (4th loss to my rock)\n   - Any rational player would switch away from scissors at this point\n   - But their behavior shows they're not playing rationally - they're playing habitually\n   - The overwhelming statistical evidence suggests they'll play scissors again\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (most likely): I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent finally switches to paper: I lose -3 with rock\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I tie with rock (0 points)\n\n6. Risk-reward decision: The opponent has now played scissors 13 out of 20 rounds (65%) and four times in a row, despite repeated losses. This level of consistency despite negative outcomes indicates a behavioral pattern that's unlikely to change. Rock continues to be the optimal exploitation strategy, as the probability of scissors far outweighs the risk of paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key observations:\n   - The opponent's scissors preference is now at 14 out of 21 rounds (67%)\n   - They've played scissors five times in a row, including four consecutive losses to my rock\n   - I've now beaten their scissors with rock 6 times total\n   - This is completely irrational behavior from a game theory perspective\n\n3. Recognize the extreme behavioral pattern:\n   - This opponent is essentially \"addicted\" to playing scissors\n   - They continue playing scissors despite:\n     * Losing 6 times to my rock\n     * Having a clear pattern that I counter scissors with rock\n     * Basic game theory suggesting they should switch\n   - This transcends strategy - it's pure habit/compulsion\n\n4. Consider the mathematical reality:\n   - 67% scissors rate over 21 rounds is statistically overwhelming\n   - Five consecutive scissors plays despite repeated losses\n   - No rational strategic reason to continue this pattern\n   - All evidence points to continued scissors play\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (extremely likely): I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I lose -3 with rock\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I tie with rock (0 points)\n\n6. Risk-reward decision: The opponent has demonstrated an extreme, irrational attachment to scissors (14/21 rounds, 67%, five in a row despite losses). At this point, their behavior is so predictable that rock is virtually guaranteed to succeed. The mathematical expectation strongly favors rock, and their psychological pattern shows no signs of changing.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Strategic evaluation:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (almost certain): I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I lose -3 with rock\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I tie with rock (0 points)\n\n6. Risk-reward decision: The opponent has played scissors 15 out of 22 rounds (68%) and six times in a row despite five consecutive losses to my rock. This level of predictability is unprecedented.

Risk-reward decision: The opponent has played scissors 16 out of 23 rounds (70%) and seven times in a row despite six consecutive losses to my rock.
