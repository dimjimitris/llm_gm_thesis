    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Paper beats Rock: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Paper: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Paper has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider the opponent: They are described as a \"fresh player,\" which suggests they may not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.\n\n4. Evaluate opening move options:\n   - Rock: Safe middle option, beats scissors for +1\n   - Paper: High risk/high reward, beats rock for +3 but loses badly to scissors (-3)\n   - Scissors: Safe option, beats paper for +1\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they might choose Rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice for new players. Playing Paper would maximize my points if they choose Rock.\n\n6. Decision: I'll play Paper to capitalize on the potential +3 points if the opponent chooses the common beginner move of Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played Paper, opponent played Rock\n   - I won +3 points\n   - My prediction about a fresh player choosing Rock was correct\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely thought process now:\n   - They just lost to my Paper with their Rock\n   - They might think I'll play Paper again since it worked\n   - They might switch to Scissors to counter Paper\n   - Or they might try a different approach entirely\n\n3. Analyze my options for Round 2:\n   - If I play Paper again and they play Scissors, I lose -1 points\n   - If I play Rock and they play Scissors, I win +1 points\n   - If I play Scissors and they play Paper, I win +1 points\n\n4. Strategic reasoning: \n   - Playing Paper again is risky since they now know I used it\n   - The opponent likely expects me to repeat Paper or expects to counter it\n   - Rock would beat Scissors (if they're trying to counter my Paper)\n   - This creates a good risk/reward balance\n\n5.

Analyze opponent's behavior pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock (typical beginner choice)\n   - Round 2: Scissors (trying to counter my Paper from Round 1)\n   - They seem to be reacting to my previous moves rather than thinking ahead\n\n3.

Analyze opponent's clear pattern:\n   - Opponent has played Scissors in 3 out of 4 rounds (Rounds 2, 3, 4)\n   - They only deviated once (Rock in Round 1)\n   - This shows a strong preference or fixation on Scissors\n\n3.
