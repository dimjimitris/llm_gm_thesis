    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely has no established pattern, I should consider what a new player might choose. Many people instinctively go with Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's often seen as the \"strongest\" option.\n\nIf my opponent chooses Rock, I need Paper to beat it and get +3 points.\nIf my opponent chooses Paper, I need Scissors to beat it and get +1 point.\nIf my opponent chooses Scissors, I need Rock to beat it and get +3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice for new players, and beating Rock gives me the maximum reward, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"
