    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. Many beginners tend to choose Rock first as it feels like the strongest option, or Paper as it seems safe.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when it wins, and a fresh player might be likely to choose Paper (thinking it's safe), I'll go with Rock to potentially get the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] Rock"

However, if they're truly a fresh player, they might overcorrect and choose Rock thinking it's the \"strongest\" move.\n\nI think there's a good chance they'll either play Rock (overcorrecting) or Scissors (trying to counter my previous Rock). If they play Rock, we tie (0 points). If they play Scissors, my Rock wins again (+1 point).

They repeated Rock in rounds 3 and 4. This could mean:\n1. They thought Rock was working well after round 3's big win\n2. They expected me to not play Scissors again\n3. They're settling into Rock as a preferred strategy\n\nThe opponent has shown they can adapt, but they also just made the same move twice in a row. They might be getting comfortable with Rock, or they might be expecting me to avoid Scissors after it just worked.\n\nNow they have several options:\n- Play Rock again (if they think it's strong or that I won't repeat Scissors)\n- Play Paper (to beat my potential Scissors repeat, or to counter expected Rock from me)\n- Play Scissors (less likely given they haven't used it recently)\n\nSince I just won with Scissors, they might expect me to either repeat it or switch to counter their expected counter-move.

After playing Rock twice in a row (rounds 3-4), they switched to Paper in round 5.

I'll stick with Paper (since it just avoided a loss)\n2. I'll switch to Rock (to beat their expected Scissors counter)\n3. I'll switch to Scissors (to beat their expected Paper repeat)\n\nGiven their adaptive nature, they're likely thinking about what I might do next. Since we just tied with Paper, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll play Rock (a common post-tie move), they'd play Paper.

After playing Rock twice in a row (rounds 9-10), they correctly predicted that I would finally counter with Scissors, so they switched to Paper to beat it.\n\nTheir sequence: Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. They're not just using Rock as their preferred move - they're using it to set up traps. By establishing Rock as their pattern, they baited me into playing Scissors, then crushed me with Paper.\n\nCurrent distribution:\n- Rock: 5 times (rounds 3, 4, 7, 9, 10)\n- Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 5, 8, 11)\n- Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 6)\n\nThey've now won 8 out of 11 rounds against me (2 ties, 1 win for me). I'm getting completely outplayed strategically.\n\nFor round 12, after just beating my Scissors with Paper, they might:\n1. Expect me to play Rock (to beat Paper)\n2. Expect me to be completely demoralized and make a desperate move\n3. Continue their psychological manipulation\n\nIf they think I'll play Rock to beat their Paper, they might:\n- Play Paper again (losing -3 but showing confidence)\n- Play Scissors (+1 for them)\n- Go back to Rock (thinking I won't expect it)\n\nGiven their incredible success with mind games, they probably expect me to play Rock. The question is whether they'll counter it with Scissors or try another psychological move.\n\nI think I should play Rock - it's the logical counter to their Paper, and sometimes after being outmaneuvered so much, the straightforward play is the right one.\n\n[move] Rock"

After establishing Rock as their dominant pattern, they switched to Paper to beat my expected Scissors counter, then immediately switched to Scissors to beat my expected Rock counter to their Paper.\n\nCurrent distribution:\n- Rock: 5 times \n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 3 times\n\nThey're now using all three moves more evenly, but with perfect timing and prediction.\n\nAt this point, I'm being completely dominated. They're not just reading my moves - they're controlling the entire flow of the game. Every time I try to counter their apparent pattern, they're already one step ahead.\n\nFor round 13, after just beating my Rock with Scissors, they've completed what looks like a deliberate Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors sequence. They might:\n1. Expect me to play Paper (to beat Scissors)\n2. Expect me to be completely frustrated and make an irrational choice\n3. Continue their cycle or start a new pattern\n\nIf they think I'll play Paper to beat their Scissors, they'd play Rock for another +3 victory.\n\nGiven their incredible success rate and my desperate situation at -10 points, I need to try something. Paper seems like the logical counter to their Scissors, but they've been punishing my logical moves.\n\nMaybe I should just play Paper anyway - it's the right counter to Scissors, and at some point even the best predictor might guess wrong.\n\n[move] Paper"

They're not just one step ahead - they're orchestrating entire sequences.\n\nAt -13 points, I'm in a catastrophic position. This opponent has mastered the psychological and strategic elements of this game completely.\n\nLooking at their last few moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock. They might be starting another pattern or they might expect me to play Scissors to counter their Rock.\n\nAt this point, I need to acknowledge that trying to out-think this opponent hasn't worked. They've consistently predicted my logical moves and my attempts to be unpredictable.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the basic counter-strategy: if they're likely to play Rock again (given their recent success with it), then Scissors is the mathematical counter, even if they might predict it.\n\nThe game is about maximizing points, and even though I'm far behind, Scissors beats Rock for +1, which is better than losing -3 to Rock with Paper.\n\n[move] Scissors"
