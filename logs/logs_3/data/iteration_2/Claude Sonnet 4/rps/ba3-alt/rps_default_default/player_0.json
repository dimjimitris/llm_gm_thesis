    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they're probably choosing randomly or going with their first instinct.\n\nMany people instinctively choose rock first (it's often the default choice), so playing paper would beat that and give me +3 points. However, if they choose scissors, I'd lose -1 point. If they also choose paper, it's a tie.\n\nGiven that rock offers the highest potential reward and many beginners might avoid it thinking others expect it, I'll go with rock to try for the +3 point advantage.\n\n[move] rock"

Let me reconsider the payoff structure - it seems I misunderstood who gets the points when moves beat each other.\n\nLooking at this more carefully:\n- My opponent played paper, I played rock\n- Paper beats rock \n- The hint says \"You won the round\" and \"You scored 3 points\"\n\nThis suggests that when I play rock and they play paper, somehow I still win? Let me re-read the rules... Actually, I think there might be some confusion in the feedback, because traditionally paper beats rock.\n\nBut taking the feedback at face value - I won with rock against their paper and scored 3 points. If this pattern holds, then rock seems to be a strong choice.\n\nHowever, now that my opponent has seen me play rock, they might adjust their strategy. If they think I'll play rock again, they might choose the move that beats rock. But given the apparent scoring system, I'm not entirely sure which move that would be.\n\nSince rock worked well last round and I'm still uncertain about the exact mechanics, I'll stick with rock for now to see if the pattern continues.\n\n[move] rock"

Their recent sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nThis confirms their behavior:\n- When I beat their scissors with paper, they switch to rock to counter expected paper\n- It's a very consistent pattern from them\n\nNow that I just beat their rock with scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to paper (to counter my expected scissors continuation)\n2. Go back to scissors (their most frequent move overall)\n3. Continue with rock (though less likely after losing)\n\nBased on their pattern recognition skills, they probably expect me to continue with scissors after my success. If they expect scissors from me, they should play paper to counter it.\n\nAlso, looking at their recent 3-move pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. If this is a cycle they're trying, the next move would be paper again.\n\nI think they'll play paper, so I'll play rock to beat it for the valuable +3 points.\n\n[move] rock"

If this pattern holds, the next move should be scissors.\n\nRecent 4 moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 ?\n\nIf they're following the paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle, then after paper comes scissors.\n\nHowever, they might also adapt since I just successfully predicted their paper and won big with rock. They could:\n1. Continue the cycle with scissors\n2. Break the cycle, expecting me to predict scissors\n3. Switch to rock (their frequent fallback when patterns get broken)\n\nGiven that I just won +3 by predicting their paper, they might expect me to predict scissors next and could switch to rock to counter my expected paper.\n\nBut the cycling pattern has been quite consistent in their last few moves. I'll trust the pattern and predict scissors, playing paper to beat it.\n\n[move] paper"
