They repeated Rock in rounds 3 and 4. This could mean:\n1. They thought Rock was working well after round 3's big win\n2. They expected me to not play Scissors again\n3. They're settling into Rock as a preferred strategy\n\nThe opponent has shown they can adapt, but they also just made the same move twice in a row.

I'm getting completely outplayed strategically.\n\nFor round 12, after just beating my Scissors with Paper, they might:\n1. Expect me to play Rock (to beat Paper)\n2. Expect me to be completely demoralized and make a desperate move\n3. Continue their psychological manipulation\n\nIf they think I'll play Rock to beat their Paper, they might:\n- Play Paper again (losing -3 but showing confidence)\n- Play Scissors (+1 for them)\n- Go back to Rock (thinking I won't expect it)\n\nGiven their incredible success with mind games, they probably expect me to play Rock. The question is whether they'll counter it with Scissors or try another psychological move.\n\nI think I should play Rock - it's the logical counter to their Paper, and sometimes after being outmaneuvered so much, the straightforward play is the right one.\n\n[move] Rock"

For the first time, they didn't successfully predict and counter my move. We both chose Rock, which suggests either:\n1. They expected me to play Rock and chose it themselves for some reason\n2. They're starting to think more straightforwardly after their complex predictions\n3. They wanted to play it safe with a tie rather than risk a loss\n\nLooking at their recent sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock. After beating my Scissors with Paper in round 8, they went back to Rock in round 9.\n\nTheir move distribution so far:\n- Rock: 4 times (rounds 3, 4, 7, 9)\n- Paper: 3 times (rounds 1, 5, 8)  \n- Scissors: 2 times (rounds 2, 6)\n\nRock is clearly their preferred move, appearing in 4/9 rounds. They've had great success with it, earning two +3 victories.\n\nFor round 10, after a tie with Rock, they might:\n1. Stick with Rock (since it's their most successful move)\n2. Expect me to switch away from Rock and play Scissors to beat my expected alternative\n3. Play Paper if they think I'll repeat Rock\n\nGiven that they just tied with Rock and have had great success with it overall, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with Rock again. However, they might also expect me to switch away from Rock after the tie.\n\nIf I play Scissors and they repeat Rock, I lose -1. If I play Paper and they play Rock, I win +3. If I play Rock and they play Scissors, I lose -1.\n\nI think Paper gives me the best expected value here - it wins big against their favored Rock and has good upside potential.\n\n[move] Paper",

Mix it up, but their recent pattern suggests they're doubling down on Rock\n\nGiven how successful Rock has been for them and how badly I've been losing when I don't counter it properly, I think they'll likely stick with Rock again.

If this pattern continues, they might go back to Rock next.\n\nAlternatively, they could be adapting based on what beats my previous moves:\n- I played Paper (Round 1) \u2192 They learned Rock beats Paper\n- I played Scissors (Round 2) \u2192 They stuck with Rock  \n- I played Rock (Round 3) \u2192 They switched to Paper (but Rock beat Paper, so this doesn't fit)\n- I played Rock (Round 4) \u2192 They played Scissors (which beats Rock)\n\nThe most recent move suggests they might be directly countering my previous move. If they think I'll play Rock again (since I played it twice in a row), they might play Scissors again.\n\nBut I should also consider that if they're cycling, the next move would be Rock.\n\nGiven the options:\n- If they play Rock, I should play Scissors (+1)\n- If they play Paper, I should play Rock (+3)  \n- If they play Scissors, I should play Paper (+1)\n\nSince there's uncertainty, I'll go with Paper to counter potential Scissors, as that seems like a reasonable prediction based on their recent adaptive behavior.\n\n[move] Paper"

They stuck with Rock for two rounds, then switched to Paper when Rock lost. This suggests they might be learning or following a pattern.\n\nNow I need to predict their next move:\n1. They might stick with Paper (since switching worked)\n2. They might switch to Scissors (continuing to cycle through options)\n3. They might go back to Rock (since it worked in round 1)\n\nIf they play Paper again, I need Rock (+3 points)\nIf they play Scissors, I need Paper (+1 point)  \nIf they play Rock, I need Scissors (+1 point)\n\nGiven that they just switched and might continue exploring options, and considering that Scissors would be the next logical move in a cycling pattern (Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors), I'll anticipate Scissors and play Paper.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they'll stick with Paper since it represented a successful strategy change. The high reward for beating Paper with Rock (+3) makes this an attractive option.\n\nI'll go with Rock, betting they'll either stick with Paper or that the high reward justifies the risk.\n\n[move] Rock",
