          "text": "Great! My scissors beat their rock for +1 point. \n\nCurrent running total: -3 + 1 = -2 points\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 2: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1)\n\nInteresting - my opponent played rock twice in a row (rounds 7 and 8). They seem to favor rock, which makes sense given its high payoff potential. But they just lost with it, so they might switch strategies.\n\nFor round 9, I need to consider:\n1. Will they stick with rock a third time?\n2. Will they switch to paper to beat scissors (expecting me to repeat)?\n3. Will they try scissors for variety?\n\nGiven that they just lost with rock and I won with scissors, they might expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock. But they also might switch away from rock after losing with it.\n\nI think paper is a good choice here. If they go back to rock (which they seem to favor), I'll get that valuable +3 points. If they play scissors, I'll lose only 1 point.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My paper lost to their rock again.\n\nCurrent running total: -2 - 3 = -5 points\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 2: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 3: I played paper, they played scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 4: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 5: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1)\n- Round 7: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 8: I played scissors, they played rock (I won +1)\n- Round 9: I played paper, they played rock (I lost -3)\n\nMy opponent has now played rock in rounds 7, 8, and 9 - three times in a row! They clearly have a strong preference for rock, probably because of its high payoff value. Even after losing once with it in round 8, they went right back to it.\n\nThis is a clear pattern I need to exploit. If they keep favoring rock, I should be playing paper to beat it. But I've tried paper twice against their rock and lost both times because I'm second-guessing myself or the timing is off.\n\nFor round 10, I'm going to stick with the math: if they love rock, I need to play paper. I can't keep avoiding the optimal counter just because it's been painful.\n\n[move] paper\n"
