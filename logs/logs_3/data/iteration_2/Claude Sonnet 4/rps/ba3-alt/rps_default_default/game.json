Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their instinct. Many people instinctively choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and if the opponent chooses Rock (as many beginners do), I should choose Paper to beat it and gain 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper - Going with Paper as it beats Rock, which many new players tend to choose first, and gives me the maximum 3-point reward.\n"

According to the rules, Paper beats Scissors, so they should have won +1 and I should have lost -1. But the result says I lost -1, which matches what should have happened.\n\nActually, I think I made an error in my reasoning. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf they played Paper and the pattern continues, and I wanted to beat Paper, I should have played Rock (Rock beats Paper), not Scissors (Paper beats Scissors).\n\nThe alternating pattern is still holding:\n- Round 7: Their Scissors  \n- Round 8: Their Paper\n- Round 9: Their Scissors\n- Round 10: Their Paper  \n- Round 11: Their Scissors\n- Round 12: Their Paper\n\nI'm now at +6 points total (+7 - 1 = +6).\n\nIf the pattern continues, their next move should be Scissors. To beat Scissors, I need Paper.\n\nBut I need to consider: they've now won 2 rounds in a row after losing 4 straight. This might give them confidence to either stick with what's working or potentially break the pattern.\n\nHowever, the alternating pattern has been incredibly consistent across 6 rounds. I should trust it.\n\n[move] Paper\n\nI'm choosing Paper because their alternating pattern suggests Scissors is next, and Paper beats Scissors for +1 points.\n"
