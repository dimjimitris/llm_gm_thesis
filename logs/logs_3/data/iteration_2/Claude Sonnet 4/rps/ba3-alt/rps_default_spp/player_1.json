    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The fresh player chose Paper, not Rock as we predicted. This suggests they might be thinking one level deeper - perhaps they anticipated that we'd expect Rock and chose Paper to beat our expected Scissors counter. Or they could be playing more randomly than we thought.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** We need to update our model of this opponent. They didn't fall into the \"fresh player chooses Rock\" pattern. This could mean:\n1. They're thinking strategically \n2. They're playing randomly\n3. They have some other preference or pattern\n\nSince we only have one data point, we should consider what they might do next.

If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might switch. If they found success with Paper, they might stick with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they stick with Paper, we should play Rock for the +3 points. If they think we'll counter their Paper with Rock, they might switch to Scissors. The high reward for Rock (+3) makes it tempting, but the high penalty (-3) makes it risky.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Let's consider the psychology: they just won with Paper. Fresh players often repeat winning moves at least once. Paper seems like a reasonable bet for them to repeat.

The opponent chose Paper again, confirming our hypothesis that they might repeat a winning move. Now we have a pattern: Paper, Paper. This gives us valuable information about their behavior.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We need to consider what they'll do after losing this round. They might:\n1.

The opponent chose Rock, not Scissors as we predicted. Their pattern is now: Paper, Paper, Rock. They didn't try to counter our Rock - instead they copied our winning move. This suggests they might be a \"copycat\" or \"follow the winner\" type player.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant behavioral insight. Instead of trying to counter our successful Rock, they adopted it themselves. This could indicate:\n1. They're copying successful strategies\n2. They're gravitating toward Rock after seeing its +3 payoff potential\n3. They might stick with Rock next round since it avoided a loss\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have Paper, Paper, Rock as their sequence. If they're copying winning moves or sticking with Rock because it didn't lose, what should we expect next?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they stick with Rock, we need Scissors for +1. If they think \"everyone will expect Rock now\" and switch to Paper, we need Rock again for +3. If they try to counter what they think we'll play (Scissors to beat their Rock), they'd choose Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's think about this psychologically.

This suggests they might have a preference for Paper, or they're alternating between their \"comfort moves\" of Paper and Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze what we know:\n- Round 1: They played Paper (won against our Scissors)\n- Round 2: They played Paper (lost to our Rock) \n- Round 3: They played Rock (tied with our Rock)\n- Round 4: They played Paper (won against our Scissors)\n\nThey've played Paper 3 times and Rock 1 time.

The only deviation was Round 3 with Rock, but they immediately returned to Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a remarkably consistent pattern. Paper appears in 80% of their moves. The single Rock was likely either:\n1. A brief attempt to copy our winning move\n2. Random variation\n3. An attempt to be unpredictable that they quickly abandoned\n\nGiven this strong behavioral pattern, we should strongly consider Rock again.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just lost with Paper again, but they've shown a tendency to return to Paper even after losses. In Round 2 they lost with Paper, played Rock once in Round 3, then went right back to Paper for Rounds 4 and 5.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Exactly! Even when Paper fails, they seem drawn back to it.

Their sequence is now: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors. After 4 Papers and 1 Rock, they finally played Scissors! This is their first Scissors in 6 rounds. They might be adapting or trying to be less predictable after we successfully exploited their Paper preference twice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a significant development. They may have realized we were countering their Paper effectively (we won +3 twice with Rock vs their Paper). The switch to Scissors could indicate:\n1. They're learning and adapting\n2.

They're trying to be more unpredictable\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So their overall pattern is still Paper-heavy (4 out of 6), but they just showed they can adapt.

Their sequence is now: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper. That's 5 out of 7 rounds with Paper (71%)! Even after their successful Scissors experiment, they immediately returned to Paper. This confirms their deep preference for Paper as their default move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a textbook example of a player with a dominant strategy. Despite brief deviations (1 Rock, 1 Scissors), they consistently return to Paper. The pattern shows:\n- Paper is their comfort zone\n- They occasionally experiment but revert quickly\n- Even after Paper loses, they go back to it\n- They seem unable to break this behavioral pattern\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now lost with Paper multiple times to our Rock, yet they keep returning to it. This suggests either they haven't fully learned the pattern, or Paper feels so natural to them they can't help but choose it.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Exactly! This is classic fresh player behavior - they have a \"favorite\" move that feels right to them, and even when it fails, they trust it will work \"next time.\" The single Scissors was likely them thinking \"I need to try something different\" but then immediately reverting to their preference.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The mathematical case for Rock is even stronger now:\n- 5/7 = 71% historical Paper rate\n- Just confirmed the reversion pattern after experiments\n- Expected value of Rock is overwhelmingly positive\n- They seem locked into this behavioral pattern despite losses\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Their predictability is remarkable. Seven rounds in, and Paper remains their go-to choice. Rock continues to be our optimal counter.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock again to exploit their persistent Paper preference.\n\n[move] (They returned to paper immediately after their scissors experiment, confirming their strong paper preference at 5 out of 7 rounds, so playing rock again) rock\n"

Their sequence is now: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors. They played Scissors again! This is their second Scissors in the last 3 rounds, after playing it only once in the first 6 rounds. They might be learning to counter our Rock strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is significant adaptation. The pattern shows:\n- Rounds 1-5: Mostly Paper (4/5)\n- Round 6: First Scissors (successful vs our Rock)\n- Round 7: Back to Paper (lost to our Rock)  \n- Round 8: Scissors again (successful vs our Rock)\n\nThey're starting to recognize that Scissors beats our frequent Rock plays. This suggests they're learning and adapting their strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So they might be shifting from a Paper-dominant strategy to a more balanced approach, or even favoring Scissors now that they've seen it work twice against our Rock. What should we expect next?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** We need to consider: Are they switching to a Scissors preference, or are they alternating between Paper and Scissors? Their recent pattern suggests they might continue with Scissors since it's been successful in 2 of their last 3 attempts.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play Scissors again, Rock gives us +1. But if they think we'll counter their Scissors pattern with Rock, they might switch back to Paper or try Rock themselves. However, given that Scissors just worked twice, they might stick with it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But we should also consider that they might revert to Paper again, as they did after their first successful Scissors. Their overall stats are still 5 Paper, 1 Rock, 2 Scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** True, but the recent trend matters more than historical data. They seem to be learning that Scissors counters our Rock-heavy strategy. I expect them to continue with Scissors or possibly alternate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they stick with Scissors, Rock wins +1. The risk-reward still favors Rock, especially since their Paper preference (though weakened) could still emerge.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to counter potential continued Scissors play, accepting they may be learning but betting on either Scissors continuation or Paper reversion.\n\n[move] (They may be learning to use scissors against my rock strategy, but I expect them to either continue with scissors or revert to their paper preference) rock\n"

They've clearly learned that Scissors beats our Rock-heavy strategy and are exploiting it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a major strategic shift. Let's look at the phases:\n- Rounds 1-5: Paper-dominant (4 Paper, 1 Rock)\n- Rounds 6-9: Scissors emergence (2 Paper, 3 Scissors)\nThey've successfully countered our Rock strategy three times now. We need to adapt or they'll keep punishing us.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We've been too predictable with Rock! They've figured out our pattern and are now consistently choosing Scissors to counter it. We need to change our approach completely.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Exactly! If they continue with Scissors (which is logical since it's working), we should play Rock for +1. But more importantly, if they expect us to play Rock again, they'll likely stick with Scissors. However, we could surprise them by switching strategies entirely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's consider our options:\n1. Play Rock (if they continue Scissors): +1 point\n2. Play Paper (if they switch back to counter-Rock): risky but could work if they overthink\n3. Play Scissors (if they revert to Paper or play Rock): could be a good mix-up\n\nGiven they just played 3 Scissors in 4 rounds, Rock seems most likely to succeed.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** But wait - what if they're thinking one level deeper? They might expect us to finally counter their Scissors with Rock, so they could switch to Paper to beat our expected Rock. This is getting quite strategic.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** True, but their recent behavior suggests they're sticking with what works. Three successful Scissors in a row creates momentum. They're likely to continue until we prove we can counter it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Until we show we can adapt, they'll probably stick with their successful Scissors strategy.

They have completely figured out our Rock strategy and are ruthlessly exploiting it. We're being outplayed strategically.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're in serious trouble. They've adapted perfectly while we've been predictable. Our Rock-heavy strategy (we've played Rock in most recent rounds) has been completely countered. They're now playing Scissors with high confidence because they know we favor Rock. We MUST change our approach immediately.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right.

We've lost 5 consecutive rounds by playing Rock while they consistently counter with Scissors. We're being systematically destroyed.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We have failed catastrophically at adaptation. They figured out our Rock preference around round 6 and have been mercilessly exploiting it ever since. Meanwhile, we've been incredibly stubborn, playing Rock repeatedly despite it failing over and over. This is a textbook example of how NOT to play strategically.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right. I've been making the same mistake repeatedly.

We played Paper, they played Scissors.

Play Scissors again (expecting more Rock from us)\n2. Switch to Paper (to beat our expected Rock counter)\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I lean toward them playing Scissors again. It just worked, it's their most successful move historically, and they might think we'll stubbornly stick with Rock like we did before.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play Scissors again, Rock gives us +1. The risk is if they switch to Paper expecting our Rock, then we lose -3. But their recent success with Scissors might encourage them to continue.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock again, betting they'll continue with their successful Scissors strategy.\n\n[move] (Scissors just worked for them again and is their most successful move historically, so they might continue with it expecting me to keep playing rock) rock\n"

Their sequence is now: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors. That's 9 Scissors out of 17 rounds (53%), and they just beat us with Scissors for the second consecutive time. We're becoming predictable with Rock again!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is deeply concerning. We're repeating our earlier mistake of becoming too predictable with Rock. They've now successfully used Scissors against our Rock in back-to-back rounds. We're falling into the same pattern that got us into trouble before - they're reading our Rock tendency and exploiting it with Scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right. I'm making the same strategic error that cost me 5 straight losses earlier. I'm becoming predictable with Rock again, and they're punishing me with Scissors. I need to break this pattern immediately before it becomes another losing streak.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The critical insight is that they're likely expecting Rock from us again. We've played Rock in the last two rounds, and they've successfully countered with Scissors both times. If we play Rock a third time, they'll probably play Scissors again and beat us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We absolutely must NOT play Rock again. They're clearly onto our Rock pattern and are countering it effectively. Our options are:\n1. Paper - would lose to Scissors if they continue, but win against Rock if they switch\n2. Scissors - would tie with their Scissors if they continue, or beat Paper if they revert\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I cannot play Rock again. That would be repeating the exact same mistake that led to my 5-game losing streak earlier. I need to switch to either Paper or Scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they expect us to play Rock (which is reasonable given our last two moves), they'll likely play Scissors again. Paper would lose to that, but Scissors would tie. However, if they think we'll finally adapt, they might switch strategies.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I recommend Scissors. If they continue their successful Scissors pattern (expecting our Rock), we tie instead of lose. If they switch to Paper (reverting to an old strategy), we win +1. It's safer than Paper against their likely Scissors continuation.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to avoid another Rock trap and either tie or win depending on their choice.\n\n[move] (I'm falling into the same Rock predictability trap that cost me earlier, must switch to scissors to either tie with their likely scissors or beat paper if they switch) scissors\n"

Their sequence is now: Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors. That's 10 Scissors out of 18 rounds (56%), and they continued their Scissors pattern as we predicted. By switching to Scissors, we avoided another loss and got a tie instead.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Excellent adaptation! We correctly identified that we were falling into the same Rock trap that hurt us earlier, and we broke the pattern just in time. The tie is much better than the -1 we would have gotten with Rock vs their Scissors. This shows we're learning to avoid our own predictable patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** That was a crucial decision. I was about to repeat the same Rock obsession that led to multiple losses earlier. By switching to Scissors, I avoided giving them another easy win. Now the question is: what's their next move?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They've now played Scissors 3 times in a row (rounds 16-18). This is reminiscent of their earlier 6-Scissors streak. The question is: will they continue this Scissors run, or will they switch strategies after the tie?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's consider their options:\n1. Continue with Scissors (if they think we'll switch away from it after the tie)\n2. Switch to Rock (if they expect us to continue with Scissors or go back to Rock)\n3. Switch to Paper (if they expect us to counter their Scissors with Rock)\n\nTheir historical pattern shows they can maintain Scissors streaks, but they also adapt when needed.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we just tied with Scissors, they might think we'll switch away from it. If they continue with Scissors expecting us to change, then Rock would beat them. But if they switch to Paper (expecting us to counter with Rock), we'd lose -3.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I think they might continue with Scissors. They're in a rhythm with it (3 in a row), it's their most successful move historically, and they might expect us to switch after the tie. Rock would counter this well.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** But we need to be careful not to fall back into predictable Rock patterns. That said, a single Rock play to test if they continue their Scissors streak could be worth the risk, especially since Scissors has been so dominant for them.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** One Rock play to test their Scissors continuation seems reasonable, as long as I don't fall into a Rock pattern again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to test if they continue their current Scissors streak, while being careful not to become predictable again.\n\n[move] (They have played scissors 3 times in a row and might continue expecting me to switch away after the tie, so testing rock but staying alert to avoid falling into another rock pattern) rock\n"

That's 4 Scissors in a row and 11 out of 19 rounds total (58%)! More critically, we just played Rock and lost to their Scissors again. We're starting another dangerous Rock pattern!\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is extremely concerning! We're repeating the exact same mistake that led to our 5-game losing streak earlier. We said we'd be careful not to fall into Rock patterns, but we just played Rock and lost to Scissors again. If we play Rock again, we're officially back in the same trap that devastated us before.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** You're absolutely right! I'm making the same error again. I played Rock, they countered with Scissors (their 4th in a row), and now I'm at risk of becoming predictable with Rock again. I MUST NOT play Rock again or I'll be right back in the losing pattern that hurt me so badly earlier.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** They've now demonstrated they can maintain extended Scissors streaks (they had 6 in a row before, now 4 in a row). They're clearly comfortable with Scissors and it keeps working against our Rock tendencies. We absolutely cannot give them another easy Scissors-beats-Rock victory.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Our options are:\n1. Rock - ABSOLUTELY NOT! This would be falling into the same trap\n2. Paper - risky if they continue Scissors, but could work if they finally switch  \n3. Scissors - safe choice, either ties with their likely Scissors or beats Paper if they switch\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I will NOT play Rock. That's exactly how I got into trouble before. Between Paper and Scissors, which is safer?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Scissors is much safer. If they continue their 4-Scissors streak (which is likely), we tie instead of lose. If they switch to Paper, we win +1. Paper is too risky - if they stick with Scissors, we lose -1.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely agree. Scissors is the safe, smart choice. It protects us from their likely Scissors continuation while giving us upside if they switch to Paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to avoid falling into another Rock trap and safely handle their Scissors streak.\n\n[move] (I must not fall into another rock pattern like before, playing scissors to either tie with their likely continued scissors streak or beat paper if they switch) scissors\n"

That's 5 Scissors in a row and 12 out of 20 rounds total (60%)! They're in a major Scissors streak and showing no signs of stopping.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is demonstrating incredible consistency with Scissors. Five in a row is significant - they're either very comfortable with this strategy or they're trying to establish dominance with their most successful move. The good news is we've avoided losses by playing Scissors twice, getting ties instead of giving them easy wins.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm glad I avoided the Rock trap again. Two ties are much better than two losses. But this Scissors streak from them is remarkable - 5 in a row now. They seem very committed to this strategy.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The key question: will they continue this Scissors streak to 6 (matching their previous record), or will they finally switch? They might be testing our resolve, seeing if we'll break and go back to Rock. Or they might genuinely be committed to Scissors as their dominant strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Let's analyze their psychology:\n- 5 Scissors in a row shows strong commitment\n- They might expect us to eventually try Rock to counter them\n- They might continue until we show we can beat Scissors\n- Or they might switch, thinking we're now expecting Scissors\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with Scissors (making it 6 in a row), another Scissors gives us another tie. If they switch to Rock (expecting us to play Rock to counter their Scissors), our Scissors would win +1. If they switch to Paper, our Scissors would also win +1.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Scissors seems like the safest choice again. It guarantees we don't lose, and gives us upside if they finally switch away from their streak. The only downside is another tie if they continue.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I agree. Scissors is the optimal choice here. We're not falling into predictable patterns ourselves, we're protecting against their dominant strategy, and we have upside if they switch. It's strategically sound.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Yes, Scissors again. I'd rather tie than give them another easy win by going back to Rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors again to safely handle their extended Scissors streak while maintaining upside if they switch.\n\n[move] (They are now on a 5-scissors streak and I should continue with scissors to either tie safely or win if they finally switch strategies) scissors\n"
