    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Every strategic approach I've tried has failed:\n- Pattern recognition\n- Counter-prediction\n- Risk management\n- Going for high variance\n\nAt this point, I have to accept that my opponent is either extraordinarily skilled or has figured out some pattern in my thinking that I can't see myself.\n\nSince I'm down 7 points and nothing has worked, I might as well try Paper again. It's been 2 rounds since I used it, and maybe - just maybe - they won't expect me to return to it after the recent Rock failure.\n\nOr maybe I should just accept that I'm going to lose this next round too and pick whatever feels right in the moment. \n\nI'll go with Paper. At least when I lose with Paper, it's only -1 point instead of -3.\n\n[move] Paper"
