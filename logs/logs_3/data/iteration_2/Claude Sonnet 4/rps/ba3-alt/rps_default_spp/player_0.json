    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have an established strategy yet, they might play randomly or go with their instinct. Many beginners tend to start with Rock as it feels like the strongest option.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential reward (+3 points), and if my opponent chooses Rock (which beginners often do), I should play Paper to beat it and gain those 3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me reconsider the scoring - it seems I misunderstood initially.\n\nLooking at what happened:\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors\n- Scissors beats paper (scissors cuts paper)\n- My opponent won and got +1 point, I lost and got -1 point\n\nWait, the hint says I won and scored 1 point, but that doesn't match the game rules as I understood them. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, the hint says I won with paper against scissors, scoring 1 point. This means paper beats scissors in this version, which matches the original rule stated: \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points.\"\n\nSo my opponent played scissors, I played paper, and paper beat scissors for +1 point to me.\n\nNow for the next round: My opponent chose scissors in the first round. They might stick with it, try rock next, or switch to paper. Since they went with scissors first (which gives lower rewards), they might try rock next for the higher potential payoff.\n\nIf they play rock, I should play paper again to get +3 points.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
