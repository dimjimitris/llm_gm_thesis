You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

            "text": "Interesting! They broke their previous pattern. Instead of continuing with rock for a third round after paper (like they did in rounds 8-10), they switched back to paper after just two rocks.\n\nUpdated pattern analysis:\n- First sequence: Paper (R7) \u2192 Rock, Rock, Rock (R8-10) \n- Second sequence: Paper (R11) \u2192 Rock, Rock (R12-13) \u2192 Paper (R14)\n\nThey're now playing paper more frequently - this is the third paper in the last 8 rounds, compared to only one paper in the first 7 rounds. This suggests they may be:\n1. Adapting to counter my scissors strategy more aggressively\n2. Becoming less predictable\n3. Learning that paper beats my frequent scissors plays\n\nSince they just played paper and have been switching between paper and rock recently, I need to consider what comes next:\n- If they stick with paper (expecting me to continue with scissors), I should play rock for +3\n- If they return to rock (their historical preference), I should play scissors for +1\n- If they play scissors, I should play paper for +1\n\nGiven that they've used paper successfully twice now to counter my scissors, and rock is still their most common move overall, I think rock is the best choice here. It beats paper (+3) and beats scissors (+1), only losing to rock (which they might not expect me to play).\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Now they've played scissors! This is getting more complex. Let me analyze their recent evolution:\n\nRecent sequence:\n- Round 11: Paper\n- Round 12: Rock  \n- Round 13: Rock\n- Round 14: Paper\n- Round 15: Scissors\n\nThey're now using all three moves more frequently and seem to be adapting their strategy. They've moved from being heavily rock-focused to incorporating more variety:\n\nOverall count through 15 rounds:\n- Rock: 9 times (still most common)\n- Paper: 4 times (increasing frequency)  \n- Scissors: 2 times (new addition)\n\nThey appear to be learning and becoming less predictable. The fresh player is evolving their strategy, possibly noticing my counter-patterns.\n\nFor my next move, I need to consider:\n- They just played scissors (beats rock, loses to paper)\n- They've been mixing strategies more\n- Rock is still their most played move historically\n- They might continue diversifying or return to a favorite\n\nSince they're becoming more unpredictable and just played scissors, they might:\n1. Continue with varied play\n2. Return to rock (their comfort zone)\n3. Try paper again (it's worked well recently)\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll play paper. It beats both rock (their historical favorite) and scissors (their most recent play), and only loses to paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Let me look at their recent moves:\n\nRecent sequence:\n- Round 13: Rock\n- Round 14: Paper\n- Round 15: Scissors  \n- Round 16: Paper\n\nThey've now played paper twice in the last 4 rounds and are showing much more variety than their early rock-heavy strategy. \n\nCurrent overall distribution through 16 rounds:\n- Rock: 9 times\n- Paper: 5 times  \n- Scissors: 2 times\n\nThe opponent has clearly evolved from a predictable rock player to someone using more mixed strategies. They seem to have discovered that paper is effective (it's beaten my scissors multiple times and just tied with my paper).\n\nSince they just played paper twice in recent rounds (rounds 14 and 16), they might:\n1. Continue with paper since it's been working\n2. Switch back to rock (still their most-played move)\n3. Try scissors to complete a recent cycle\n\nGiven that paper has been successful for them lately and they just played it, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it or expect me to counter it with rock. If they play paper again, I need rock to beat it for +3. If they switch to rock (returning to their historical preference), I need scissors.\n\nI think rock is the better choice here - it beats paper for the maximum reward (+3) and beats scissors, only losing to rock. Since they've been favoring paper recently over rock, this seems like the higher probability play.\n\n[move] rock"
