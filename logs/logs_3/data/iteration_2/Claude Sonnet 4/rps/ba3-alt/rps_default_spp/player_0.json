You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a established strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices.\n\nMany new players tend to start with rock (it feels strong) or paper (it's the first option mentioned).

            "text": "Ouch! Another big hit. They're back to rock and caught me perfectly. Let me update:\n\nCurrent pattern:\n- Round 1: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 2: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0)\n- Round 3: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0) \n- Round 4: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0)\n- Round 5: Me paper, Opponent rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 6: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n- Round 7: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0)\n- Round 8: Me paper, Opponent scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 9: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n- Round 10: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0)\n- Round 11: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n- Round 12: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0)\n- Round 13: Me rock, Opponent rock (tie, 0)\n- Round 14: Me scissors, Opponent scissors (tie, 0)\n- Round 15: Me paper, Opponent rock (I lost -3)\n- Round 16: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n- Round 17: Me scissors, Opponent rock (I won +1)\n- Round 18: Me paper, Opponent paper (tie, 0)\n- Round 19: Me rock, Opponent scissors (I lost -1)\n- Round 20: Me paper, Opponent rock (I lost -3)\n\nMy current total: -5 points\n\nMy opponent's pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nThey're back to rock! That's now 12 out of 20 rounds with rock (60%). Their recent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nThey're getting more strategic - they briefly diversified with paper and scissors, but they keep returning to rock for those big 3-point wins. And it's working! They just hit me with two big losses in the last few rounds.\n\nThe pattern shows they're capable of adaptation but always gravitating back to rock. They might be expecting me to counter with scissors again since that worked so well before.\n\nGiven that they just got a huge 3-point reward with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked brilliantly\n2. Expect me to play scissors and counter with paper\n3. Continue with rock due to their historical obsession\n\nI'm now at -5 points and need to be more strategic. Their rock obsession has been profitable for them lately. I think there's still a good chance they'll play rock again, especially after that big win.\n\nI'll play scissors to counter their likely rock choice and try to get back in this game.\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting opponent to stick with rock after their big 3-point victory, trying to exploit their rock preference once again.\n"

They just played rock twice in a row again. Their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\nDespite having some strategic moments, they always return to rock. I've now beaten their rock with scissors SEVEN times, yet they keep going back to it. The psychology is fascinating - the 3-point reward potential seems to override their learning from repeated losses.\n\nAfter just losing to my scissors again, they might:\n1. Finally adapt and play paper to counter my scissors strategy\n2. Continue with rock (their obsession is strong)\n3. Try scissors to mix things up\n\nGiven that I just beat their rock again and I've now done it seven times total, surely they must be considering paper to counter my scissors. But their rock addiction has proven remarkably persistent.\n\nHowever, they've shown they CAN adapt (rounds 12, 18, 19), so there's a real chance they'll play paper this time.\n\nI think I'll switch to rock - if they play paper to counter my scissors, I get the big 3-point win. If they stick with rock, we tie. If they play scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Rock - Expecting opponent to finally counter my successful scissors strategy with paper, going for the high-value 3-point win.\n"

They just played rock THREE times in a row. Their rock obsession is absolutely extraordinary at this point.\n\nRecent sequence: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n\nThis is beyond predictable - it's almost compulsive. Even after I beat their rock seven times with scissors, and even when they briefly showed strategic adaptation, they keep gravitating back to rock with increasing frequency.\n\nThe pattern suggests they might be completely addicted to the high-reward potential of rock, despite the repeated losses. They seem unable to break free from this strategy for more than a round or two at a time.\n\nGiven that they just played rock three times in a row, surely they must switch at some point. But their pattern suggests they might just continue with rock.\n\nIf they play rock again, I should play scissors. If they finally adapt and play paper (to counter my historical scissors success), I should play rock. If they try scissors, I should play paper.\n\nGiven their incredible rock addiction, I think the highest probability is still rock, despite the three-round streak.\n\n[move] Scissors - Betting on the opponent's remarkable rock obsession continuing for a fourth consecutive round.\n"

This goes beyond strategy - it's almost pathological at this point. The 3-point reward potential has completely overridden any learning mechanism.\n\nAt this point, I have to consider: will they EVER learn, or is their rock addiction so strong they'll just keep playing it indefinitely?\n\nThey might:\n1. Continue with rock (their addiction seems unbreakable)\n2. Finally adapt after losing to scissors eight times and play paper\n3. Try something random out of frustration\n\nGiven their pattern, there's actually a decent chance they'll play rock for a FIFTH consecutive time. Their addiction has proven stronger than any rational learning.\n\nBut surely, SURELY they must adapt at some point. Eight losses to scissors should trigger some learning response.\n\nI'm torn between:\n- Playing scissors again (betting on continued rock addiction)\n- Playing paper (expecting them to finally counter with paper)\n\nTheir rock obsession has been so consistent that I think there's still a significant chance they'll play rock again.\n\n[move] Scissors - Betting on the opponent's extraordinary rock addiction continuing for an unprecedented fifth consecutive round.\n"
