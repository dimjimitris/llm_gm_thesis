    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Ties give 0 points to both\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common first instincts. Many people tend to choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice and Paper beats Rock with the maximum point gain, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Rock beats Paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats Rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nSo Rock beats Paper, not the other way around like in traditional rock-paper-scissors. I misunderstood the rules initially.\n\nThe correct relationships are:\n- Rock beats Paper (high risk/reward: +3/-3)\n- Paper beats Scissors (low risk/reward: +1/-1)  \n- Scissors beats Rock (low risk/reward: +1/-1)\n\nNow, my opponent just played Rock and won. They might:\n1. Stick with Rock since it worked and gives maximum points\n2. Switch to something else thinking I'll counter with Scissors\n3. Play randomly\n\nIf they play Rock again, I should play Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they switch to Paper, I should play Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they switch to Scissors, I should play Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that they just won with Rock (getting 3 points), they might be tempted to use it again. I'll counter with Scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors"

My opponent played Rock again, and my Scissors beat their Rock for +1 point.\n\nSo far the pattern is:\n- Round 1: Opponent played Rock\n- Round 2: Opponent played Rock again\n\nMy opponent seems to favor Rock, possibly because:\n1. It gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins\n2. They might not have fully grasped the strategy yet\n3. They could be testing if I'll keep countering with Scissors\n\nNow I need to decide: will they play Rock a third time, or will they adapt?\n\nIf they play Rock again, I should play Scissors (+1 for me)\nIf they switch to Paper, I should play Scissors (+1 for me)  \nIf they switch to Scissors, I should play Rock (+3 for me)\n\nScissors seems like a safe choice since it beats both Rock and Paper, giving me +1 in either case. The only risk is if they switch to Scissors, but that would just be a tie (0 points).\n\nHowever, if they're learning and realize I've been countering their Rock with Scissors, they might switch to Scissors to counter my expected Scissors. In that case, I should play Rock to win big (+3).\n\nI think they might adapt and try Scissors, so I'll go with Rock for the high-value play.\n\n[move] Rock"
