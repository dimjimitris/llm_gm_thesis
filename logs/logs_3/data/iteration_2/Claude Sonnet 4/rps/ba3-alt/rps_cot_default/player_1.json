    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I'm at -10 points and these ties aren't helping me recover. I need to win rounds, not tie them.\n\nKey realization: If they're playing rock 54% of the time, and I keep playing rock too, we'll keep tying. I need to play scissors more often to beat their rock preference, even though it's riskier.\n\nLet me calculate expected values again with their current frequencies:\n- If I play scissors: 54% chance of +1 (vs rock), 38% chance of -1 (vs paper), 8% chance of 0 = expected +0.16\n- If I play rock: 38% chance of +3 (vs paper), 8% chance of -1 (vs scissors), 54% chance of 0 = expected +1.06\n- If I play paper: 8% chance of +1 (vs scissors), 54% chance of -3 (vs rock), 38% chance of 0 = expected -1.54\n\nRock still has the highest expected value, but it keeps leading to ties!
