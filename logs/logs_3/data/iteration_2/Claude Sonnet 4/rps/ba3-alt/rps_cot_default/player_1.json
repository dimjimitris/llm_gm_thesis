    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often default to Rock as it's commonly associated with strength, or they might choose randomly.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest potential payoff and many beginners gravitate toward Rock, I'll choose Paper to counter this tendency while also positioning myself for the maximum point gain if I'm correct.\n\n[move] Paper"

I read that correctly and won again:\n\n- Round 1: Rock vs Paper \u2192 They won (+3/-3)\n- Round 2: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie (0/0)\n- Round 3: Scissors vs Scissors \u2192 Tie (0/0)  \n- Round 4: Rock vs Rock \u2192 Tie (0/0)\n- Round 5: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 They won (+1/-1)\n- Round 6: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won (+1/-1)\n- Round 7: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie (0/0)\n- Round 8: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 They won (+1/-1)\n- Round 9: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 They won (+1/-1)\n- Round 10: Rock vs Paper \u2192 I won (+3/-3)\n- Round 11: Paper vs Scissors \u2192 I won (+1/-1)\n\nCurrent score: Me -1 points, Opponent +1 points\n\nExcellent! I'm almost even now. My prediction was right - after losing with Paper, my opponent switched to Scissors, likely trying to counter an expected Rock from me. But I anticipated this and chose Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\nMy opponent's recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\nThey finally broke their Paper streak after the big loss in Round 10.\n\nFor Round 12, I need to consider:\n- They just lost with Scissors after abandoning their successful Paper strategy\n- They might go back to Paper (which worked for them for 4 rounds)\n- They might try Rock for the high-reward potential\n- They might expect me to stick with Paper and choose Scissors again\n\nGiven that they just lost trying to counter my expected Rock with Scissors, they might think I'll stick with Paper (since it just worked). If so, they might choose Scissors again to beat Paper, or go to Rock.\n\nHowever, they might also realize that going back to Paper (which worked so well for them) might be the smart move, especially since I just demonstrated I won't always choose Rock.\n\nI think there's a good chance they'll either try Scissors again (to beat what they think will be repeated Paper) or go back to Paper. If they choose Scissors, my Paper beats it. If they choose Paper, we tie.\n\nBut I should also consider Rock - if they go back to Paper, Rock gives me +3 points.\n\nI'll go with Rock. It's the high-reward play against Paper, and if they choose Scissors (thinking I'll repeat Paper), I only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Rock"

They chose Rock, same as me. After losing with Scissors in Round 11, they switched to Rock - possibly thinking I'd stick with Paper and they could get the high +3 reward. But I had the same idea about countering their potential return to Paper.\n\nWe've now had 6 ties out of 12 rounds, which is quite remarkable. This suggests we're thinking very similarly about the game dynamics.\n\nFor Round 13, after this Rock tie:\n- They might stick with Rock (it didn't lose)\n- They might expect me to counter Rock with Paper\n- They might cycle to something else\n- They could go back to their previously successful Paper strategy\n\nGiven that we just tied on Rock, and they know Rock carries high risk/reward, they might switch. If they think I'll choose Paper to counter Rock, they might choose Scissors. Or they might go back to Paper since it worked so well for them in rounds 7-10.\n\nI think after the Rock tie, they're more likely to switch than stick. Between Paper and Scissors, Paper was their most successful strategy recently. But they might also expect me to think this way and choose Scissors to counter expected Paper.\n\nI'll go with Scissors. If they return to Paper, I win. If they choose Rock thinking I'll go Paper, I lose only 1 point. If they choose Scissors, we tie.\n\n[move] Scissors"

This is now the 5th time they've beaten my Scissors with Paper (rounds 5, 8, 9, and 13).

This could mean:\n1. I'm being too predictable with Scissors\n2. They've identified situations where I tend to choose Scissors\n3. They're sticking with Paper because it consistently beats my Scissors\n\nFor Round 14, I need to break this cycle. They just won with Paper again, and they might expect me to finally counter with Scissors (since that's what Paper beats). But maybe they'll stick with Paper since it keeps working.\n\nI think it's time to choose Rock again. If they stick with their successful Paper strategy, I get +3 points. If they switch to Scissors expecting me to go Paper, I lose 1 point.
