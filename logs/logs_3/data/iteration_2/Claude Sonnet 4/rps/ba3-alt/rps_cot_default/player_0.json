    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Or choose randomly without much thought\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper seems like a strong opening move because:\n   - It counters rock (which fresh players often choose)\n   - It gives the maximum possible points (+3) when successful\n   - The penalty if wrong is only -1 point (much better than the -3 penalty rock faces)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player, aiming for the +3 point reward.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent also chose paper in round 1, which suggests:\n   - They might have similar strategic thinking (paper counters rock)\n   - They could be thinking defensively \n   - Or they might continue with paper again\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper (thinking it worked as a safe choice)\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might go to scissors (random change)\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I win +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If I play paper again: Likely another tie if they repeat\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock gives +3 if opponent plays paper again, but -3 if they switch to scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 if opponent plays paper, but -1 if they play rock\n   - Paper gives 0 if they repeat, +3 if they go rock, -1 if they go scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision: Since the opponent played paper last round, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it or think I'll stick with paper. Rock offers the highest reward (+3) against paper, and the opponent showing paper last round makes this a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get +3 points if they repeat paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze opponent's recent pattern evolution:\n   - Original pattern: PP-RR-PP\n   - Recent moves: Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n   - The opponent has now played scissors twice in the last 3 rounds\n\n3. Look for emerging strategies:\n   - The opponent seems to be favoring scissors recently (rounds 7 and 9)\n   - They might be trying to establish scissors as their new go-to move\n   - Or they could be in an S-R-S pattern\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're sticking with scissors (their recent preference): I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they're following S-R-S-?: Maybe rock next (alternating)\n   - If they're being more strategic: They might expect me to play rock and switch to paper\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+3 points, maximum reward)\n   - Rock loses to paper (-3 points, but manageable given my lead)\n   - The opponent has shown a recent tendency toward scissors\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent played scissors in rounds 7 and 9 (2 out of last 3 rounds)\n   - This suggests they might be favoring scissors as a strategy\n   - Rock gives me the maximum reward against scissors\n   - Even if wrong, I still maintain a positive score overall\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, capitalizing on the opponent's apparent preference for scissors in recent rounds.\n\n[move] rock"

Look for current trends:\n   - The opponent seems to favor Rock and Scissors primarily\n   - Paper was a brief deviation (only appeared once recently in round 16)\n   - They returned to Rock immediately after Paper\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they return to the S-R alternation: After Rock, Scissors should be next\n   - If they stick with Rock (which has been frequent): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Evaluate the probabilities:\n   - Rock has been their most frequent choice in recent rounds\n   - Scissors is also common in their alternation pattern\n   - Paper was rare and might have been experimental\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just played Rock (round 17)\n   - In their historical S-R pattern, Scissors typically follows Rock\n   - Rock beats Scissors for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - Even if they play Paper instead, the penalty is only -3, but Paper has been rare\n   - The S-R alternation has been their most consistent long-term pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the opponent returning to their scissors-rock alternation with scissors being next.\n\n[move] rock"

Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're returning to pairs strategy: Another Rock (making RRR)\n   - If they break the Rock streak: Could go to Scissors or Paper\n   - Their historical preference shows they like consistent patterns\n\n5.
