No, that's wrong.\n   - Paper beats Scissors, so if they play Paper, Scissors loses -1\n\n9. **Correct strategic analysis:**\n   - If they play Rock: Scissors beats Rock (+1 for me)\n   - If they play Paper: Paper beats Scissors (-1 for me)\n   - If they play Scissors: Scissors ties with Scissors (0 points)\n   - If they play Paper: Paper beats Scissors (-1 for me)\n\n10. **Re-evaluate options:**\n    - Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n    - Paper: +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper\n    - Rock: +3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n\n11. **Make the decision:**\n    - They just lost with Rock, so they might switch\n    - If they switch to Paper, Scissors loses -1\n    - If they switch to Scissors, Scissors ties 0\n    - If they stick with Rock, Scissors wins +1\n    - Given uncertainty, Rock might give me +3 if they switch to Paper\n    - But Rock loses badly to Scissors\n\n12. **Final strategic choice:**\n    - They've been Rock-heavy recently, but just lost\n    - A switch to Paper or Scissors seems likely\n    - Paper gives me +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper\n    - This covers the switch scenarios better than Scissors\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to beat Scissors if they switch, or tie if they switch to Paper, avoiding the -3 loss to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

(current decision)\n   - Previous Rock tie led to a switch\n   - This suggests they might switch away from Rock\n\n5. **Consider their Rock attachment:**\n   - Rock has been their most successful recent move\n   - They returned to Rock in round 17 after Paper tie\n   - But they've shown willingness to switch after Rock ties before\n   - Paper and Scissors are switch options\n\n6. **Analyze their overall move frequency:**\n   - Rock: Very frequent recently (rounds 13, 14, 15, 17)\n   - Paper: Less frequent (rounds 16)\n   - Scissors: Haven't played recently, but available\n   - They might switch to Scissors (least recent) or Paper\n\n7. **Predict their next move:**\n   - Based on Rock tie \u2192 switch pattern (round 3-4)\n   - Switch to Paper or Scissors seems likely\n   - Scissors hasn't appeared since round 12, so might be \"due\"\n   - Paper just had a tie in round 16, so less likely\n\n8. **Strategic analysis:**\n   - If they switch to Scissors: Paper beats Scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to Paper: Scissors beats Paper? No, Paper beats Scissors\n   - Wait, let me check rules again:\n     - Paper beats Scissors (+1 winner, -1 loser)\n     - If they play Scissors: I need Paper to beat it\n     - If they play Paper: Paper beats Scissors, so I lose with Scissors\n\n9. **Correct strategic analysis:**\n   - If they play Scissors: Paper beats Scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play Paper: Paper beats Scissors (-1 for me if I play Scissors)\n   - If they play Rock: Scissors beats Rock (+1 for me)\n\n10. **Evaluate my options:**\n    - Paper: +1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Paper, -3 vs Rock\n    - Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n    - Given they're likely to switch from Rock, and Scissors seems more likely than Paper (since Paper just tied), Paper is the better choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to beat the likely switch to Scissors after their Rock tie.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Remarkable coincidence\n\nGiven this tie streak, I need to think differently. If they're somehow anticipating my moves, I should try to be less predictable.\n\nLooking at what just happened:\n- I predicted they'd play rock, so I played scissors\n- They also played scissors\n\nIf they're trying to anticipate what I'll do, they might think I'll continue the pattern or try to break it.\n\nSince we just both played scissors, if the pattern continues they might expect me to play rock next (following rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle). So they might play scissors again to beat rock.\n\nBut if they're mirroring, they might play whatever they think I'll play.\n\nI'll try to break the pattern by going with paper.\n\n[move] Paper - Trying to break the tie streak with a different approach\n"
