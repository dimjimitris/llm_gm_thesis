Consider opponent strategy: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a specific pattern yet. They might choose randomly or go with common beginner tendencies.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward: While rock gives the highest reward, it also has the highest penalty (-3) if the opponent plays paper. However, the potential gain outweighs the risk.\n\n5.

Consider their psychology:\n   - They're on a winning streak (2 rounds)\n   - They've learned to adapt from their early scissors-heavy pattern\n   - They might continue being unpredictable\n   - Or they might have a new short-term pattern emerging\n\n5.

Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet.

Between Scissors and Rock, Rock gives them the higher potential reward if they're right. But Rock also carries the highest risk.\n\nI'll choose Scissors.

But they might also expect me to finally wise up and choose Rock.\n\nI'm going to commit to Rock. If they stick with their successful Paper, I get +3 points. If they switch to Scissors expecting Rock, I lose 1 point. I need to break this cycle where they keep beating my Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

I'm almost even now. My prediction was right - after losing with Paper, my opponent switched to Scissors, likely trying to counter an expected Rock from me. But I anticipated this and chose Paper to beat their Scissors.\n\nMy opponent's recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\nThey finally broke their Paper streak after the big loss in Round 10.\n\nFor Round 12, I need to consider:\n- They just lost with Scissors after abandoning their successful Paper strategy\n- They might go back to Paper (which worked for them for 4 rounds)\n- They might try Rock for the high-reward potential\n- They might expect me to stick with Paper and choose Scissors again\n\nGiven that they just lost trying to counter my expected Rock with Scissors, they might think I'll stick with Paper (since it just worked). If so, they might choose Scissors again to beat Paper, or go to Rock.\n\nHowever, they might also realize that going back to Paper (which worked so well for them) might be the smart move, especially since I just demonstrated I won't always choose Rock.\n\nI think there's a good chance they'll either try Scissors again (to beat what they think will be repeated Paper) or go back to Paper. If they choose Scissors, my Paper beats it. If they choose Paper, we tie.\n\nBut I should also consider Rock - if they go back to Paper, Rock gives me +3 points.\n\nI'll go with Rock. It's the high-reward play against Paper, and if they choose Scissors (thinking I'll repeat Paper), I only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Rock",

They chose Rock, same as me. After losing with Scissors in Round 11, they switched to Rock - possibly thinking I'd stick with Paper and they could get the high +3 reward. But I had the same idea about countering their potential return to Paper.\n\nWe've now had 6 ties out of 12 rounds, which is quite remarkable. This suggests we're thinking very similarly about the game dynamics.\n\nFor Round 13, after this Rock tie:\n- They might stick with Rock (it didn't lose)\n- They might expect me to counter Rock with Paper\n- They might cycle to something else\n- They could go back to their previously successful Paper strategy\n\nGiven that we just tied on Rock, and they know Rock carries high risk/reward, they might switch. If they think I'll choose Paper to counter Rock, they might choose Scissors. Or they might go back to Paper since it worked so well for them in rounds 7-10.\n\nI think after the Rock tie, they're more likely to switch than stick. Between Paper and Scissors, Paper was their most successful strategy recently. But they might also expect me to think this way and choose Scissors to counter expected Paper.\n\nI'll go with Scissors. If they return to Paper, I win. If they choose Rock thinking I'll go Paper, I lose only 1 point. If they choose Scissors, we tie.\n\n[move] Scissors",
