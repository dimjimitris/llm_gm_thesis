Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Or choose randomly without much thought\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock: I win +3 points (best case)\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Paper seems like a strong opening move because:\n   - It counters rock (which fresh players often choose)\n   - It gives the maximum possible points (+3) when successful\n   - The penalty if wrong is only -1 point (much better than the -3 penalty rock faces)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter a likely rock choice from the fresh player, aiming for the +3 point reward.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze opponent behavior: The opponent also chose paper in round 1, which suggests:\n   - They might have similar strategic thinking (paper counters rock)\n   - They could be thinking defensively \n   - Or they might continue with paper again\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper (thinking it worked as a safe choice)\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper)\n   - They might go to scissors (random change)\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays paper: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper: I win +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If I play paper again: Likely another tie if they repeat\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock gives +3 if opponent plays paper again, but -3 if they switch to scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 if opponent plays paper, but -1 if they play rock\n   - Paper gives 0 if they repeat, +3 if they go rock, -1 if they go scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision: Since the opponent played paper last round, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it or think I'll stick with paper. Rock offers the highest reward (+3) against paper, and the opponent showing paper last round makes this a calculated risk worth taking.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to potentially get +3 points if they repeat paper.\n\n[move] rock"

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (following S-R pattern): I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If opponent breaks the pattern: Could be paper or rock\n   - Rock beats scissors with maximum reward\n\n5. Consider opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They might stick with the S-R alternation that's been working\n   - Or they might think I've figured out their pattern and switch\n   - But the pattern is relatively new (only 4 rounds) so they might continue\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The S-R-S-R pattern is clear and recent\n   - Following this logic, scissors is the most likely next move\n   - Rock gives me +3 points against scissors\n   - Even if wrong, my +5 point lead provides a buffer\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the opponent continuing their established S-R alternating pattern with scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they're returning to pairs strategy: Another Rock (making RRR)\n   - If they break the Rock streak: Could go to Scissors or Paper\n   - Their historical preference shows they like consistent patterns\n\n5. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays Rock again: Paper gives +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: Rock gives +3 points\n   - If opponent plays Paper: Scissors gives +1 point\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent just played Rock twice in a row after a brief Paper appearance\n   - This resembles their original pairs strategy (PP-RR-PP)\n   - If they're returning to pairs, they might continue with Rock\n   - Paper gives maximum reward against Rock\n   - My +4 point lead provides good buffer for this strategic bet\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting that the opponent is returning to their pairs strategy and will play rock for a third consecutive time.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent plays paper (expecting me to play rock): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock (trying to counter scissors again): I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors (copying my last move): I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper gives me +3 points against rock, 0 against paper, -1 against scissors\n   - The opponent just played rock, and there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it or think I'll play rock next\n   - Paper offers the highest reward potential (+3) if they play rock again\n\n6. Strategic decision: Since the opponent switched to rock last round (adapting), they might stick with rock thinking it's a good counter strategy, or expect me to play rock next in a perceived cycle.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially get +3 points if they stick with or return to rock.\n\n[move] paper",

So if opponent played rock and I played paper, I should lose -3 points. That's correct.\n\n3. Corrected total: I have +2 - 3 = -1 points overall\n\n4. Analyze opponent's most recent pattern:\n   - Last 8 rounds: Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock\n   - Clear S-R alternation pattern has emerged again\n\n5. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - Following the S-R alternation: After Rock, Scissors should be next\n   - If they play Scissors: I should play Rock (+3 points)\n   - This alternation has been their most consistent pattern\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has returned to clear S-R alternation\n   - They just played Rock (round 22), so Scissors is next logically\n   - Rock beats Scissors for +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - I need to recover from my -1 point deficit\n   - The S-R pattern has been their strongest and most reliable pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting on the opponent's established scissors-rock alternation continuing with scissors.\n\n[move] rock",

Analyze opponent's most recent pattern:\n   - Last 9 rounds: Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock\n   - The S-R alternation broke when opponent played Rock twice (rounds 22-23)\n\n3. Look for current trends:\n   - The opponent has now played Rock in back-to-back rounds (22-23)\n   - This breaks their S-R alternation pattern\n   - Rock frequency is very high: appeared in rounds 17, 18, 20, 22, 23\n\n4. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - If they continue with Rock (third in a row): I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If they return to alternation (S after RR): I should play Rock (+3 points)\n   - If they're establishing a new RR pairs pattern: Continue with Rock\n\n5. Evaluate strategic probabilities:\n   - Rock has been extremely dominant recently\n   - The opponent just broke their alternation to play Rock twice\n   - This suggests Rock might be their new preferred strategy\n   - They've shown preference for playing moves in pairs historically\n\n6. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent has played Rock in 5 of the last 7 rounds\n   - They just played Rock twice in a row, breaking their alternation\n   - This strongly suggests Rock has become their dominant strategy\n   - Paper beats Rock for maximum +3 points\n   - I need to recover from my -1 point deficit, so high-reward moves are important\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, capitalizing on the opponent's clear shift toward favoring rock as their primary strategy.\n\n[move] paper",

Let me think about this differently:\n\nIf I assume they play each move with some probability based on their history:\n- Paper: ~44% (4/9)\n- Rock: ~44% (4/9) \n- Scissors: ~11% (1/9)\n\nAgainst this distribution:\n- If I play rock: 44% chance of +3, 11% chance of -1, 44% chance of 0 = expected value of about +1.2\n- If I play paper: 11% chance of +1, 44% chance of -3, 44% chance of 0 = expected value of about -1.2\n- If I play scissors: 44% chance of +1, 44% chance of -1, 11% chance of 0 = expected value of about 0\n\nRock has the highest expected value based on their historical play pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

But this scissors play might indicate they're trying to be less predictable, or they anticipated my rock play.\n\nLooking at this from their perspective: if they noticed I play rock frequently (which I have been), scissors would counter that. But scissors is risky since it only gives +1 when it wins.\n\nGiven they just played scissors (rare for them), they might:\n1. Go back to their preferred paper/rock pattern\n2. Continue mixing things up\n3. Play scissors again (very unlikely)\n\nI think they'll return to paper or rock.
