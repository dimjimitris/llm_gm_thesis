Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Opponent psychology assessment:\n   - They seem to have a very strong paper bias that overrides strategic thinking\n   - They adapt briefly but quickly fall back to their preferred move\n   - They're not learning from the repeated -3 point losses to rock\n   - This suggests either stubbornness, comfort with paper, or poor pattern recognition\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Their paper preference is so dominant that rock continues to be optimal\n   - Even when they \"adapt,\" they quickly revert to paper\n   - The 71% paper rate with immediate return after deviation suggests high confidence in continuing with rock\n\n6. Risk assessment for next round:\n   - If they stick with paper (very likely): Rock gives +3 points\n   - If they adapt with scissors again: Rock loses -1 point\n   - If they try rock: Tie at 0 points\n   - The probability heavily favors paper based on their pattern\n\n7. With my strong position (+6 points) and their demonstrated inability to sustain strategic changes, rock remains the optimal exploit.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue exploiting their paper preference with rock.\n\n[move] (They immediately returned to paper after their brief scissors adaptation, confirming their overwhelming paper bias. Rock continues to be the optimal counter) rock\n"

Strategic analysis of their play:\n   - They played scissors 3 times in a row while I countered with paper\n   - They absorbed -2 points (loss, tie, loss) to test my pattern\n   - Then they switched to rock to punish my predictable paper play (-3 points to me)\n   - This shows sophisticated strategic thinking - sacrificing short-term points for long-term advantage\n\n4.
