Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Consider what the tie might indicate:\n   - We both chose paper, suggesting similar thinking\n   - They might be sticking with paper longer this time\n   - Or they might switch after this extended paper run\n\n4. Look for patterns in their switching behavior:\n   - They played paper twice, then switched to scissors\n   - They played scissors twice, then switched to rock\n   - They played rock once, then switched back to paper\n   - They've now played paper three times in a row\n\n5. Consider my opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might expect me to play rock (since rock beats paper and I've won with rock twice)\n   - They could switch to scissors to counter expected rock\n   - They might continue with paper if they think I'll avoid rock\n   - The tie might make them want to change their approach\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - I'm still well ahead at +5 points\n   - I can afford moderate risks but should avoid the -3 penalty if possible\n   - Rock gives +3 vs paper but -1 vs scissors\n   - Scissors gives +1 vs rock but -1 vs paper\n\n7. Given that they've played paper three times in a row and might be due for a switch, and considering they might expect me to play rock, I think they'll likely play scissors to counter. I'll play paper to beat scissors.\n\n[move] (Expecting they'll switch to scissors after the extended paper run, playing paper to counter) paper"

Analyze the critical situation:\n   - My score has collapsed from +6 to 0 points\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 5 rounds\n   - My opponent's sequence: Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - Recent pattern: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Recognize the opponent's strategy:\n   - They're successfully counter-playing my moves\n   - Last 5 moves: Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors - they're cycling through all moves\n   - They seem to be anticipating my choices and countering effectively\n\n4. Analyze their recent counter-pattern:\n   - When I played scissors \u2192 they played paper\n   - When I played rock \u2192 they played scissors  \n   - They might expect me to play paper next (completing my cycle)\n   - If so, they might play rock to counter paper\n\n5. Consider the meta-strategy:\n   - My predictive approach has completely failed\n   - They've adapted to counter my strategic thinking\n   - I need to either be truly random or find their new pattern\n\n6. Look at their last few moves more carefully:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors (rounds 13-15)\n   - This could be them cycling: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - If they continue this cycle, next would be Rock again\n\n7. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - I'm tied at 0 points - no longer ahead\n   - I need to stop the losing streak immediately\n   - Conservative play vs aggressive play considerations\n\n8. Consider their likely next move:\n   - If they continue Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle: Rock comes next\n   - If they counter-expect me to play paper: they play rock\n   - Both scenarios suggest they'll play rock\n\n9. If they play rock, I should play scissors for +1. Given the pattern evidence and my desperate need to stop losing, I'll go with scissors.\n\n[move] (Breaking my losing streak by playing scissors, anticipating they'll continue their Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle with rock next) scissors"

Analyze my opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock\n   - Recent pattern clearly shows: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock (rounds 13-16)\n   - This appears to be a Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n\n3.

Consider why this pattern emerged:\n   - After being highly unpredictable, they might have settled into this simple cycle\n   - They successfully used it for several rounds\n   - They might continue it or break it if they think I've noticed\n\n5. Assess the strategic situation:\n   - I'm back to +1 point after being at 0\n   - I successfully predicted their last move\n   - I need to build on this momentum\n\n6. Analyze their perspective:\n   - They might not realize they've fallen into a predictable cycle\n   - They might expect me to not notice the pattern\n   - They could break the pattern if they suspect I've caught on\n\n7. Evaluate my options if they play paper next:\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points (high reward)\n   - Scissors loses to paper for -1 point\n   - Paper ties with paper for 0 points\n\n8. Consider the risk/reward:\n   - Rock gives the maximum reward (+3) if they continue the cycle\n   - The risk is moderate (-1) if they play scissors instead\n   - Given that I just broke my losing streak, I should capitalize aggressively\n\n9.

Confirm my opponent's cycling pattern:\n   - Their sequence: Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - Recent clear cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper (rounds 13-17)\n   - The pattern is Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors repeating\n\n3.

Assess the situation:\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds for +4 points total\n   - My score has improved from 0 to +4 points\n   - I've successfully identified and exploited their pattern\n\n5. Consider their perspective:\n   - They might not realize they're in a predictable cycle\n   - They've been following this pattern for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - They might break the pattern if they suspect I've caught on\n\n6. Evaluate the risk of pattern continuation:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Paper beats scissors for +1\n   - If they break pattern to rock: Scissors beats rock for +1  \n   - If they break pattern to paper: Rock beats paper for +3\n\n7. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - Paper is safe against expected scissors (+1) and only loses -3 to rock\n   - Scissors wins against rock (+1) but loses to paper (-1)\n   - Rock has highest upside (+3) against paper but loses to scissors (-1)\n\n8. Consider the probability they'll break the pattern:\n   - They've been consistent for 5 rounds\n   - Breaking patterns often happens when players feel they're being read\n   - But they might not be consciously aware of their cycle\n\n9.

Consider why they might have changed:\n   - They might have realized they were in a predictable cycle\n   - They could be adapting after I successfully exploited their pattern\n   - The tie might have been coincidental or intentional pattern-breaking\n\n4. Look at their current sequence:\n   - Recent moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This could start a new pattern or be a temporary deviation\n\n5. Assess their likely next move:\n   - If they return to the cycle: should be scissors\n   - If they continue with paper: would be paper again\n   - If they're being unpredictable: could be anything\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - I'm still ahead at +4 points\n   - I maintained my lead despite the tie\n   - They might be trying to counter-adapt to my successful predictions\n\n7.

Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They successfully broke their predictable cycle when I was exploiting it\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or return to randomness\n   - They could be testing if I'll continue trying to predict patterns\n\n5. Assess the current situation:\n   - My score dropped from +4 to +3 points\n   - I'm still ahead but the gap could close quickly\n   - They've shown they can adapt when being exploited\n\n6.

            "text": "I need to analyze this alarming trend and make a crucial strategic decision for round 22.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the complete game history:\n   - Current total score: +1 point (down from +4 just 4 rounds ago)\n   - I've now lost 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - My opponent has played paper in rounds 17, 18, 20, and 21\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Last 5 moves: Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper\n   - They're heavily favoring paper (4 out of 5 recent moves)\n   - This could be a new strategy or coincidental\n\n3. Recognize the critical pattern:\n   - Round 17: Rock vs Paper \u2192 I won +3\n   - Round 18: Paper vs Paper \u2192 Tie 0  \n   - Round 19: Rock vs Scissors \u2192 I lost -1\n   - Round 20: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 I lost -1\n   - Round 21: Scissors vs Paper \u2192 I lost -1\n\n4. Notice their paper dominance:\n   - They've played paper 4 times in the last 5 rounds\n   - Paper beats scissors (which I've been playing)\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points\n\n5. Assess the situation:\n   - My lead has collapsed from +4 to +1\n   - They seem to have identified that I'm overthinking\n   - Simple strategies might be beating complex ones\n\n6. Consider why they're playing so much paper:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors frequently\n   - Paper is effective against scissors\n   - They could be simplifying their strategy\n\n7. Analyze the meta-game:\n   - My pattern-recognition approach worked initially but failed as they adapted\n   - They might be using a simpler, more effective strategy\n   - Sometimes the obvious move is the right move\n\n8. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they continue with paper: Rock wins +3, Scissors loses -1, Paper ties 0\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins +1, Rock loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors wins +1, Paper loses -3, Rock ties 0\n\n9. Given their heavy paper usage (4 out of 5 recent rounds) and that rock beats paper for the maximum +3 points, I need to take this high-value opportunity. My lead is too slim to play conservatively.\n\n[move] (Taking the high-value opportunity against their paper-heavy strategy) rock"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Current total score: +4 points (back up from the dangerous +1)\n   - I just won +3 points with rock vs paper\n   - My opponent has now played paper 5 out of the last 6 rounds\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's recent paper strategy:\n   - Round 17: Paper\n   - Round 18: Paper  \n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Paper\n   - Round 21: Paper\n   - Round 22: Paper\n   - They're clearly favoring paper heavily\n\n3. Consider why this paper strategy emerged:\n   - Paper beats scissors, and I was playing scissors frequently\n   - They might have found a simple effective strategy\n   - Or they could be setting up a pattern to break when I catch on\n\n4. Assess their likely reasoning:\n   - They might continue with paper since it's been working\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (since it just won big)\n   - They could switch to scissors to counter expected rock\n\n5. Analyze the strategic situation:\n   - I'm back to a healthy +4 lead\n   - I successfully identified their paper preference\n   - They might adapt now that I've countered it\n\n6. Consider their perspective after losing:\n   - They just lost -3 points, a significant hit\n   - They might abandon the paper strategy\n   - They could switch to scissors to counter future rock plays\n\n7. Evaluate the probabilities:\n   - If they continue with paper: Rock wins +3 again\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins +1, Rock loses -1\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors wins +1, Paper loses -3\n\n8. Analyze the risk/reward:\n   - Rock: High reward (+3) vs paper, moderate risk (-1) vs scissors\n   - Paper: Moderate reward (+1) vs scissors, high risk (-3) vs rock\n   - Scissors: Moderate reward (+1) vs rock, low risk (-1) vs paper\n\n9. Given that they might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock play, and that paper beats scissors while having manageable risk, I'll play paper. This covers against their likely adaptation while maintaining good position.\n\n[move] (Expecting they might switch to scissors to counter my successful rock strategy, playing paper to stay ahead) paper"

Review the complete game history:\n   - Current total score: +5 points (up from +4)\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds for +4 points total\n   - My opponent's recent sequence: Paper, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors\n\n2. Analyze my successful predictions:\n   - Round 22: I predicted paper (after their paper-heavy strategy) \u2192 played rock \u2192 won +3\n   - Round 23: I predicted scissors (as counter to my rock) \u2192 played paper \u2192 won +1\n   - I'm successfully reading their adaptations\n\n3. Consider their recent pattern:\n   - They played paper heavily (5 out of 6 rounds)\n   - Then switched to scissors (likely to counter my rock)\n   - They're showing adaptive behavior\n\n4. Assess their likely next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors vs my paper\n   - They might return to paper (their recent favorite)\n   - They might try rock (to counter expected paper)\n   - They might continue with scissors\n\n5. Analyze their strategic position:\n   - They've lost 2 rounds in a row for -4 points\n   - They're likely behind by a significant margin\n   - They might take more risks or try new strategies\n\n6. Consider the psychological aspect:\n   - I've successfully countered their last two moves\n   - They might think I'm reading them well\n   - They could try to be more unpredictable\n\n7. Look at the meta-game:\n   - My recent success came from reading their adaptations\n   - They adapted from paper-heavy to scissors\n   - Next adaptation might be to rock (beating paper)\n\n8. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins +1, Paper loses -3, Rock ties 0\n   - If they return to paper: Rock wins +3, Scissors loses -1, Paper ties 0\n   - If they continue scissors: Paper wins +1, Rock loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n\n9. Given my strong position (+5 points) and that they might try rock to counter my successful paper play, I'll play scissors. This wins against rock, has minimal risk against paper (-1), and ties with scissors. It's a balanced choice that protects my lead while maintaining winning potential.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they might switch to rock to counter my successful paper play, choosing scissors for balanced coverage) scissors"
