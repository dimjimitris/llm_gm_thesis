Scissors beats paper for +1 point and also covers rock if they switch strategies.\n"

          "text": "Let me think through this step-by-step to develop a winning strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (vs -3 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (vs -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Have slight tendencies toward certain moves (rock is psychologically popular as it seems \"strong\")\n   - May not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Given the payoff structure, rock is high-risk/high-reward. If I can predict when my opponent might choose paper, rock becomes very costly (-3 points).\n\n5.

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 3 times in the last 4 rounds\n   - The alternating pattern I thought I saw was wrong - they're heavily favoring scissors now!\n\n3. Strategic shift recognition:\n   - Phase 1 (rounds 1-5): Heavy paper preference\n   - Phase 2 (rounds 6-9): Heavy scissors preference (3 out of 4 rounds)\n   - They've completely flipped their strategy to counter my persistent rock play\n   - This is a major strategic adaptation!\n\n4. Current situation assessment:\n   - I've been playing rock repeatedly (6 out of last 7 rounds)\n   - They've recognized this pattern and shifted to scissors to counter it\n   - My rock strategy is now being consistently beaten\n   - I need to adapt or continue losing points\n\n5. Counter-adaptation options:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n   - If they try rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - They've clearly identified my rock pattern and are countering with scissors\n   - Playing rock again would likely result in another loss to scissors\n   - Paper is the direct counter to their current scissors preference\n   - This breaks my predictable rock pattern while exploiting their new pattern\n\n7. I need to abandon my rock strategy since they've successfully adapted to counter it. Paper is the logical response to their scissors focus.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Switch to paper to counter their new scissors-heavy strategy.\n\n[move] (My opponent has shifted from paper preference to scissors preference, clearly countering my repeated rock plays.

Correction - I WON round 10:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Paper beats scissors, so I should have won +1 point\n   - But the hint says I scored 1 point, which confirms I won\n\n3. Recent opponent pattern:\n   - Last 5 rounds: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times in the last 5 rounds\n   - Their scissors preference is very strong now\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - They've completely abandoned their original paper preference\n   - They're now heavily committed to scissors (likely to counter my previous rock pattern)\n   - My switch to paper successfully countered their scissors\n   - They might continue with scissors or potentially adapt again\n\n5. Opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They just lost to my paper with their scissors\n   - They might think I'll continue with paper and counter with rock\n   - Or they might stick with scissors thinking I'll go back to rock\n   - Or they might try to return to their original paper preference\n\n6. My strategic options:\n   - If they stick with scissors: Paper beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: Scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n   - If they return to paper: Rock beats paper (+3 points)\n\n7. Given their strong recent scissors preference (4 out of 5 rounds) and the fact that one successful counter doesn't usually break a strong pattern immediately, I expect they'll likely play scissors again. Paper remains the optimal counter.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper to exploit their scissors preference.\n\n[move] (My opponent has played scissors 4 out of the last 5 rounds, showing a strong commitment to this strategy.

Wait - there's an error in my understanding:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - Rock beats scissors, so I should have WON +1 point, not lost -1\n   - But the hint says I lost and scored -1 points\n   - Let me recheck the rules: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So scissors BEATS rock!
