First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also gives the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Paper.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - Fresh players often default to Rock as it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Paper to get +3 points\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Given the high reward for Rock beating Paper (+3 points), and considering that many beginners might choose Paper or Rock, playing Rock could be a good opening move.\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - If opponent plays Paper: I lose 3 points (bad)\n   - If opponent plays Rock: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I win 1 point (good)\n\n6. However, playing Paper is safer against a potentially Rock-heavy opponent:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: I win 3 points (excellent)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I lose 1 point (minor loss)\n\nGiven the high reward potential and the likelihood of a fresh player choosing Rock, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I played Paper, opponent played Scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (Paper loses to Scissors, giving -1 points)\n   - Wait, the hint says I \"won the round\" and \"scored 1 points\" - this seems contradictory to the rules\n\n2. Let me re-check the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So Paper does beat Scissors, giving me +1 point\n   - The hint is correct - I won and scored 1 point\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose Scissors in round 1\n   - This suggests they might not be defaulting to Rock as I initially thought\n   - They could be playing randomly or have a different strategy\n\n4. For round 2 strategy:\n   - My opponent played Scissors last round\n   - They might stick with Scissors, switch to avoid my Paper, or play randomly\n   - If they think I'll play Paper again, they might switch to Scissors again (but they already did that)\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might try Rock or Paper\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) if it wins against Paper\n   - If opponent switches to Paper (thinking I'll repeat Paper), then I should play Scissors\n   - If opponent switches to Rock (trying to counter Paper), then I should play Paper again\n   - If opponent sticks with Scissors, then Paper wins again\n\n6. Given that my Paper just beat their Scissors, they're likely to avoid Scissors this round. They'll probably try Rock or Paper. Rock seems more likely as a counter to Paper.\n\nI'll play Paper again, betting they'll try Rock to counter my previous Paper move.\n\n[move] Paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3)\n   - Round 3: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 4: I played Scissors, opponent played Paper \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 6: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 7: I played Paper, opponent played Rock \u2192 I lost (-3)\n   - Round 8: I played Paper, opponent played Paper \u2192 Tie (0)\n   - Round 9: I played Rock, opponent played Paper \u2192 I won (+3)\n   - Current total: 1 + (-3) + 1 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 + (-3) + 0 + 3 = -2 points\n\n2. Opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Critical breakthrough analysis:\n   - My switch to Rock was successful - they played Paper\n   - This confirms they were trying to counter my Paper pattern\n   - They expected me to continue with Paper and played Paper to counter my expected Rock counter\n   - Breaking my pattern worked perfectly\n\n4. Current situation assessment:\n   - I just won +3 points, significantly improving my position\n   - I'm now only -2 points instead of -5\n   - The opponent just lost with Paper to my Rock\n\n5. Opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with Paper to my Rock\n   - Based on their previous pattern, they often try to counter my winning moves\n   - They might switch to Scissors (to beat Rock if I repeat it)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from Rock and play something else\n\n6. Strategic considerations for Round 10:\n   - If they play Scissors (expecting me to repeat Rock), I should play Rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play Rock (copying my winning move), I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play Paper again, I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Pattern-breaking vs. exploitation:\n   - I successfully broke their prediction by switching to Rock\n   - Now I need to decide: exploit their likely counter to Rock, or continue being unpredictable\n   - They've shown they counter winning moves, so they might play Scissors\n\nGiven their pattern of countering my winning moves and that Rock just won big for me, they're likely to play Scissors to counter a potential Rock repeat. I'll play Rock again to beat their expected Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1-9: Previous rounds ending with current total of -2 points\n   - Round 10: I played Rock, opponent played Scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Current total: -2 + (-1) = -3 points\n\n2. Opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Critical analysis of Round 10:\n   - I predicted they'd play Scissors to counter my Rock - I was RIGHT about their move\n   - BUT I made a fundamental error: Scissors BEATS Rock, not the other way around!\n   - I confused the rules: Rock beats Scissors, but Scissors beats Rock\n   - My prediction was correct, but my counter-move was wrong\n\n4. Rules clarification check:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1 points)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3 points) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1 points)\n   - So if opponent plays Scissors, I should play Rock... wait, that's wrong\n   - Actually: Rock beats Scissors, so if they play Scissors, Rock should win\n   - Let me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So Scissors beats Rock! I had it backwards.\n\n5. Correct rule understanding:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper  \n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - It's like Rock-Paper-Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock\n   - Wait, that's the traditional game, but here it says \"scissors beats rock\"\n\n6. Re-reading the rules carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So in THIS game: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper (cycle)\n\n7. Strategy for Round 11:\n   - They just won with Scissors\n   - Following their pattern, they might switch to counter my expected move\n   - If they expect me to play Paper (to beat Scissors), they might play Scissors again\n   - If they expect me to switch randomly, they might play Rock or Paper\n   - To beat Scissors, I need Paper\n\nGiven they just won with Scissors and might repeat it (or expect me to counter with Paper), I'll play Paper to beat their potential Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

Critical pattern observation:\n   - Looking at their last few moves: Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - After winning with Scissors (Round 10), they switched to Rock (Round 11)\n   - After winning with Rock (Round 11), what will they do in Round 12?\n\n4. Win-loss pattern analysis for opponent:\n   - When they win, they often switch moves next round\n   - Round 10: Won with Scissors \u2192 Round 11: Switched to Rock\n   - Round 7: Won with Rock \u2192 Round 8: Switched to Paper\n   - Round 2: Won with Rock \u2192 Round 3: Repeated Rock (exception)\n\n5. My losing streak analysis:\n   - I'm losing badly because I'm not reading their adaptation correctly\n   - They seem to be countering my attempts to counter them\n   - I need a different approach\n\n6. Strategic reset for Round 12:\n   - They just won with Rock (beating my Paper)\n   - Based on pattern, they might switch away from Rock\n   - If they switch to Scissors, I should play Rock\n   - If they switch to Paper, I should play Scissors\n   - If they repeat Rock, I should play Paper\n\n7. Simplified decision matrix:\n   - Against Scissors: Play Rock (+1 if I'm right, but wait... Scissors beats Rock!)\n   - Against Paper: Play Scissors (+1)\n   - Against Rock: Play Paper (+3)\n\n8. Rule check again:\n   - Scissors beats Rock (opponent gets +1, I get -1)\n   - So to beat Scissors, I need Paper\n   - To beat Paper, I need Scissors  \n   - To beat Rock, I need Paper\n\nGiven they just won with Rock and tend to switch after winning, plus the fact that Scissors and Paper are both possible switches, I'll go with Scissors to beat Paper (which seems like a logical switch from Rock).\n\n[move] Scissors"

New observations:\n   - Round 18 tie suggests we might be thinking similarly now\n   - They've used Rock twice, Scissors once, Paper once in last 4 rounds\n   - No clear pattern emerging\n\n5. Strategic considerations for Round 19:\n   - They just played Paper (tied with mine)\n   - After ties, their behavior is less predictable from my limited data\n   - They might switch away from Paper, repeat it, or play randomly\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - I successfully exploited their counter-pattern for 4 rounds\n   - They adapted and broke that pattern\n   - Now we're in a more random/unpredictable phase\n   - I need to think about what gives me the best expected value\n\n7. Expected value analysis:\n   - Rock: +3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n   - Paper: +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper  \n   - Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n\n8. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - If they're playing more randomly now, Rock has the highest upside (+3)\n   - But also the highest downside when wrong (-1 vs Scissors)\n   - Paper is more conservative but has severe downside vs Rock (-3)\n   - Scissors is most balanced: +1 best case, -1 worst case\n\nGiven the unpredictable phase we're in and wanting to balance risk/reward, I'll go with Scissors for its balanced payoff structure.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock  \n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Key observation:\n   - They played Rock in both Round 17 and Round 19\n   - Rock appears frequently in their recent play\n   - They seem to favor Rock when being unpredictable\n\n4. Strategic question for Round 20:\n   - Will they revert to their old counter-pattern behavior?\n   - I just won with Scissors in Round 19\n   - If they go back to countering, they should play Paper (which beats Scissors)\n   - If they continue random/Rock-heavy play, they might play Rock again\n\n5. Decision matrix:\n   - If they play Paper (counter-pattern): I should play Scissors... wait, Paper beats Scissors\n   - Actually, if they play Paper, I should play Rock (+3 points)\n   - If they play Rock (continuing Rock-heavy trend): I should play Paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they play Scissors: I should play Rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Pattern probability assessment:\n   - Counter-pattern (Paper): Moderate probability - they showed this before\n   - Rock-heavy (Rock): Moderate probability - they played Rock twice recently\n   - Random (Scissors): Lower probability - less frequent lately\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock: Beats Paper (+3), beats Scissors (+1), loses to Rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Rock (-3), ties Paper (0)\n   - Both Rock and Paper could yield +3 points in different scenarios\n\n8. Strategic choice:\n   - Paper beats Rock for +3 points (their frequent recent choice)\n   - Rock beats Paper for +3 points (if they counter my Scissors)\n   - Given they played Rock twice in last 4 rounds, Paper seems like the better bet\n\nI'll play Paper to capitalize on their Rock-heavy tendency for the +3 bonus.\n\n[move] Paper"

Interesting pattern observation:\n   - Round 16: Scissors, Round 20: Scissors (4 rounds apart)\n   - Round 17: Rock, Round 19: Rock (2 rounds apart)\n   - They might be cycling: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - If this 5-move cycle continues, next should be Rock\n\n4. Alternative analysis:\n   - They played Scissors in Round 20 (just lost to my Paper)\n   - Are they back to counter-pattern behavior?\n   - I won with Paper, so counter-pattern would be Rock next round\n   - This aligns with the cycle theory (Rock should be next)\n\n5. Prediction for Round 21:\n   - Both cycle theory and counter-pattern suggest Rock\n   - High confidence they'll play Rock\n\n6.

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also gives the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Paper.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - Fresh players often default to Rock as it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Paper to get +3 points\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Given the high reward for Rock beating Paper (+3 points), and considering that many beginners might choose Paper or Rock, playing Rock could be a good opening move.\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - If opponent plays Paper: I lose 3 points (bad)\n   - If opponent plays Rock: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I win 1 point (good)\n\n6. However, playing Paper is safer against a potentially Rock-heavy opponent:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: I win 3 points (excellent)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I lose 1 point (minor loss)\n\nGiven the high reward potential and the likelihood of a fresh player choosing Rock, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper",

Opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - This looks like they might be cycling: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - Round 1: Scissors\n   - Round 2: Rock (after losing to my Paper)\n   - Round 3: Rock (repeated)\n   - Round 4: Paper (after losing to my Scissors)\n   - Round 5: Scissors (cycling back?)\n\n4. If there's a cycle pattern emerging:\n   - Next move might be Rock (following the Scissors \u2192 Rock pattern from rounds 1-2)\n   - Or they might repeat Scissors (since it just worked)\n\n5. My losing streak analysis:\n   - I've lost 3 of the last 4 rounds\n   - I need to break this pattern and start winning\n   - My strategy of trying to predict their moves isn't working well\n\n6. Counter-strategy options for Round 6:\n   - If they play Rock next (following potential cycle), I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If they repeat Scissors (since it worked), I should play Rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play Paper, I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper gives highest reward (+3) if they play Rock\n   - Paper only loses 1 point if they play Scissors\n   - Paper ties (0 points) if they play Paper\n\nGiven the potential cycle pattern and that Rock followed Scissors in round 2 after Scissors in round 1, I predict they'll play Rock next. I'll counter with Paper for the +3 reward.\n\n[move] Paper",

New analysis needed:\n   - They played Scissors twice in a row (Rounds 14 and 16)\n   - Maybe they're shifting to repeating moves instead of countering\n   - Or they're trying to be unpredictable now\n\n6. Strategy for Round 17:\n   - They just played Scissors and won\n   - If they're back to their old pattern, they might switch after winning\n   - If they're repeating, they might play Scissors again\n   - If they're being random, any move is possible\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Against Scissors: Play Paper (+1 point)\n   - Against Rock: Play Paper (+3 points)\n   - Against Paper: Play Scissors (+1 point)\n   - Paper covers 2 of 3 scenarios well\n\n8. Meta-consideration:\n   - My 4-round winning streak may have forced them to adapt\n   - I need to be more unpredictable myself now\n   - Paper is a solid choice that performs well in most scenarios\n\nGiven that they broke their predictable pattern and I need to adapt to their new unpredictability, I'll play Paper as it gives good results against both Scissors (+1) and Rock (+3), with only a moderate loss against Paper (+0 tie, not -1).\n\nWait, let me double-check: Paper vs Paper is a tie (0 points), Paper vs Scissors gives me +1, Paper vs Rock gives me... actually Rock beats Paper, so I'd get -3.

Notice the asymmetry: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't know my strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - Have no established pattern to predict\n\n4. Given that fresh players tend to favor rock, and scissors beats rock for +1 points while rock beats paper for +3 points, I should consider:\n   - If they play rock, my scissors wins +1\n   - If they play paper, my scissors loses -1\n   - If they play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Since rock has the highest penalty risk (-3) and fresh players might expect others to play rock, I'll avoid rock initially.\n\n6. Between paper and scissors, scissors seems better against a potentially rock-heavy opponent.\n\n[move] (I'll start with scissors, anticipating the opponent might choose rock as many new players do) scissors"

Analyze my opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock\n   - Updated pattern: Paper(2) \u2192 Scissors(2) \u2192 Rock(1) \u2192 Paper(3) \u2192 Rock(2 so far)\n   - They're now playing rock for the second consecutive time\n\n3. Consider their clustering behavior:\n   - They've consistently played moves in groups\n   - They just played rock twice in a row\n   - Based on their previous patterns, they might switch after 2-3 rocks, or continue\n\n4. Look at their switching points:\n   - After 2 papers \u2192 switched to scissors\n   - After 2 scissors \u2192 switched to rock  \n   - After 1 rock \u2192 switched to paper\n   - After 3 papers \u2192 switched to rock\n   - After 2 rocks \u2192 ?\n\n5. Consider my opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might continue with rock (making it 3 in a row)\n   - They might switch to paper or scissors after 2 rocks\n   - They saw me successfully counter their rock with scissors twice now\n\n6. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors wins +1, Paper loses -3, Rock ties 0\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins +1, Rock loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins +3, Scissors loses -1, Paper ties 0\n\n7. Consider the risks and rewards:\n   - Scissors is safe against rock (+1) but vulnerable to paper (-1)\n   - Rock is high reward against paper (+3) but high risk against scissors (-1)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1) but has catastrophic loss to rock (-3)\n\n8. Given that they've played rock twice and I've beaten rock with scissors twice, they might switch to paper to counter my scissors. I'll play rock to potentially get the +3 reward against paper.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they might switch to paper to counter my successful scissors strategy) rock"

Consider the meta-strategy:\n   - My predictive approach has completely failed\n   - They've adapted to counter my strategic thinking\n   - I need to either be truly random or find their new pattern\n\n6. Look at their last few moves more carefully:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors (rounds 13-15)\n   - This could be them cycling: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - If they continue this cycle, next would be Rock again\n\n7.

Confirm my opponent's cycling pattern:\n   - Their sequence: Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper\n   - Recent clear cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper (rounds 13-17)\n   - The pattern is Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors repeating\n\n3. Predict their next move:\n   - Round 13: Rock\n   - Round 14: Paper\n   - Round 15: Scissors  \n   - Round 16: Rock\n   - Round 17: Paper\n   - If continuing the cycle: Round 18 should be Scissors\n\n4. Assess the situation:\n   - I've won the last 2 rounds for +4 points total\n   - My score has improved from 0 to +4 points\n   - I've successfully identified and exploited their pattern\n\n5. Consider their perspective:\n   - They might not realize they're in a predictable cycle\n   - They've been following this pattern for 5 consecutive rounds\n   - They might break the pattern if they suspect I've caught on\n\n6. Evaluate the risk of pattern continuation:\n   - If they continue with scissors: Paper beats scissors for +1\n   - If they break pattern to rock: Scissors beats rock for +1  \n   - If they break pattern to paper: Rock beats paper for +3\n\n7. Analyze my strategic options:\n   - Paper is safe against expected scissors (+1) and only loses -3 to rock\n   - Scissors wins against rock (+1) but loses to paper (-1)\n   - Rock has highest upside (+3) against paper but loses to scissors (-1)\n\n8. Consider the probability they'll break the pattern:\n   - They've been consistent for 5 rounds\n   - Breaking patterns often happens when players feel they're being read\n   - But they might not be consciously aware of their cycle\n\n9. Given the strong evidence for scissors next and that paper beats scissors while having reasonable outcomes against other moves, I'll play paper to continue capitalizing on their pattern.\n\n[move] (Expecting scissors to continue their Rock-Paper-Scissors cycle, playing paper for the win) paper"

Analyze what happened to the pattern:\n   - Expected cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Actual sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They broke the cycle by playing paper instead of scissors in round 18\n\n3. Consider why they might have changed:\n   - They might have realized they were in a predictable cycle\n   - They could be adapting after I successfully exploited their pattern\n   - The tie might have been coincidental or intentional pattern-breaking\n\n4. Look at their current sequence:\n   - Recent moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This could start a new pattern or be a temporary deviation\n\n5. Assess their likely next move:\n   - If they return to the cycle: should be scissors\n   - If they continue with paper: would be paper again\n   - If they're being unpredictable: could be anything\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - I'm still ahead at +4 points\n   - I maintained my lead despite the tie\n   - They might be trying to counter-adapt to my successful predictions\n\n7. Analyze my options:\n   - If they play scissors (returning to cycle): Paper wins +1\n   - If they play paper (continuing double): Rock wins +3\n   - If they play rock (new pattern): Scissors wins +1\n\n8. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) if they continue with paper\n   - Paper is safe against scissors (+1) with moderate downside (-3 vs rock)\n   - Scissors is balanced (+1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors)\n\n9. Given that they just broke their cycle and might be trying to be unpredictable, and considering they played paper twice, there's a chance they might continue with paper. I'll take the high-reward option with rock.\n\n[move] (Taking advantage of potential continued paper play after they broke their cycle) rock"

Look for new patterns:\n   - After breaking the cycle with double paper, they went back to scissors\n   - Could be: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 (break) \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - Or they might be reverting to the original Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They successfully broke their predictable cycle when I was exploiting it\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or return to randomness\n   - They could be testing if I'll continue trying to predict patterns\n\n5. Assess the current situation:\n   - My score dropped from +4 to +3 points\n   - I'm still ahead but the gap could close quickly\n   - They've shown they can adapt when being exploited\n\n6. Analyze their likely next move:\n   - If returning to Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle: next would be Rock\n   - If starting a new pattern from scissors: could be anything\n   - If being unpredictable: all moves equally likely\n\n7. Consider the meta-game:\n   - They've proven they can break patterns when needed\n   - I need to be more cautious about assuming patterns will continue\n   - They might expect me to be confused by the pattern break\n\n8. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins +1, Paper loses -3, Rock ties 0\n   - If they play paper: Rock wins +3, Scissors loses -1, Paper ties 0\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins +1, Rock loses -1, Scissors ties 0\n\n9. Given the uncertainty and my need to protect my lead, I'll choose scissors. It wins against rock (if they return to cycle), has minimal loss against paper (-1), and ties with scissors.

Analyze what happened to the pattern:\n   - Expected cycle: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Actual sequence: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They broke the cycle by playing paper instead of scissors in round 18\n\n3. Consider why they might have changed:\n   - They might have realized they were in a predictable cycle\n   - They could be adapting after I successfully exploited their pattern\n   - The tie might have been coincidental or intentional pattern-breaking\n\n4. Look at their current sequence:\n   - Recent moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This could start a new pattern or be a temporary deviation\n\n5. Assess their likely next move:\n   - If they return to the cycle: should be scissors\n   - If they continue with paper: would be paper again\n   - If they're being unpredictable: could be anything\n\n6. Consider the strategic implications:\n   - I'm still ahead at +4 points\n   - I maintained my lead despite the tie\n   - They might be trying to counter-adapt to my successful predictions\n\n7. Analyze my options:\n   - If they play scissors (returning to cycle): Paper wins +1\n   - If they play paper (continuing double): Rock wins +3\n   - If they play rock (new pattern): Scissors wins +1\n\n8. Evaluate the risk/reward:\n   - Rock has the highest upside (+3) if they continue with paper\n   - Paper is safe against scissors (+1) with moderate downside (-3 vs rock)\n   - Scissors is balanced (+1 vs rock, -1 vs paper, 0 vs scissors)\n\n9. Given that they just broke their cycle and might be trying to be unpredictable, and considering they played paper twice, there's a chance they might continue with paper. I'll take the high-reward option with rock.\n\n[move] (Taking advantage of potential continued paper play after they broke their cycle) rock",

Look for new patterns:\n   - After breaking the cycle with double paper, they went back to scissors\n   - Could be: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 (break) \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - Or they might be reverting to the original Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle\n\n4. Consider their strategic thinking:\n   - They successfully broke their predictable cycle when I was exploiting it\n   - They might be trying to establish a new pattern or return to randomness\n   - They could be testing if I'll continue trying to predict patterns\n\n5. Assess the current situation:\n   - My score dropped from +4 to +3 points\n   - I'm still ahead but the gap could close quickly\n   - They've shown they can adapt when being exploited\n\n6. Analyze their likely next move:\n   - If returning to Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors cycle: next would be Rock\n   - If starting a new pattern from scissors: could be anything\n   - If being unpredictable: all moves equally likely\n\n7. Consider the meta-game:\n   - They've proven they can break patterns when needed\n   - I need to be more cautious about assuming patterns will continue\n   - They might expect me to be confused by the pattern break\n\n8.
