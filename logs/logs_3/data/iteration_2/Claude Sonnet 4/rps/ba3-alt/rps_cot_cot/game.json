First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new or unpredictable), I need to consider what they might choose:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's commonly seen as \"strong\"\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is often overlooked by beginners\n\n4. Given the high reward for rock beating paper (+3 points), and considering that fresh players might avoid paper or choose rock, playing rock seems like a good risk/reward choice.\n\n5. If they play paper, I lose 3 points, but if they play scissors, I win 1 point. If they play rock, it's a tie.\n\n6. The potential for +3 points outweighs the other considerations for this first move against an unknown opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh,\" meaning they're new/inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often don't have developed strategies\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock as their first move (it's common/intuitive)\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - However, if opponent is likely to play rock (common for beginners), paper would win me 3 points\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since the opponent is fresh and rock is a common first choice for beginners\n   - Paper beats rock for the maximum 3-point reward\n   - This seems like the optimal play against an inexperienced opponent\n\n[move] paper\n"
