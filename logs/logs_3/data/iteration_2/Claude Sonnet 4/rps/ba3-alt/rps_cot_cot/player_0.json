    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also gives the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Paper.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider:\n   - Fresh players often default to Rock as it's commonly seen as the \"strongest\" move\n   - If they play Rock, I should play Paper to get +3 points\n   - However, they might also choose randomly\n\n4. Given the high reward for Rock beating Paper (+3 points), and considering that many beginners might choose Paper or Rock, playing Rock could be a good opening move.\n\n5. The risk-reward analysis:\n   - If opponent plays Paper: I lose 3 points (bad)\n   - If opponent plays Rock: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I win 1 point (good)\n\n6. However, playing Paper is safer against a potentially Rock-heavy opponent:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: I win 3 points (excellent)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points (neutral)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: I lose 1 point (minor loss)\n\nGiven the high reward potential and the likelihood of a fresh player choosing Rock, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I played Paper, opponent played Scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (Paper loses to Scissors, giving -1 points)\n   - Wait, the hint says I \"won the round\" and \"scored 1 points\" - this seems contradictory to the rules\n\n2. Let me re-check the rules:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So Paper does beat Scissors, giving me +1 point\n   - The hint is correct - I won and scored 1 point\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose Scissors in round 1\n   - This suggests they might not be defaulting to Rock as I initially thought\n   - They could be playing randomly or have a different strategy\n\n4. For round 2 strategy:\n   - My opponent played Scissors last round\n   - They might stick with Scissors, switch to avoid my Paper, or play randomly\n   - If they think I'll play Paper again, they might switch to Scissors again (but they already did that)\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might try Rock or Paper\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) if it wins against Paper\n   - If opponent switches to Paper (thinking I'll repeat Paper), then I should play Scissors\n   - If opponent switches to Rock (trying to counter Paper), then I should play Paper again\n   - If opponent sticks with Scissors, then Paper wins again\n\n6. Given that my Paper just beat their Scissors, they're likely to avoid Scissors this round. They'll probably try Rock or Paper. Rock seems more likely as a counter to Paper.\n\nI'll play Paper again, betting they'll try Rock to counter my previous Paper move.\n\n[move] Paper"

Opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They know I just played Paper three times (rounds 6, 7, 8)\n   - They might expect me to either:\n     a) Continue with Paper (showing I'm stubborn)\n     b) Switch away from Paper (showing I'm adaptive)\n\n6. Strategic considerations for Round 9:\n   - If they think I'll repeat Paper again, they'll play Rock\n   - If they think I'll switch to Scissors (to beat their expected Rock), they'll play Rock\n   - If they think I'll switch to Rock (random change), they'll play Paper\n   - The tie might make them more unpredictable\n\n7. Meta-level thinking:\n   - I've been playing Paper frequently and they've started to counter it\n   - I need to break this pattern\n   - Scissors hasn't been played by me since round 4-5\n   - Rock might be unexpected since I haven't used it recently\n\nGiven that I've played Paper three straight times and they're clearly trying to counter my patterns, I'll switch to Rock to break their expectations and potentially catch them off guard.\n\n[move] Rock"

Critical breakthrough analysis:\n   - My switch to Rock was successful - they played Paper\n   - This confirms they were trying to counter my Paper pattern\n   - They expected me to continue with Paper and played Paper to counter my expected Rock counter\n   - Breaking my pattern worked perfectly\n\n4. Current situation assessment:\n   - I just won +3 points, significantly improving my position\n   - I'm now only -2 points instead of -5\n   - The opponent just lost with Paper to my Rock\n\n5. Opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost with Paper to my Rock\n   - Based on their previous pattern, they often try to counter my winning moves\n   - They might switch to Scissors (to beat Rock if I repeat it)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from Rock and play something else\n\n6. Strategic considerations for Round 10:\n   - If they play Scissors (expecting me to repeat Rock), I should play Rock (+1 point)\n   - If they play Rock (copying my winning move), I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If they play Paper again, I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Pattern-breaking vs. exploitation:\n   - I successfully broke their prediction by switching to Rock\n   - Now I need to decide: exploit their likely counter to Rock, or continue being unpredictable\n   - They've shown they counter winning moves, so they might play Scissors\n\nGiven their pattern of countering my winning moves and that Rock just won big for me, they're likely to play Scissors to counter a potential Rock repeat. I'll play Rock again to beat their expected Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

Critical analysis of Round 10:\n   - I predicted they'd play Scissors to counter my Rock - I was RIGHT about their move\n   - BUT I made a fundamental error: Scissors BEATS Rock, not the other way around!\n   - I confused the rules: Rock beats Scissors, but Scissors beats Rock\n   - My prediction was correct, but my counter-move was wrong\n\n4. Rules clarification check:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1 points)\n   - Rock beats Paper (+3 points) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (+1 points)\n   - So if opponent plays Scissors, I should play Rock... wait, that's wrong\n   - Actually: Rock beats Scissors, so if they play Scissors, Rock should win\n   - Let me re-read: \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points\"\n   - So Scissors beats Rock! I had it backwards.\n\n5. Correct rule understanding:\n   - Paper beats Scissors\n   - Rock beats Paper  \n   - Scissors beats Rock\n   - It's like Rock-Paper-Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock\n   - Wait, that's the traditional game, but here it says \"scissors beats rock\"\n\n6. Re-reading the rules carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"  \n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So in THIS game: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper (cycle)\n\n7. Strategy for Round 11:\n   - They just won with Scissors\n   - Following their pattern, they might switch to counter my expected move\n   - If they expect me to play Paper (to beat Scissors), they might play Scissors again\n   - If they expect me to switch randomly, they might play Rock or Paper\n   - To beat Scissors, I need Paper\n\nGiven they just won with Scissors and might repeat it (or expect me to counter with Paper), I'll play Paper to beat their potential Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper"

Win-loss pattern analysis for opponent:\n   - When they win, they often switch moves next round\n   - Round 10: Won with Scissors \u2192 Round 11: Switched to Rock\n   - Round 7: Won with Rock \u2192 Round 8: Switched to Paper\n   - Round 2: Won with Rock \u2192 Round 3: Repeated Rock (exception)\n\n5.

Simplified decision matrix:\n   - Against Scissors: Play Rock (+1 if I'm right, but wait... Scissors beats Rock!)\n   - Against Paper: Play Scissors (+1)\n   - Against Rock: Play Paper (+3)\n\n8. Rule check again:\n   - Scissors beats Rock (opponent gets +1, I get -1)\n   - So to beat Scissors, I need Paper\n   - To beat Paper, I need Scissors  \n   - To beat Rock, I need Paper\n\nGiven they just won with Rock and tend to switch after winning, plus the fact that Scissors and Paper are both possible switches, I'll go with Scissors to beat Paper (which seems like a logical switch from Rock).\n\n[move] Scissors"

Recent rounds analysis:\n   - Round 15: I won with Scissors vs their Rock (+1)\n   - Round 16: I lost with Rock vs their Scissors (-1) - pattern broke\n   - Round 17: I lost with Paper vs their Rock (-3) - losing streak\n\n3. Opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 15: Rock\n   - Round 16: Scissors  \n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Pattern: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\n4. New pattern recognition:\n   - They're alternating between Rock and Scissors\n   - Round 15: Rock, Round 16: Scissors, Round 17: Rock\n   - If this continues: Round 18 should be Scissors\n\n5. Strategic thinking:\n   - If they play Scissors in Round 18, what beats Scissors?\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1 point)\n   - But I just lost badly with Paper, so I'm hesitant\n\n6. Alternative analysis:\n   - Maybe they're not alternating, maybe they just favor Rock and Scissors\n   - Rock appeared in Rounds 15 and 17\n   - Scissors appeared in Rounds 14 and 16\n   - They seem to avoid Paper lately\n\n7. Counter-strategy options:\n   - If Scissors: Play Paper (+1)\n   - If Rock: Play Paper (+3)\n   - If Paper: Play Scissors (+1)\n\n8. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper covers both Rock and Scissors well\n   - Even if they play Paper (unlikely based on recent behavior), I only get 0 points\n   - The alternating pattern suggests Scissors next, which Paper beats\n\nDespite my recent loss with Paper, the logic still supports it. If they're alternating Rock-Scissors and Scissors is next, Paper is the right choice.\n\n[move] Paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Current total after Round 18: -4 + 0 = -4 points\n   - Tie means no progress, but also no further losses\n\n2. Recent opponent moves analysis:\n   - Round 15: Rock\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Pattern: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\n3. Pattern reassessment:\n   - My alternating Rock-Scissors theory was wrong\n   - They're now using all three moves in recent rounds\n   - They may be trying to be more unpredictable after I exploited their counter-pattern\n\n4. New observations:\n   - Round 18 tie suggests we might be thinking similarly now\n   - They've used Rock twice, Scissors once, Paper once in last 4 rounds\n   - No clear pattern emerging\n\n5. Strategic considerations for Round 19:\n   - They just played Paper (tied with mine)\n   - After ties, their behavior is less predictable from my limited data\n   - They might switch away from Paper, repeat it, or play randomly\n\n6. Meta-game analysis:\n   - I successfully exploited their counter-pattern for 4 rounds\n   - They adapted and broke that pattern\n   - Now we're in a more random/unpredictable phase\n   - I need to think about what gives me the best expected value\n\n7. Expected value analysis:\n   - Rock: +3 vs Paper, -1 vs Scissors, 0 vs Rock\n   - Paper: +1 vs Scissors, -3 vs Rock, 0 vs Paper  \n   - Scissors: +1 vs Rock, -1 vs Paper, 0 vs Scissors\n\n8. Risk-reward consideration:\n   - If they're playing more randomly now, Rock has the highest upside (+3)\n   - But also the highest downside when wrong (-1 vs Scissors)\n   - Paper is more conservative but has severe downside vs Rock (-3)\n   - Scissors is most balanced: +1 best case, -1 worst case\n\nGiven the unpredictable phase we're in and wanting to balance risk/reward, I'll go with Scissors for its balanced payoff structure.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Updated game history:\n   - Current total after Round 19: -4 + 1 = -3 points\n   - Finally won again and making progress back toward even\n\n2. Recent opponent moves:\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock  \n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n3. Key observation:\n   - They played Rock in both Round 17 and Round 19\n   - Rock appears frequently in their recent play\n   - They seem to favor Rock when being unpredictable\n\n4. Strategic question for Round 20:\n   - Will they revert to their old counter-pattern behavior?\n   - I just won with Scissors in Round 19\n   - If they go back to countering, they should play Paper (which beats Scissors)\n   - If they continue random/Rock-heavy play, they might play Rock again\n\n5. Decision matrix:\n   - If they play Paper (counter-pattern): I should play Scissors... wait, Paper beats Scissors\n   - Actually, if they play Paper, I should play Rock (+3 points)\n   - If they play Rock (continuing Rock-heavy trend): I should play Paper (+3 points)  \n   - If they play Scissors: I should play Rock (+1 point)\n\n6. Pattern probability assessment:\n   - Counter-pattern (Paper): Moderate probability - they showed this before\n   - Rock-heavy (Rock): Moderate probability - they played Rock twice recently\n   - Random (Scissors): Lower probability - less frequent lately\n\n7. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Rock: Beats Paper (+3), beats Scissors (+1), loses to Rock (0)\n   - Paper: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Rock (-3), ties Paper (0)\n   - Both Rock and Paper could yield +3 points in different scenarios\n\n8. Strategic choice:\n   - Paper beats Rock for +3 points (their frequent recent choice)\n   - Rock beats Paper for +3 points (if they counter my Scissors)\n   - Given they played Rock twice in last 4 rounds, Paper seems like the better bet\n\nI'll play Paper to capitalize on their Rock-heavy tendency for the +3 bonus.\n\n[move] Paper"

Updated game history:\n   - Current total after Round 20: -3 + 1 = -2 points\n   - Two wins in a row, steadily climbing back\n\n2. Recent opponent moves (last 5 rounds):\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Rock\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Pattern: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\n3. Interesting pattern observation:\n   - Round 16: Scissors, Round 20: Scissors (4 rounds apart)\n   - Round 17: Rock, Round 19: Rock (2 rounds apart)\n   - They might be cycling: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - If this 5-move cycle continues, next should be Rock\n\n4. Alternative analysis:\n   - They played Scissors in Round 20 (just lost to my Paper)\n   - Are they back to counter-pattern behavior?\n   - I won with Paper, so counter-pattern would be Rock next round\n   - This aligns with the cycle theory (Rock should be next)\n\n5. Prediction for Round 21:\n   - Both cycle theory and counter-pattern suggest Rock\n   - High confidence they'll play Rock\n\n6. Counter-strategy:\n   - If they play Rock, I need Paper to beat it (+3 points)\n   - Paper vs Rock = +3 points (maximum reward)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper vs Rock: +3 points (excellent)\n   - Paper vs Scissors: +1 point (good)\n   - Paper vs Paper: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Paper is strong against 2/3 possibilities\n\n8. Confidence level:\n   - Multiple theories point to Rock\n   - Even if wrong, Paper performs reasonably well\n   - High confidence play\n\nBoth the potential 5-move cycle pattern and the counter-pattern behavior suggest they'll play Rock next. I'll counter with Paper for the +3 point maximum reward.\n\n[move] Paper"

Key observation:\n   - They played Scissors in both Round 20 and Round 21\n   - This breaks the cycle theory I had\n   - They repeated Scissors after losing with it in Round 20\n\n4. New pattern analysis:\n   - Round 20: Scissors (lost to my Paper)\n   - Round 21: Scissors (lost to my Paper again)\n   - They're repeating a losing move - this is either:\n     a) Stubbornness/trying to break my Paper streak\n     b) Setting up a psychological trap\n     c) Random play\n\n5. Strategic considerations for Round 22:\n   - They've lost with Scissors twice in a row to my Paper\n   - Will they:\n     a) Switch away from Scissors (logical)\n     b) Try Scissors again (stubborn/trap)\n     c) Play randomly\n\n6. If they switch from Scissors:\n   - Most likely switches: Rock or Paper\n   - If Rock: I should play Paper (+3 points)\n   - If Paper: I should play Scissors (+1 point)\n\n7.
