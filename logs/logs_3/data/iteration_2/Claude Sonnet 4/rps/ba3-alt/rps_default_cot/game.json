They played Scissors twice in a row (rounds 11-12). This could mean:\n1. They're sticking with Scissors since it worked in round 11\n2. They're trying to establish a new pattern\n3. They expect me to continue countering with Paper\n\nNow I need to predict their next move:\n- If they continue with Scissors: Rock beats it (+1 point)\n- If they switch back to Paper: Rock beats it (+3 points)\n- If they switch to Rock: Paper beats it (+3 points)\n\nGiven their history of Paper preference and the fact that Scissors has worked for them recently, I need to consider what's most likely. They might:\n- Stick with Scissors (two in a row suggests possible commitment)\n- Go back to Paper (their historical favorite)\n- Try Rock (to complete the cycle or adapt)\n\nSince Rock beats both Scissors (+1) and Paper (+3), and only loses to Paper (-3), Rock seems like the statistically best choice here. Their Paper bias throughout the game makes Rock particularly attractive.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their recent pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. They're cycling through all three moves now, which makes them much harder to predict.\n\nLooking at their behavior:\n- They've learned to use Scissors effectively to counter my Rock preference\n- They still return to Paper periodically (their fundamental favorite)\n- They use Rock as strategic breaks\n- They're now showing more sophisticated mixed strategies\n\nSince they just played Scissors and have shown they can cycle through moves, they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (if they think I'll play Rock again)\n2. Switch to Paper (completing a cycle or returning to favorite)\n3. Switch to Rock (mixing things up)\n\nGiven that I just lost to their Scissors with my Rock, they might expect me to switch away from Rock. If they think I'll play Paper (to beat Scissors), they might choose Scissors again. But if they think I'll adapt with Paper, they might play Scissors to beat it.\n\nWait - that's wrong. Paper beats Scissors, not the other way around. Let me reconsider:\n\nIf they expect me to play Paper (to counter Scissors), they should play Scissors... no, that loses to Paper. They should play Rock to beat Paper.\n\nI think Paper is a good choice here - it beats Scissors if they repeat, and only loses to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They're now cycling through all moves strategically\n\nTheir recent pattern suggests they might continue the cycle with Paper next, or they might expect me to adapt again. \n\nLooking at this strategically:\n- If they play Paper: Rock beats it (+3, getting back the points I just lost)\n- If they play Scissors: Rock beats it (+1)\n- If they play Rock: Tie (0 points)\n\nGiven that they just scored a big +3 with Rock, and considering their historical Paper preference, there's a good chance they might return to Paper. Rock seems like the right counter-play here.\n\nAlso, I notice they often follow big wins with their comfort zone moves, and Paper has been their historical favorite.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
