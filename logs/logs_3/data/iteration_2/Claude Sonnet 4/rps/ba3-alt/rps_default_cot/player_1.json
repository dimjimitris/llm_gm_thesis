    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it wins\n   - Rock also has the highest potential penalty (-3 points) when it loses\n   - Paper and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1 points)\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it seems strong/aggressive\n   - This makes paper a potentially strong counter-choice\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely): paper wins and gives me +3 points\n   - If opponent plays paper: scissors wins and gives me +1 point\n   - If opponent plays scissors: rock wins and gives me +3 points\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper has good odds against a fresh player who might choose rock\n   - Paper's worst case is losing -1 point to scissors\n   - This seems like a reasonable risk/reward trade-off\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, same as me\n   - Fresh players might stick with what they tried before\n   - Or they might think I'll stick with paper and try to counter it\n   - If they expect me to play paper again, they might choose scissors\n\n3.

Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+3 points) and loses to paper (-3 points)\n   - Since opponent might switch to scissors to counter my previous paper choice, rock could be very profitable\n   - Rock also has the highest potential reward when it wins\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent showed they can think strategically by choosing paper initially\n   - They might anticipate I'll stick with paper and counter with scissors\n   - Playing rock counters this potential counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: I'll switch to rock to potentially catch scissors and earn the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Risk assessment:\n   - Rock gives +3 if it wins but -3 if it loses\n   - I'm already behind, so I might need to take bigger risks\n   - If they expect me to play rock and counter with scissors, that would hurt\n   - But if they stick with their successful paper, rock wins big\n\nFinal decision: I'll take the risk and play rock, betting they'll either stick with paper or not expect this aggressive move while I'm behind.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Update the game history and score:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points each)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie, 0 points each)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I won +1 point\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won +1 point\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost -1 point\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Current score: Me +1 point, Opponent -1 point (Back in the lead by 2 points!)\n\n2. Analyze the successful prediction:\n   - I correctly bet that opponent would stick with their successful paper\n   - My aggressive rock play paid off with the maximum +3 points\n   - I've regained the lead and momentum\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\n   - They played paper twice in a row (rounds 8 and 9)\n   - They might be getting into a pattern or expecting me to counter\n\n4. Consider opponent's current mindset:\n   - They just lost big (-3 points) and are now behind again\n   - They might be frustrated that their previous counter-thinking failed\n   - They could either stick with paper or switch to counter my rock\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - If they expect me to play rock again (since it just won big): they might play scissors\n   - If they think I'll switch: they need to guess what I'll switch to\n   - They might go back to rock (their historically favored move) for a comeback attempt\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays scissors (to counter expected rock): paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm ahead and have momentum\n   - I don't need to take huge risks right now\n   - The opponent might expect me to repeat rock and counter with scissors\n   - Paper counters scissors and maintains steady progress\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent is likely to expect rock from me after my big win\n   - They'll probably counter with scissors\n   - Playing paper counters their scissors counter-strategy\n   - This is similar to my successful round 6 logic\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely scissors response to my successful rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recognize the successful pattern:\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won\n   - Both times I correctly predicted opponent would counter my previous big rock win with scissors\n   - I'm now on a 2-game winning streak again\n\n3. Analyze opponent's recent moves:\n   - Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors\n   - They seem to be repeating moves or getting predictable under pressure\n   - They're clearly trying to counter my moves but falling into patterns\n\n4. Consider opponent's current state:\n   - They're behind by 4 points and losing momentum\n   - They've lost 2 rounds in a row\n   - They might be getting desperate or frustrated\n   - They just played scissors twice in a row\n\n5. Predict opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors (third time) if they're in a pattern\n   - They might switch to rock for the high-value +3 comeback attempt\n   - They might try paper to counter if they expect me to play rock\n   - Given their desperation, rock seems likely for the big points\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock (desperate comeback): paper wins (+3 points) - huge!\n   - If opponent plays paper: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I have a comfortable 4-point lead\n   - Paper has been working well for me lately\n   - Paper beats both scissors and rock (opponent's most likely moves)\n   - Paper only loses to rock, but if opponent plays rock, I win +3\n\n8. Wait, I need to double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n   - So if opponent plays rock, I lose -3 with paper, not win +3\n\n9. Corrected analysis:\n   - If opponent plays rock: I lose -3 with paper\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I win +1 with paper\n   - If opponent plays paper: I win +3 with rock\n\n10. Strategic decision:\n    - Opponent might go for rock (their favorite) for a desperate comeback\n    - But they also might expect me to play paper again since it's worked\n    - If they play scissors again (pattern), paper wins\n    - The risk of rock beating my paper is concerning given my lead\n    - Maybe I should play scissors to counter potential rock\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter a potential desperate rock play from the opponent while still beating paper if they try that.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze my excellent prediction:\n   - I correctly anticipated opponent would go for rock as a desperate comeback move\n   - My scissors perfectly countered their rock\n   - I'm now on a 3-game winning streak and have a commanding lead\n\n3. Examine opponent's pattern under pressure:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They went back to rock (their historically most-played move) when desperate\n   - This confirms they favor rock when they need big points\n\n4. Consider opponent's current desperation level:\n   - They're now behind by 6 points - a significant deficit\n   - They've lost 3 rounds in a row\n   - They're likely feeling very pressured and might make more predictable moves\n   - They need multiple high-value wins to catch up\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Rock just failed them, but they still need +3 point plays to catch up\n   - They might try rock again (desperation)\n   - They might switch to paper if they expect me to play scissors again\n   - They could try scissors, but that only gives +1 even if it wins\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: rock wins (+3 points)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: paper wins (+1 point)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I have a very comfortable 6-point lead\n   - I can afford to take some risks or play safely\n   - The opponent is likely to either repeat rock or switch to paper\n   - Paper seems less likely since they need high-value wins\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent might expect me to repeat scissors since it just worked\n   - If they counter with paper, I should play rock for the big +3\n   - If they stick with rock (desperation), scissors works again\n   - Given their desperate need for points, they might actually try paper to counter my successful scissors\n   - Playing rock catches this and gives me another big win\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting the opponent will switch to paper to counter my successful scissors strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays rock (most likely): scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - With a 12-point lead, I can afford to play safely\n   - I don't need big risks - steady +1 wins maintain my dominance\n   - The opponent is most likely to go back to rock for desperation points\n   - Scissors is the safe counter to their most probable move\n\n8.

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I expected opponent to play paper to counter my successful scissors\n   - Instead they played scissors, which beat my rock\n   - This breaks their pattern of playing rock when desperate\n   - They're showing they can still adapt and surprise me\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - They've now used all three moves in the last 4 rounds\n   - They're clearly trying different strategies to find something that works\n   - The scissors choice was smart - it countered my expected rock\n\n4. Consider opponent's current situation:\n   - They finally won a round and stopped my 5-game winning streak\n   - They're still behind by 12 points but showed they can adapt\n   - They might gain confidence from this successful prediction\n   - They proved they're not completely predictable\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Scissors just worked for them against my rock\n   - They might stick with scissors if they think I'll play rock again\n   - They might expect me to counter with paper and switch to rock\n   - Or they might try paper to counter if they expect me to play scissors\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - I still have a commanding 12-point lead\n   - One loss doesn't change my dominant position\n   - I should continue reading their moves carefully\n   - The opponent showed they can still think strategically\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent just succeeded with scissors and might repeat it\n   - They could also expect me to counter with paper and play rock\n   - Paper beats scissors and gives me a safe +1 win\n   - Even if they switch to rock, I only lose -3 but still maintain a big lead\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent might stick with successful scissors) paper\n"

Analyze my successful prediction:\n   - I correctly anticipated opponent would try rock after the paper tie\n   - My scissors perfectly countered their rock attempt\n   - They went back to their familiar high-value rock play\n   - I'm back to reading their moves effectively\n\n3. Examine opponent's recent pattern:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n   - They're cycling through different moves but gravitating back to rock\n   - Rock remains their go-to move when they need points\n   - The paper tie might have made them think I'd switch, so they countered with rock\n\n4. Consider opponent's current situation:\n   - They're back to being 14 points behind after a brief recovery\n   - Rock just failed them again - this keeps happening\n   - They're probably frustrated that rock keeps losing to my scissors\n   - They need to try something different or keep falling behind\n\n5.

Update the game history and score:\n   - Round 1-22: Previous rounds\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won +3 points\n   - Current score: Me +8 points, Opponent -8 points (Lead back to 16 points!)\n\n2. Analyze my successful read:\n   - I correctly predicted opponent would counter my successful scissors with paper\n   - My rock perfectly crushed their paper for maximum points\n   - I'm back to reading their adaptations accurately\n   - My lead is now a very comfortable 16 points again\n\n3. Examine the recent exchange pattern:\n   - Opponent: Rock \u2192 Scissors tie \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n   - Me: Paper \u2192 Scissors tie \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They're clearly trying to counter my moves but I'm staying one step ahead\n\n4. Consider opponent's current frustration:\n   - They just lost another high-value exchange (-3 points)\n   - Every time they try to adapt, I counter their adaptation\n   - They're back to a significant 16-point deficit\n   - They might be getting desperate or frustrated again\n\n5. Predict opponent's next move:\n   - Paper just failed them badly\n   - They might go back to rock (their most successful and favored move)\n   - They could try scissors as the only move they haven't used recently\n   - Or they might try paper again if they think I'll switch from rock\n\n6. Evaluate my counter-strategies:\n   - If opponent goes back to rock: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent tries scissors: paper wins (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays paper again: rock wins (+3 points)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - My 16-point lead is very strong again\n   - The opponent is likely to make a predictable move under pressure\n   - Rock has been their comfort zone throughout the game\n   - Any win essentially seals my victory\n\n8. Strategic decision:\n   - Opponent is probably frustrated and might return to their reliable rock\n   - Rock has been their most-played move and gives them +3 when it works\n   - After losing with paper, they might go back to what they know\n   - Scissors has consistently beaten their rock attempts\n\n[move] (Expecting frustrated return to reliable rock) scissors\n"
