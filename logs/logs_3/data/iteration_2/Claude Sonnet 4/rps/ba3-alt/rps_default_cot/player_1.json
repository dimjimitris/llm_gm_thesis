    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

I need to completely reassess what's happening here.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Face the catastrophic reality:**\n   - Previous total: -9 points\n   - Just lost: -3 points (maximum penalty)\n   - Current total: -12 points\n   - This is by far my worst position and I'm in complete free fall\n\n2. **Analyze what just happened:**\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - Rock beats paper for -3 points to me\n   - The opponent returned to rock right after our rock-rock tie\n   - This suggests rock truly is their dominant/default strategy\n\n3. **Review the brutal pattern:**\n   - When I try to be unpredictable (paper), they play their statistical favorite (rock)\n   - When I play statistically (scissors vs rock), they counter with paper\n   - When I try to counter-predict (rock), they either tie or I miss\n   - Every strategy I've tried has failed\n\n4. **Recognize the core issue:**\n   - Opponent's actual sequence shows rock appearing 11 out of 19 times (58%)\n   - But whenever I play scissors to counter rock, they seem to play paper\n   - When I switch strategies, they go back to rock\n   - They're either incredibly lucky or reading my patterns perfectly\n\n5. **Consider a reset approach:**\n   - I'm at -12 points, so I need multiple big wins to recover\n   - Maybe I should go back to basics: they play rock most often statistically\n   - Stop overthinking and just play the mathematical favorite consistently\n\n6. **Make a decision:**\n   - Their statistical preference is still rock (11/19 times)\n   - Scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - I need to start somewhere, and small consistent wins might be better than big losses\n\n[move] Scissors - Going back to the mathematical basics: they play rock most frequently, so scissors is the statistically correct counter, accepting that I need to start building back up from -12 points one small win at a time.\n"

Let me analyze this carefully and try to build momentum.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Update my score:**\n   - Previous total: -12 points\n   - Just won: +1 point\n   - Current total: -11 points\n   - Still in a deep hole, but at least moving in the right direction\n\n2. **Analyze what just worked:**\n   - I played scissors, opponent played rock\n   - This confirms scissors beats rock for +1 point\n   - When I go back to statistical basics, it can work\n\n3. **Review opponent's pattern:**\n   - They now have played rock 12 out of 20 total rounds (60%)\n   - Recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - Despite their adaptive counter-plays, rock remains their most frequent choice\n\n4. **Consider opponent's likely reaction:**\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors\n   - Based on past pattern, they might:\n     - Switch to paper to counter my scissors (they've done this before)\n     - Stick with rock (their clear statistical preference)\n     - Their adaptation pattern suggests paper might be coming\n\n5. **Evaluate my strategic options:**\n   - If opponent plays paper (countering my scissors): I need rock (+3 points!)\n   - If opponent plays rock again: I need scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I need paper (+1 point)\n   - Given their pattern of switching to paper after losing with rock, rock might be optimal\n\n6. **Make the strategic choice:**\n   - The opponent has shown they switch to paper when scissors beats their rock\n   - This happened multiple times before\n   - Rock gives me the maximum +3 point recovery if they follow their pattern\n   - I need big wins to climb out of -11 points\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating the opponent will switch to paper (as they've done before when losing rock vs scissors), aiming for the maximum +3 point recovery to continue climbing back from my deep deficit.\n"

I've climbed 4 points in 2 rounds\n\n2. **Analyze what just worked perfectly:**\n   - I predicted the opponent would switch to paper after losing rock vs scissors\n   - They did exactly that: played paper\n   - My rock beat their paper for +3 points\n   - This confirms I'm starting to read their adaptation pattern correctly\n\n3. **Review the opponent's reactive pattern:**\n   - Pattern: rock (lost to scissors) \u2192 paper (lost to rock)\n   - They're showing a clear reactive strategy:\n     - Default to rock most of the time\n     - When rock loses to scissors, switch to paper\n     - When paper loses to rock, likely return to rock\n\n4. **Consider their likely next move:**\n   - They just lost with paper to my rock\n   - Based on their pattern, they might:\n     - Return to rock (their statistical favorite and \"safe\" choice)\n     - Try scissors (completing the cycle)\n     - Continue with paper (less likely after it just failed)\n\n5. **Evaluate strategic options:**\n   - If opponent returns to rock: I need scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I need paper (+1 point)  \n   - If opponent continues paper: I need rock (+3 points)\n   - Given their tendency to return to rock after failed deviations, scissors seems optimal\n\n6. **Make the strategic decision:**\n   - The opponent typically returns to rock after their alternative strategies fail\n   - They just lost with paper, so rock is their likely comfort zone choice\n   - Scissors gives me another win to continue the momentum\n   - I need to keep building on this success\n\n[move] Scissors - Expecting the opponent to return to their rock comfort zone after the failed paper attempt, aiming to continue my recovery momentum with another +1 point win.\n"

I've won 3 straight and climbed from -12 to -7 points\n\n2. **Analyze my successful pattern recognition:**\n   - I correctly predicted: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Opponent's reactive cycle: rock (loses to scissors) \u2192 paper (loses to rock) \u2192 rock (loses to scissors)\n   - They're following a predictable adaptation pattern that I can exploit\n\n3. **Confirm the opponent's behavioral pattern:**\n   - They have clear tendencies:\n     - Rock is their default/comfort choice\n     - When rock fails, they try paper to counter scissors\n     - When paper fails, they return to rock\n     - This creates a exploitable cycle\n\n4. **Predict their likely next move:**\n   - They just lost with rock to my scissors (again)\n   - Based on established pattern, they should switch to paper to counter my scissors\n   - This is exactly what happened before: rock (lost) \u2192 paper\n\n5. **Plan my optimal counter:**\n   - If opponent plays paper (expected): I need rock (+3 points!)\n   - If opponent plays rock (breaking pattern): I need scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I need paper (+1 point)\n   - Paper is most likely based on their reactive pattern\n\n6. **Make the strategic choice:**\n   - The pattern strongly suggests they'll play paper to counter my successful scissors\n   - Rock gives me another maximum +3 point win\n   - This could bring me to -4 points, getting close to breaking even\n   - I should capitalize on this pattern while it's working\n\n[move] Rock - Following the established pattern where opponent switches to paper after losing rock vs scissors, aiming for another maximum +3 point win to continue my strong recovery.\n"
