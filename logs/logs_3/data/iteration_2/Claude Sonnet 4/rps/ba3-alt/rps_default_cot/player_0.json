    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with an intuitive first choice. Many people intuitively choose Rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nIf they choose Rock, I should choose Paper to win 3 points.\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to win 1 point.\nIf they choose Scissors, I should choose Rock to win 3 points.\n\nGiven that Rock is a common first choice and Paper beats Rock for the maximum 3-point reward, I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won 3 points - they played Paper and my Rock beat it for the maximum reward.\n\nLet me analyze the complete pattern:\nRound 1: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\nRound 2: Both Rock (tie, 0 points)\nRound 3: I Rock, they Paper (I won +3 points)\nRound 4: I Rock, they Scissors (I lost -1 point)\nRound 5: I Paper, they Rock (I lost -3 points)\nRound 6: I Scissors, they Paper (I lost -1 point)\nRound 7: I Rock, they Paper (I won +3 points)\nRound 8: I Paper, they Scissors (I won +1 point)\nRound 9: I Paper, they Rock (I lost -3 points)\nRound 10: I Scissors, they Paper (I lost -1 point)\nRound 11: I Rock, they Scissors (I lost -1 point)\nRound 12: I Paper, they Rock (I lost -3 points)\nRound 13: I Rock, they Scissors (I lost -1 point)\nRound 14: I Scissors, they Rock (I won +1 point)\nRound 15: Both Paper (tie, 0 points)\nRound 16: I Rock, they Scissors (I lost -1 point)\nRound 17: I Paper, they Rock (I lost -3 points)\nRound 18: Both Scissors (tie, 0 points)\nRound 19: I Rock, they Paper (I won +3 points)\n\nTheir sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\nCurrent total score: -10 + 3 = -7 points\n\nGreat! This is my first win in several rounds. Looking at the pattern:\n- Rounds 3, 7, and 19: I played Rock, they played Paper, I won +3 each time\n- This suggests that when they play Paper, Rock is often a good counter\n\nTheir recent moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\nThey seem to have cycled through all three moves in the last three rounds.\n\nTheir move frequencies:\n- Paper: 7 times\n- Rock: 6 times\n- Scissors: 6 times\n\nPaper is still their most frequent choice, and they just played it. They might:\n1. Stick with Paper (their preferred move)\n2. Switch to avoid predictability\n3. Expect me to play Scissors (to counter Paper) and counter with Rock\n\nThe key insight is that when I've won with Rock against their Paper (3 times now), it's often been when the choice felt somewhat natural or logical, not forced.\n\nThey just played Paper. If they expect me to counter with Scissors, they might play Rock. But they also might stick with Paper or switch to Scissors.\n\nGiven that Rock vs Paper has been my most successful combination (+3 points each time), and I just won with it, they might not expect me to repeat Rock immediately.\n\nI'll try Scissors - it beats Rock if they try to counter my expected counter-move, and it only loses 1 point to Paper if they stick with it.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

We've now tied with Scissors twice in a row (rounds 18 and 20). This is the fourth tie overall.\n\nTheir recent moves: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nLooking at their move frequencies:\n- Paper: 7 times\n- Scissors: 7 times\n- Rock: 6 times\n\nThey're almost perfectly balanced now, with Paper and Scissors tied for most frequent.\n\nThe fact that we both chose Scissors again suggests we might be thinking similarly about the game state. They just played Scissors after playing Paper, which could mean:\n1. They're trying to be unpredictable\n2. They anticipated I might play Scissors and chose to tie rather than lose\n3. They're following some pattern I'm not seeing\n\nKey observation: My wins have come from:\n- Rock vs Paper: 3 times (+3 each)\n- Paper vs Scissors: 1 time (+1)\n- Scissors vs Rock: 1 time (+1)\n\nThe Rock vs Paper combination has been by far my most successful (+9 total points from those wins alone).\n\nThey just played Scissors. The logical counter would be Rock, which has been my most successful move overall. But they've shown they can anticipate logical moves.\n\nHowever, given that Rock vs Paper has worked so well for me, and they might switch to Paper (their joint-most frequent move), I'll try Rock again.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

This appears to be a genuine pattern or weakness in their play.\n\nTheir recent moves: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\nMy recent moves: Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nTheir move frequencies:\n- Paper: 8 times\n- Scissors: 7 times\n- Rock: 6 times\n\nPaper is now clearly their most frequent choice. The fact that they keep playing Paper when I play Rock suggests either:\n1. They haven't fully recognized this pattern yet\n2. They're trying to break a different pattern and accidentally falling into this one\n3. There's something about the game state that makes them choose Paper\n\nThey just played Paper again. Given the incredible success of Rock vs Paper (4 wins for +12 points), I'm tempted to try Rock again. But they might finally catch on to this pattern.\n\nHowever, they might expect me to switch away from Rock now that it's worked twice in a row recently. If they think I'll play Scissors or Paper, they might play Rock or Scissors respectively.\n\nI think I'll stick with what's working. Rock has been my most successful move against their Paper choices.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They finally adapted to my Rock strategy. After I won 4 times with Rock vs their Paper, they switched to Scissors to counter my Rock.

If they continue the alternating pattern (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors), they might play Paper next. If so, Rock would win me +3 points again.\n\nBut they also might have learned from the Rock vs Paper pattern and expect me to play Rock, so they could stick with Scissors or play Rock themselves.\n\nThe key insight is that they do adapt to patterns, but sometimes with a delay of 1-2 rounds. Since they just countered my Rock with Scissors, they might expect me to switch away from Rock.\n\nI'll try Paper - it beats Rock if they switch to counter my expected Rock, and loses only 1 point to Scissors if they stick with it.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
