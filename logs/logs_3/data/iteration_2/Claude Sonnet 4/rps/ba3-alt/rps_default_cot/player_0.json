    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper and Scissors have lower but more balanced payoffs.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), they might not have a developed strategy yet.

They might:\n- Stick with Scissors (two in a row suggests possible commitment)\n- Go back to Paper (their historical favorite)\n- Try Rock (to complete the cycle or adapt)\n\nSince Rock beats both Scissors (+1) and Paper (+3), and only loses to Paper (-3), Rock seems like the statistically best choice here.

Their recent pattern: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors. They're cycling through all three moves now, which makes them much harder to predict.\n\nLooking at their behavior:\n- They've learned to use Scissors effectively to counter my Rock preference\n- They still return to Paper periodically (their fundamental favorite)\n- They use Rock as strategic breaks\n- They're now showing more sophisticated mixed strategies\n\nSince they just played Scissors and have shown they can cycle through moves, they might:\n1. Continue with Scissors (if they think I'll play Rock again)\n2. Switch to Paper (completing a cycle or returning to favorite)\n3. Switch to Rock (mixing things up)\n\nGiven that I just lost to their Scissors with my Rock, they might expect me to switch away from Rock. If they think I'll play Paper (to beat Scissors), they might choose Scissors again. But if they think I'll adapt with Paper, they might play Scissors to beat it.\n\nWait - that's wrong. Paper beats Scissors, not the other way around. Let me reconsider:\n\nIf they expect me to play Paper (to counter Scissors), they should play Scissors... no, that loses to Paper. They should play Rock to beat Paper.\n\nI think Paper is a good choice here - it beats Scissors if they repeat, and only loses to Rock.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their recent sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock - they just completed a perfect cycle and correctly predicted my adaptation each time.\n\nThey're showing sophisticated counter-prediction:\n1. When I played Rock after winning with it, they played Scissors\n2. When I switched to Paper (to counter Scissors), they played Rock\n3. They're now cycling through all moves strategically\n\nTheir recent pattern suggests they might continue the cycle with Paper next, or they might expect me to adapt again. \n\nLooking at this strategically:\n- If they play Paper: Rock beats it (+3, getting back the points I just lost)\n- If they play Scissors: Rock beats it (+1)\n- If they play Rock: Tie (0 points)\n\nGiven that they just scored a big +3 with Rock, and considering their historical Paper preference, there's a good chance they might return to Paper. Rock seems like the right counter-play here.\n\nAlso, I notice they often follow big wins with their comfort zone moves, and Paper has been their historical favorite.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

They're not following simple patterns anymore but are instead reading my tendencies and countering them.\n\nSince they just played Scissors and have been very successful with their counter-predictions, I need to think differently. They might expect me to:\n1. Play Paper (to beat Scissors)\n2. Continue with Rock (stubbornly)\n3. Try Scissors (to mix things up)\n\nGiven their recent success with counter-prediction, maybe I should go with the straightforward counter: Paper beats Scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
