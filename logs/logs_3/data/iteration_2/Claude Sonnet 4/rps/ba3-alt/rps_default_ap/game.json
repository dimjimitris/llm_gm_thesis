This makes rock potentially very valuable if I can predict when my opponent might play paper.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about this payoff asymmetry yet. New players often start with rock as it's psychologically appealing (seems strong), or they might go with a random choice.\n\nGiven that rock has the highest potential reward (+3) and if my opponent plays paper (which new players sometimes avoid thinking it's \"weak\"), I could get a big advantage. Even if they play scissors and beat my rock, I only lose 1 point.\n\n[move] Rock - Taking advantage of the asymmetric payoff structure where rock gives +3 points when winning against paper, while only risking -1 point loss against scissors.\n"

My opponent just lost badly (-3 points) with paper. They now know that rock beats paper with a harsh penalty. A rational player might:\n\n1. Avoid paper since it just cost them heavily\n2. Consider scissors to counter my rock (since I just played rock successfully)\n3. Or they might think I'll switch away from rock after winning with it\n\nHowever, there's a psychological factor - many players will want to \"get revenge\" for that big loss. They might specifically choose scissors to beat the rock that just crushed them.\n\nBut I also need to consider that rock's asymmetric payoff structure is still advantageous. Even if they play scissors (giving them +1 and me -1), the risk-reward is still reasonable given rock's potential +3 upside.\n\nThat said, if they're likely to play scissors now, I should consider paper to beat their scissors and get +1 point.\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating opponent will try scissors to counter my previous winning rock move, so I'll counter their likely counter-strategy.\n"

Perhaps trying to establish a pattern\n\nHowever, the fact that we just tied with both playing scissors might cause them to switch.
