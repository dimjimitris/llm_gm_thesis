    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 points when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have established patterns\n   - They might choose randomly or go with common first moves\n   - Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing rock: High reward (+3) if opponent plays paper, but lose (-1) if opponent plays scissors\n   - Playing paper: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays scissors, but big loss (-3) if opponent plays rock\n   - Playing scissors: Moderate reward (+1) if opponent plays rock, but lose (-1) if opponent plays paper\n\n5. Make strategic decision:\n   - Since rock offers the highest potential gain (+3 points) and the opponent is fresh/unpredictable\n   - The high reward potential of rock outweighs the moderate risk\n   - Against a random player, rock gives the best risk-reward ratio\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to maximize potential points.\n\n[move] rock"

Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3)\n   - Current score: -2 points total\n\n2. Identify opponent's current pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors(5x) \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now played rock 3 times in a row!\n   - This is becoming a strong new pattern after breaking from scissors\n\n3. Recognize my strategic errors:\n   - I've been overthinking and second-guessing myself\n   - In rounds 7 and 9, I played paper against their rock and lost -3 each time\n   - I need to directly counter their current rock pattern instead of trying to predict switches\n\n4. Analyze opponent's strategy:\n   - They successfully broke from scissors to rock\n   - Rock has been very effective for them (winning twice, tying once)\n   - They might continue with rock since it's working well\n   - Or they might finally switch, knowing I should counter rock with scissors\n\n5. Consider the rules and my options:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 to rock, -3 to paper)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 to scissors, -1 to rock)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 to paper, -1 to scissors)\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - They've played rock 3 times in a row - this is a clear pattern\n   - I need to stop overthinking and directly counter with scissors\n   - Even if they switch, scissors only risks -1 (against paper) vs the -3 I keep taking with paper\n   - I need to recover from my -2 deficit and scissors is the logical counter to their rock pattern\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their established rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify opponent's latest pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors(5x) \u2192 Rock(4x)\n   - They've now played rock 4 consecutive times!\n   - This is an even stronger rock pattern than their previous scissors pattern\n\n3. Analyze my successful counter-strategy:\n   - Round 10: I finally played scissors against their rock and won +1\n   - This was the correct counter-move that I should have made earlier\n   - I'm back on track with the right strategy\n\n4. Consider opponent's next move:\n   - They've played rock 4 times in a row\n   - This is now a very established pattern\n   - They might continue with rock (pattern persistence)\n   - Or they might break the pattern, expecting me to play scissors again\n\n5. Evaluate the risk-reward:\n   - If they play rock again (likely): Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to paper: Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1), Paper ties (0)\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The rock pattern is extremely strong (4 in a row)\n   - My scissors counter just worked perfectly\n   - Even if they break the pattern, scissors only risks -1 against paper\n   - This is much safer than the -3 risk I was taking with paper\n   - I should continue exploiting their rock pattern until they prove they've broken it\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with scissors to exploit their strong rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify opponent's remarkable pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors(5x) \u2192 Rock(5x)\n   - They've now played rock 5 consecutive times!\n   - This is an incredibly strong and consistent pattern\n\n3. Analyze my successful counter-strategy momentum:\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - I'm now on a 2-game winning streak with scissors\n   - I've recovered from -1 back to 0 points\n\n4. Consider the pattern strength:\n   - 5 rocks in a row is an extremely strong behavioral pattern\n   - This matches the strength of their previous 5 scissors in a row\n   - The opponent seems to get locked into patterns for extended periods\n   - Breaking a 5-round pattern is psychologically difficult\n\n5. Evaluate the probability and risk:\n   - If they play rock again (very high probability): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they break pattern to scissors: Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they break pattern to paper: Scissors loses (-1)\n   - The risk-reward strongly favors continuing with scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - The pattern is at maximum strength (5 in a row)\n   - My counter-strategy is working perfectly\n   - Even if they break the pattern, the worst outcome is -1\n   - I should continue exploiting this pattern until they prove they've changed\n   - The momentum is clearly in my favor\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with scissors to exploit their extremely strong rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify opponent's extraordinary pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors(5x) \u2192 Rock(6x)\n   - They've now played rock 6 consecutive times!\n   - This is an absolutely remarkable and predictable pattern\n\n3. Analyze my dominant counter-strategy:\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 12: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - I'm now on a 3-game winning streak with scissors\n   - I've recovered from negative territory back to +1\n\n4. Consider the psychological momentum:\n   - 6 rocks in a row is an incredibly strong behavioral lock-in\n   - This opponent clearly gets stuck in very long patterns\n   - They showed this same behavior with 5 scissors earlier\n   - Breaking such an entrenched pattern becomes increasingly difficult\n\n5. Evaluate the statistical likelihood:\n   - The probability of them playing rock again is extremely high\n   - Even if they're planning to break the pattern, the odds heavily favor rock\n   - My scissors counter has been 100% successful for 3 straight rounds\n   - The risk-reward calculation is overwhelmingly in favor of scissors\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - This is one of the strongest patterns I've ever seen (6 in a row)\n   - My counter-strategy is working flawlessly\n   - I'm building positive momentum and should ride this wave\n   - The opponent has shown they commit to patterns for very long periods\n   - I should continue exploiting this until they definitively break it\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with scissors to exploit their extraordinary 6-round rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Identify opponent's absolutely extraordinary pattern:\n   - Paper \u2192 Scissors(5x) \u2192 Rock(7x)\n   - They've now played rock 7 consecutive times!\n   - This is beyond remarkable - it's an unprecedented behavioral lock\n\n3. Analyze my perfect counter-strategy streak:\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 12: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - Round 13: Scissors vs Rock \u2192 I won +1\n   - I'm now on a 4-game winning streak with scissors\n   - I've turned the game around from negative to +2\n\n4. Consider the pattern strength and psychology:\n   - 7 rocks in a row is statistically almost impossible by chance\n   - This opponent is completely locked into this pattern\n   - They previously showed 5 scissors in a row, now 7 rocks\n   - This suggests they have very strong pattern-sticking behavior\n   - Breaking from such an entrenched pattern would be extremely difficult\n\n5. Evaluate risk vs. reward:\n   - If they play rock again (virtually certain): Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they somehow break to scissors: Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they break to paper: Scissors loses (-1)\n   - The probability massively favors continuing with scissors\n   - Even worst case is only -1, while expected outcome is +1\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - This is the strongest pattern I could ever hope to exploit\n   - My counter-strategy has been absolutely perfect for 4 rounds\n   - The opponent shows no signs of breaking their rock obsession\n   - I'm building excellent momentum and should not change course\n   - This is a textbook example of exploiting predictable behavior\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Continue with scissors to exploit their incredible 7-round rock pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"
