Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new), they might not have developed a sophisticated strategy yet. New players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it's psychologically associated with strength)\n   - Make random choices\n   - Or choose paper as it's the first option mentioned\n\n4. Given that rock gives the highest payoff when it wins, and new players might choose rock or make somewhat predictable choices, I should consider what beats the most likely moves:\n   - If they choose rock (common for new players), I should choose paper to get +1\n   - If they choose paper, I should choose scissors to get +1\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock to get +3\n\n5. Since rock gives me the maximum reward (+3) when it wins, and scissors might be less commonly chosen by new players, rock seems like a strong opening move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially gain the maximum 3 points if my opponent chooses paper.\n\n[move] rock"

This tells me something important about my opponent - they also chose rock. This could mean:\n   - They had similar reasoning to mine (rock gives highest payoff)\n   - They're following a common beginner tendency to choose rock\n   - It could be coincidental\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with rock if they think it's a strong choice\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to play rock again\n   - If they're strategic, they might realize that since we both played rock, one of us might switch\n\n4. If they stick with rock again, I should play paper to win +1 point.\n   If they switch to paper (thinking I might play rock again), I should play scissors to win +1 point.\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play rock to win +3 points.\n\n5. Given that my opponent chose rock in round 1 (same as me), there's a reasonable chance they might stick with it or that they're inclined toward rock. Playing paper would counter this tendency and give me a win.\n\n6. Paper seems like a good strategic choice because:\n   - It beats rock (which they just played)\n   - It only loses to scissors, which might be less likely given their rock preference\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the possibility that my opponent will play rock again.\n\n[move] paper"

Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me recalculate the scoring:\n   - Round 2: I won with paper vs scissors = +1 point\n   - Round 3: I won with scissors vs rock = +1 point  \n   - Round 5: I won with paper vs scissors = +1 point\n   - Round 6: I lost with paper vs rock = -3 points\n   - Round 8: I lost with paper vs rock = -3 points\n   - Total: +1 +1 +1 -3 -3 = -3 points\n\n3.

Critical insight: My opponent is playing rock at an extremely high rate (6 out of 8 rounds = 75%) and has NEVER played paper. This is becoming a very clear pattern.\n\n5. However, I need to be careful - I've been punished heavily (-3 points each time) when I've tried to counter their rock with paper in recent rounds. This suggests either:\n   - They're exploiting my predictable counter-strategy\n   - They're doubling down on rock because it's working\n   - They might finally switch since rock has been so successful\n\n6. Looking at their recent sequence: rock-rock-rock (rounds 6-7-8). They're on a rock streak!\n\n7. Strategy options for round 9:\n   - If they continue with rock: I should play paper (+1 point) but I've been burned twice\n   - If they finally switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they finally play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n8. Given that they've never played paper in 8 rounds and have been heavily favoring rock, the most likely alternatives are rock (continuing the streak) or scissors (their only other move).\n\n9. Since I've lost 6 points from rock beating my paper in the last few rounds, maybe I should try a different approach. If they switch to scissors (which they do occasionally), playing rock would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially get +3 points if they switch to scissors, and to avoid another -3 penalty from their likely rock play.\n\n[move] rock"

Round results so far:\n   - Total score through round 8: -3 points\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Current total score: -3 points\n\n2. My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors  \n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Rock\n   \n   Rock: 7 times, Scissors: 2 times, Paper: 0 times (NEVER used in 9 rounds!)\n\n3. This is now an extreme pattern - my opponent is playing rock 78% of the time (7 out of 9 rounds) and has completely avoided paper for the entire game.\n\n4. Recent trend analysis:\n   - They're currently on a massive rock streak: rounds 6-7-8-9 (4 rocks in a row!)\n   - The only time they deviate from rock is to play scissors (rounds 2 and 5)\n   - They have NEVER played paper - this is statistically very unusual\n\n5. Key insight: My opponent seems to have a strategy of heavily favoring rock, possibly because:\n   - Rock gives the maximum reward (+3) when it wins\n   - They might be exploiting the fact that I've been trying to counter with paper\n   - They may have developed a rock-heavy strategy\n\n6. For round 10, I need to consider:\n   - Will they continue their rock streak (making it 5 in a row)?\n   - Will they finally break the streak with scissors?\n   - Will they ever use paper? (Seems very unlikely at this point)\n\n7. Strategy analysis:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper (+1 point) - but this has cost me lately\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points) - maximum reward!\n   - If they finally play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point) - but they've never done this\n\n8. Given their 4-round rock streak, they might be due for a change. When they do change, it's always been to scissors. If I play rock and they switch to scissors, I get the maximum +3 points.\n\n9. However, if they continue with rock (which is statistically most likely), playing rock results in a tie (0 points) rather than a loss (-3 points from paper vs rock).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again. If they continue their rock preference, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors (their only alternative), I win big with +3 points.\n\n[move] rock"

This is now an overwhelming pattern:\n   - Rock: 80% of the time (8 out of 10 rounds)\n   - Currently on a 5-round rock streak (rounds 6-10)\n   - Has NEVER played paper in 10 rounds\n   - Only played scissors twice, both times breaking up rock sequences\n\n4. Critical analysis of their behavior:\n   - They seem to have settled into a rock-dominant strategy\n   - The 5-round rock streak is their longest yet\n   - When they do switch, it's always been to scissors (never paper)\n   - They might be exploiting the fact that rock gives maximum reward when it wins\n\n5. At this point, I need to make a strategic decision:\n   - Continue playing rock for ties (safe, 0 points each time)\n   - Risk playing paper to beat rock (+1 if they play rock, -3 if they switch to scissors)\n   - Play scissors hoping they finally use paper (+1 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock)\n\n6. Given their extreme rock preference and 5-round streak, there are two likely scenarios:\n   - They continue with rock (most statistically likely)\n   - They break the streak with scissors (their only alternative move)\n\n7. Risk analysis:\n   - If I play rock: Tie vs rock (0 points), lose vs scissors (-1 point)\n   - If I play paper: Win vs rock (+1 point), lose vs scissors (-3 points)\n   - If I play scissors: Lose vs rock (-1 point), win vs paper (+1 point - but they never play paper)\n\n8. Since they're on such a long rock streak, they might be due for a change. Historically, when they change, it's to scissors. But the streak is so long that continuing with rock is also very possible.\n\n9. I need to break out of the tie pattern. Given their 80% rock rate, playing paper has the best expected value, even with the risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their likely rock play and try to score a point, accepting the risk of a big loss if they switch to scissors.\n\n[move] paper"

Important observations:\n   - They finally broke their 5-round rock streak by playing scissors\n   - This follows their historical pattern: when they switch from rock, it's always to scissors\n   - They have now played scissors 3 times, always as a break from rock sequences\n   - They STILL have never played paper in 11 rounds\n\n4. Pattern analysis of their switches:\n   - Round 1 (rock) \u2192 Round 2 (scissors)\n   - Round 4 (rock) \u2192 Round 5 (scissors) \n   - Round 10 (rock) \u2192 Round 11 (scissors)\n   \n   Every time they play scissors, it's immediately after playing rock!\n\n5.

Strategy options:\n   - If they play rock (following their scissors\u2192rock pattern): I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+3 points)\n   - If they finally play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n9. Given their 100% consistency of returning to rock after playing scissors, and their complete avoidance of paper, rock seems extremely likely for round 12.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat the rock that they're very likely to play based on their consistent scissors\u2192rock pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

Wait - I need to reconsider what happened in round 12. The hint says I lost and scored -3 points, but according to the rules:\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for rock player, -3 for paper player\n   \n   So my opponent played rock, I played paper, they won +3, I lost -3. This confirms my pattern analysis was correct!\n\n4. Updated insights:\n   - My pattern prediction was RIGHT - they did return to rock after scissors (maintaining their scissors\u2192rock pattern)\n   - Rock frequency is now 75% (9 out of 12 rounds)\n   - They have NEVER played paper in 12 rounds\n   - Their scissors\u2192rock pattern remains 100% consistent\n\n5. Current situation analysis:\n   - They just played rock (round 12)\n   - Historically, after rock they either continue with rock OR switch to scissors\n   - They've never gone rock\u2192paper\n\n6. Looking at their post-rock behavior patterns:\n   - Sometimes they continue rock streaks (like rounds 6-10)\n   - Sometimes they switch to scissors after 1-2 rocks\n   - They're currently starting fresh after breaking their last streak\n\n7. Strategy consideration:\n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper (+1 point) - but this just cost me -3\n   - If they switch to scissors: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward!)\n   - If they finally play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point) - but they've never done this\n\n8. Given that they just completed a scissors\u2192rock cycle and have shown they can play long rock streaks OR switch to scissors relatively quickly, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\n9. Since I just lost 3 points trying to counter rock with paper, maybe I should try a different approach. If they switch to scissors (which they do periodically), playing rock gives me the maximum +3 points and would help recover from my losses.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially gain +3 points if they switch to scissors, and to avoid another -3 penalty if they continue with rock (tie instead).\n\n[move] rock"

Analysis of their recent behavior:\n   - Round 11: Scissors (broke their 5-round rock streak)\n   - Round 12: Rock (returned to rock after scissors, as always)\n   - Round 13: Rock (continuing with rock)\n\n5.

Strategic analysis at -8 points:\n   - I desperately need positive scores to recover\n   - If they switch to scissors (following their pattern): Rock wins +3 points\n   - If they continue rock: Rock ties for 0 points\n   - Playing paper risks another -3 loss if they switch to scissors\n\n7. The key insight: They've never had a rock streak longer than 5 rounds. They're currently at exactly 5 rounds. This might be their breaking point.\n\n8. Risk/reward for round 17:\n   - Rock vs scissors (if they switch) = +3 points - huge for my recovery\n   - Rock vs rock (if they continue) = 0 points - neutral\n   - This gives me the best expected value given their pattern\n\n9. Given their historical behavior of breaking 5-round streaks and my desperate need for points, rock offers the best chance for a significant positive score.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, betting that they'll break their 5-round streak with scissors, which would give me +3 points and help recover from my -8 deficit.\n\n[move] rock"

Round results so far:\n   - Previous total score: -8 points\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Current total score: -9 points\n\n2. Wait, I need to check this scoring. According to the rules:\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors player, -1 for rock player\n   \n   So my opponent played scissors, I played rock, they won +1, I lost -1. This is correct.\n\n3. My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors  \n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Rock\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Rock\n   - Round 9: Rock\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Rock\n   - Round 13: Rock\n   - Round 14: Rock\n   - Round 15: Rock\n   - Round 16: Rock\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   \n   Rock: 13 times, Scissors: 4 times, Paper: 0 times (NEVER used in 17 rounds!)\n\n4. Critical analysis - my prediction was RIGHT!\n   - They DID break their 5-round rock streak with scissors, exactly as they did before\n   - This confirms their pattern: they break long rock streaks with scissors\n   - My strategic thinking was correct, but I chose the wrong counter-move\n\n5. Updated pattern insights:\n   - They've now played scissors 4 times, always as streak-breakers\n   - After scissors, they ALWAYS return to rock (100% consistent)\n   - They have NEVER played paper in 17 rounds\n\n6. Historical post-scissors behavior:\n   - Round 2 (scissors) \u2192 Round 3 (rock)\n   - Round 5 (scissors) \u2192 Round 6 (rock)  \n   - Round 11 (scissors) \u2192 Round 12 (rock)\n   - Pattern suggests: Round 17 (scissors) \u2192 Round 18 (rock)\n\n7. For round 18, based on their 100% consistent scissors\u2192rock pattern:\n   - They will almost certainly play rock\n   - I should play paper to win +1 point\n   - This is my best chance to start recovering from -9 points\n\n8. Strategy validation:\n   - If they play rock (following their scissors\u2192rock pattern): Paper wins +1\n   - If they break pattern and play scissors again: Paper loses -3\n   - If they finally play paper: Paper ties for 0\n\n9. Given their perfect consistency in returning to rock after scissors, and my desperate need for positive points, paper is the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat the rock they're very likely to play based on their consistent scissors\u2192rock pattern.\n\n[move] paper"

Round results so far:\n   - Previous total score: -9 points\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Current total score: -8 points\n\n2.

MAJOR pattern shift analysis:\n   - They played scissors TWICE in a row (rounds 17-18)\n   - This breaks their historical pattern of scissors\u2192rock\n   - Previously, they ALWAYS returned to rock after scissors (100% consistent)\n   - This is the first time they've played consecutive scissors\n\n4. What this means:\n   - Their behavior is evolving/changing\n   - The scissors\u2192rock pattern I relied on has been broken\n   - They might be developing a new strategy\n   - They STILL have never played paper in 18 rounds\n\n5. New pattern considerations:\n   - Are they switching to a scissors-heavy strategy?\n   - Will they continue with more scissors?\n   - Will they return to rock?\n   - Will they finally introduce paper?\n\n6. For round 19, I need to predict their next move:\n   - If they continue with scissors: I should play rock (+3 points - maximum reward!)\n   - If they return to rock: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If they finally play paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n7. Strategic analysis:\n   - They just played scissors twice, which is unprecedented\n   - Rock still dominates their overall pattern (13/18 = 72%)\n   - But their recent behavior shows they might be shifting strategy\n\n8. Risk/reward analysis:\n   - Playing rock: Wins big vs scissors (+3), loses vs paper (-3), ties vs rock (0)\n   - Playing paper: Wins vs rock (+1), loses big vs scissors (-3), ties vs paper (0)\n   - Playing scissors: Wins vs paper (+1), loses vs rock (-1), ties vs scissors (0)\n\n9. Given they just played scissors twice (new behavior) and I need to recover from -8 points, playing rock gives me the chance for maximum reward (+3) if they continue their new scissors trend.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially get +3 points if they continue with scissors, capitalizing on their apparent new pattern.\n\n[move] rock"

CRITICAL pattern evolution:\n   - They've now played scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 17-18-19)\n   - This is completely unprecedented in their behavior\n   - They've shifted from rock-dominant to a scissors streak\n   - They STILL have never played paper in 19 rounds\n\n4. Major strategic shift analysis:\n   - Previous pattern: Mostly rock with occasional scissors breaks\n   - New pattern: Extended scissors streak (3 in a row)\n   - This suggests they've changed their entire strategy\n   - They might have realized I was predicting their rock-heavy pattern\n\n5. Current situation:\n   - I'm at -9 points and desperately need to recover\n   - They're on a 3-round scissors streak\n   - If this continues, I need to play rock to beat scissors (+3 points each time)\n   - But I just tried that and lost because I played rock when they played scissors\n\n6. Wait, let me recheck the scoring from round 19:\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n   - I played rock, they played scissors, so they won +1, I lost -1\n   - This is correct - scissors beats rock\n\n7. For round 20 strategy:\n   - If they continue scissors (4th in a row): I should play rock (+3 points - wait, that's wrong!)\n   - Let me recheck: Scissors beats rock (-1 for me), Rock beats paper (+3 for me), Paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - So if they play scissors: I should play ROCK to win +3? No, that's wrong!\n\n8. Let me recalculate the rules correctly:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors  \n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper\n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\n9.

Incredible pattern development:\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row (rounds 17-20)\n   - This is a complete strategy shift from their previous rock dominance\n   - They're now on their longest scissors streak ever\n   - They STILL have never played paper in 20 rounds\n\n4. Strategic analysis of their evolution:\n   - Started rock-heavy (13/16 = 81% through round 16)\n   - Completely switched to scissors-only for last 4 rounds\n   - This might be a deliberate counter-strategy\n   - They may have noticed my attempts to predict their rock pattern\n\n5. Current situation assessment:\n   - I'm slowly recovering from -8 points (was at -9)\n   - Their 4-round scissors streak is unprecedented\n   - If they continue with scissors, I should play paper (+1 point each time)\n   - But will they continue this new pattern?\n\n6. Pattern prediction for round 21:\n   - Will they continue scissors (5th in a row)?\n   - Will they return to rock (their historical favorite)?\n   - Will they finally introduce paper after 20 rounds?\n\n7. Risk analysis:\n   - If they play scissors again: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0), Scissors wins (+1)\n   - If they finally play paper: Paper ties (0), Rock wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1)\n\n8. Given their current 4-round scissors streak and my successful counter with paper in round 20, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (momentum)\n   - Switch to rock to counter my expected paper\n   - Finally try paper (though they've avoided it for 20 rounds)\n\n9. The safest approach given their recent scissors dominance is to continue with paper. Even if they switch to rock, I only lose 3 points, but if they continue scissors, I gain 1 point toward recovery.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat scissors if they continue their streak, accepting the risk of a big loss if they switch to rock.\n\n[move] paper"

Decision factors:\n   - They might break their 5-streak pattern (like they did before)\n   - But my recovery depends on them continuing scissors\n   - The risk of -3 if they switch to rock is significant\n   - However, they've shown strong commitment to this new scissors strategy\n\n10.

Critical pattern analysis - my prediction was RIGHT:\n   - They DID break their 5-scissors streak with rock, just like they broke their 5-rock streak with scissors\n   - This confirms they tend to break long streaks at the 5-round mark\n   - They returned to rock after their scissors streak, similar to returning to rock after previous scissors plays\n   - They STILL have never played paper in 22 rounds\n\n4. Historical pattern confirmation:\n   - 5-rock streak (rounds 6-10) \u2192 switched to scissors (round 11)  \n   - 5-scissors streak (rounds 17-21) \u2192 switched to rock (round 22)\n   - This shows consistent streak-breaking behavior at 5 rounds\n\n5.

Post-streak behavior analysis:\n   - After breaking scissors streaks historically, they usually return to rock\n   - After breaking rock streaks historically, they usually return to scissors\n   - They just broke scissors with rock, so they might continue with rock or return to scissors\n\n7.

Wait, let me double-check what beats what:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for paper)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 for rock, -3 for paper)\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors)\n\n9. So if they play rock: I should play paper (+1)\n   If they play scissors: I should play paper (+1)\n   If they play paper: I should play scissors (+1)\n\n10.

Historical behavior after streak breaks:\n   - After breaking their 5-rock streak with scissors (round 11), they immediately returned to rock (round 12)\n   - After breaking their 5-scissors streak with rock (round 22), they're continuing with rock (round 23)\n   - This suggests they might continue building another rock streak\n\n5. Recovery progress:\n   - I'm slowly climbing back from -10 to -9 points\n   - I correctly predicted their continuation with rock in round 23\n   - I need to keep making smart predictions to continue recovery\n\n6. Pattern prediction for round 24:\n   - Will they continue with rock (making it 3 in a row)?\n   - Will they switch back to scissors?\n   - Will they finally introduce paper after 23 rounds?\n\n7. Strategic analysis:\n   - They have a 2-round rock streak starting after their scissors phase\n   - Historically, they've built longer rock streaks (their longest was 5)\n   - Rock is still their most frequent move overall (15/23 = 65%)\n\n8. Move analysis for round 24:\n   - If they play rock: Scissors wins (+1), Paper loses (-3), Rock ties (0)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper wins (+1), Rock loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)  \n   - If they play paper: Scissors wins (+1), Rock wins (+3), Paper ties (0)\n\n9. Given their tendency to build rock streaks and their current 2-rock sequence, continuing with rock seems likely. Playing scissors would give me +1 point and continue my recovery.\n\n10. The risk is manageable - if they switch to scissors, I only tie (0 points), and if they finally play paper, I still win (+1).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely continued rock play and gain another +1 point toward recovery.\n\n[move] scissors"
