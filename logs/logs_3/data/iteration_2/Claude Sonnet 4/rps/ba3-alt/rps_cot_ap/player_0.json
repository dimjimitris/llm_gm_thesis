Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper and Scissors only give +1/-1 points.\n\n3. **Consider opponent behavior:**\n   Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a established strategy yet. They might:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Pick something that \"feels\" strong (like Rock)\n   - Go with a common first choice\n\n4. **Evaluate risk vs reward:**\n   - If I play Rock: High reward (+3) if I win, high penalty (-3) if I lose\n   - If I play Paper: Moderate reward (+1) if I win, high penalty (-3) if opponent plays Rock\n   - If I play Scissors: Moderate reward (+1) if I win, moderate penalty (-1) if I lose\n\n5. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   Many new players tend to choose Rock as their first move (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\"). If my opponent chooses Rock, Paper would give me +3 points. The risk is manageable since even if they choose Scissors, I only lose -1 point.\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best risk-adjusted expected value against a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The Scissors phase has been exactly 3 rounds, matching their Paper phase length. The probability still favors continuation for one more round, and the expected value of Paper remains positive.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that if they do switch, Rock would be their most logical choice to counter my successful Paper strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Paper - the pattern probability still favors Scissors continuation.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They seem to be in an extended commitment to Scissors.\n\n8. **Strategic decision reasoning:**\n   The tie in round 17 might actually encourage them to continue with Scissors since it didn't result in a loss. Their pattern extension suggests strong commitment to the current strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Paper to continue exploiting the extended Scissors pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've shown they won't switch even after 5+ losses, so one more loss is unlikely to trigger a change.\n\n8. **Strategic reasoning:**\n   This opponent has entered an almost irrational commitment to Scissors. Their pattern behavior has shifted from strategic switching to stubborn persistence. This creates a highly exploitable situation.\n\nFinal decision: Continue with Paper to exploit their irrational Scissors commitment.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
