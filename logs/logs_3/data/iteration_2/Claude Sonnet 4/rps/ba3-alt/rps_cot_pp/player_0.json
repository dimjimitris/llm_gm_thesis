    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often don't have a clear strategy\n   - They might choose randomly or go with intuitive choices\n   - Rock is a common first choice for many players (psychological tendency)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock, I win big (+3)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I lose small (-1)\n   - If I play paper and they play paper, it's a tie (0)\n\n5. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper has the potential for the biggest gain (+3) with moderate risk\n   - Even if I lose with paper, the penalty is only -1\n   - This seems like the best risk-reward ratio for an opening move\n\n[move] Paper - Going for the high-value win against a potentially rock-heavy fresh player while limiting downside risk.\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost and got -1 points (not +1 as the hint incorrectly stated)\n   - The opponent won with scissors beating paper\n\n2. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - They chose scissors on their first move\n   - This could indicate they're not following the \"rock-heavy fresh player\" pattern I expected\n   - They might be thinking strategically about the payoff structure\n\n3. Consider the opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might have noticed that rock gives +3/-3 (high risk/reward)\n   - Scissors and paper both give +1/-1 when they win\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper but loses to rock\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If they stick with scissors, I should play rock (+1 for me)\n   - If they switch to rock (going for the big payoff), I should play paper (+3 for me)\n   - If they switch to paper, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Since they won last round with scissors, they might repeat it\n   - Or they might anticipate that I'll counter with rock, so they could switch to rock\n   - Rock seems like a good choice - it beats scissors (if they repeat) and only risks -3 if they play paper\n\n[move] Rock - Countering their previous scissors choice while being ready to capitalize if they stick with their winning move.\n"
