Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both\n\n2. Notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4. Many new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological reasons (it feels \"strong\" or \"solid\").\n\n5. However, if they do choose rock, I want to avoid paper (which would give them +3 points against me).\n\n6. The safest high-reward strategy is to play rock myself, because:\n   - If they play paper, I lose only 3 points (but this seems less likely for a first move)\n   - If they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given the high reward potential of rock (+3 if opponent plays paper) and that it's a common first choice, rock seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] Rock"

Consider the opponent's psychology/programming:\n   - Either they're using a fixed algorithm that heavily favors scissors\n   - Or they have some strategic reason for sticking with scissors (unlikely given losses)\n   - Or they're not processing the game results to adapt their strategy\n\n5. Mathematical assessment:\n   - With 91% scissors usage, the probability of another scissors is extremely high\n   - Paper vs scissors gives me +1 point (guaranteed win)\n   - No rational reason to deviate from this winning approach\n\n6. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Staying with paper: ~91% chance of +1, ~9% chance of 0 or +3\n   - Changing strategy: Likely to reduce expected value given their pattern\n\n7.

Analyze the pattern strength:\n   - They've played scissors 7 times in a row since their anomaly\n   - The single paper play becomes increasingly insignificant\n   - This appears to be either a bot with heavy scissors bias or completely non-adaptive play\n   - Zero evidence of strategic adjustment despite consistent losses\n\n3.

Statistical confidence assessment:\n   - With 92% scissors usage over 12 rounds, predicting scissors next round is highly reliable\n   - The pattern has been consistent for 7 consecutive rounds\n   - No indication of change or adaptation\n\n5.

Analyze the pattern change significance:\n   - They went from 11 scissors out of 12 rounds to suddenly playing rock\n   - This suggests they WERE learning and finally adapted\n   - The timing suggests they recognized my paper strategy and countered it\n   - This was a strategic switch, not random\n\n3. Evaluate what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They are adaptive, just slow to change\n   - They can recognize patterns and counter them\n   - They may have been building confidence before making a major strategy shift\n   - They're not a simple bot - they can learn and respond\n\n4.

Review what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - Paper beats scissors, so they won +1 and I lost -1\n   - They successfully continued with their paper strategy from the previous round\n\n2. Analyze their recent strategic evolution:\n   - Rounds 18-21: 4 consecutive scissors (mostly losing to my paper)\n   - Round 22: Switched to paper (tied with my paper)\n   - Round 23: Continued with paper (beat my scissors)\n   - They've now found a successful counter to my dominant paper strategy\n\n3. Consider their current strategic position:\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors\n   - They may recognize that paper has been generally successful in this game\n   - They might continue with paper since it's now working for them\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with rock and switch accordingly\n\n4. Evaluate the current game dynamics:\n   - Both of us have shown we can adapt strategies\n   - They've moved from scissors-heavy to experimenting with paper\n   - I need to respond to their new paper usage\n\n5. Assess my strategic options:\n   - If they continue with paper: Scissors beats paper (+1)\n   - If they switch to scissors: Paper beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper beats rock (+3)\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Scissors vs paper: +1 (if they stick with their successful paper)\n   - Scissors vs rock: -1 (manageable penalty)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 (tie)\n   - Rock vs paper: -3 (high penalty, avoid this)\n\n7. Strategic decision: Continue with scissors to counter their likely continued paper usage, since they just succeeded with it and may repeat the winning strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against paper, while the other winning moves only give +1 point.\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new), they might not immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure.\n\n4. Many new players in rock-paper-scissors tend to choose rock as their first move due to psychological reasons (it feels \"strong\" or \"solid\").\n\n5. However, if they do choose rock, I want to avoid paper (which would give them +3 points against me).\n\n6. The safest high-reward strategy is to play rock myself, because:\n   - If they play paper, I lose only 3 points (but this seems less likely for a first move)\n   - If they play scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7. Given the high reward potential of rock (+3 if opponent plays paper) and that it's a common first choice, rock seems like the optimal opening move.\n\n[move] Rock",

Review what just happened:\n   - My opponent finally switched from scissors to rock\n   - Rock beats paper, giving them +3 and me -3 (the maximum penalty)\n   - This broke their extremely strong scissors pattern after 7 consecutive plays\n\n2. Analyze the pattern change significance:\n   - They went from 11 scissors out of 12 rounds to suddenly playing rock\n   - This suggests they WERE learning and finally adapted\n   - The timing suggests they recognized my paper strategy and countered it\n   - This was a strategic switch, not random\n\n3. Evaluate what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They are adaptive, just slow to change\n   - They can recognize patterns and counter them\n   - They may have been building confidence before making a major strategy shift\n   - They're not a simple bot - they can learn and respond\n\n4. Predict their next move:\n   - They just succeeded with rock against my paper (+3 points for them)\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked so well\n   - Or they might expect me to counter with paper (which beats rock for +3)\n   - They could revert to scissors or try paper\n\n5. Consider my optimal response:\n   - If they play rock again: Paper beats rock (+3 for me, maximum reward)\n   - If they play scissors: Paper beats scissors (+1 for me)\n   - If they play paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 for me)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Paper vs rock: +3 (maximum reward)\n   - Paper vs scissors: +1 (good reward)\n   - Paper vs paper: 0 (tie)\n   - Scissors vs rock: -1 (manageable loss)\n   - Scissors vs paper: +1 (good reward)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 (tie)\n\n7.
