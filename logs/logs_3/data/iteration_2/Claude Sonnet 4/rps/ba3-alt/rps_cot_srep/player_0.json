    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might not have developed any particular strategy yet, so their move is likely random or based on intuition.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward for each move:\n   - Rock: High risk, high reward (can win +3 or lose -3)\n   - Paper: Medium risk, low reward (can win +1 or lose -3)  \n   - Scissors: Low risk, low reward (can win +1 or lose -1)\n\n5. Since the opponent is fresh/new, they're unlikely to expect aggressive play. Rock offers the highest potential payoff (+3), and against a random opponent, I have a 1/3 chance of winning big, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing.\n\n6. The expected value calculation: Rock has potential outcomes of +3, 0, -3 with equal probability, giving expected value of 0. But the upside is much larger than the downside of other moves.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock to maximize my potential points.\n\n[move] rock"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - According to the rules, scissors beats rock (+1 for opponent, -1 for me)\n   - Wait - this contradicts what I expected. Let me re-read the rules.\n\n2. Re-examine the rules:\n   - \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So scissors does beat rock, not the other way around like in traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - This means: Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper (circular)\n\n3. Analyze the corrected payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1/-1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3/-3  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1/-1\n\n4. Consider what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They played scissors against my rock\n   - This could be random, or they might understand the unusual rule set\n   - Since they're described as \"fresh,\" it was likely random or intuitive\n\n5. Plan my strategy for this round:\n   - Rock still offers the highest reward (+3) when it wins against paper\n   - But it also has the highest penalty (-3) when it loses to paper\n   - Scissors and paper both offer +1 when winning, but scissors only risks -1 when losing (vs paper risking -3)\n\n6. Given the opponent is still fresh and their previous move was scissors, I should consider they might repeat or choose randomly again. Playing paper would beat scissors (+1) and only risk -1 against rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially beat scissors while limiting my downside risk.\n\n[move] paper"

The rules are actually traditional rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock  \n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - But with different point values: rock wins give +3/-3, others give +1/-1\n\n4. Analyze my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played scissors\n   - Round 2: They played scissors again\n   - This suggests either they have a preference for scissors, or it's coincidence\n\n5. Consider my strategy:\n   - If opponent tends to play scissors, I should play rock to win +3 points\n   - Rock beating scissors gives the maximum reward\n   - Even if I'm wrong, the worst case is losing -1 to paper\n\n6. The opponent playing scissors twice suggests either a pattern or they're sticking with what they know.
