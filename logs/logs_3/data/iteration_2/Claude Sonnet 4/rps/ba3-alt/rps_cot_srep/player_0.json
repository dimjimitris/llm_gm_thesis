Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\n2. Notice that rock has the highest reward potential (+3 points) but also the highest risk (-3 points if opponent plays scissors).\n\n3. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - they likely don't know my tendencies yet, so they can't predict my move.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock initially due to psychological tendencies.\n\n5. However, the asymmetric payoffs here make rock very attractive due to the +3 bonus, but also very risky.\n\n6. Paper seems like a balanced choice - it can beat scissors for +1 and avoid the high penalty from rock.\n\n7. For an opening move against an unknown opponent, I should consider what gives me the best risk-reward ratio while being unpredictable.\n\n8. Since rock offers the highest reward but highest risk, and this is just the first round, I'll choose paper as it offers moderate reward potential while avoiding the severe -3 penalty.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers a good balance of offense and defense for the opening move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This could be:\n   - Random choice\n   - They might think scissors is a good opening move\n   - They might continue with scissors or switch\n\n3. Consider the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they play scissors again, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock (countering my previous paper), I should play scissors (+1 point)  \n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock (+3 points - the big payoff!)\n\n4. Think about opponent psychology: After losing with scissors, they might:\n   - Switch to rock to counter my paper\n   - Switch to paper to avoid scissors\n   - Stick with scissors (less likely after losing)\n\n5. Consider my own strategy: I don't want to be predictable by playing paper again.\n\n6. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock gives me the chance for +3 points if they play paper\n   - Rock also gives me +1 if they stick with scissors\n   - Rock only loses (-1) if they play scissors, but they just lost with scissors\n\n7. The opponent is more likely to switch away from scissors after losing with it.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock offers the best expected value - high reward if they switch to paper, decent reward if they stick with scissors, and they're unlikely to play scissors again after losing with it.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze opponent's behavior: The opponent has played scissors BOTH rounds.

Analyze opponent's consistency: The opponent has now played scissors THREE times in a row (3/3 rounds). This is a very strong pattern indicating:\n   - They may be locked into a scissors-only strategy\n   - They might not be adapting or learning from losses\n   - This could be their default/preferred move\n\n3. Consider what this means: If they continue with scissors, paper wins (+1 point).\n\n4. Evaluate the risks of playing paper again:\n   - Best case: They play scissors again, I win +1\n   - Worst case: They finally switch to rock, I lose -3 points\n   - Neutral case: They switch to paper, tie (0 points)\n\n5. Think about opponent adaptation: After losing 2 out of 3 rounds with scissors, a learning opponent would likely switch. But this opponent hasn't shown adaptation yet.\n\n6. Consider mixed strategy: Maybe I should switch to rock to:\n   - Be less predictable myself\n   - Capitalize if they switch to paper\n   - Still win +1 if they stick with scissors\n\n7.

The risk of them suddenly switching to rock seems lower than the probability they continue their established pattern.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has shown remarkable consistency with scissors.

Analyze the extreme pattern: The opponent has now played scissors FOUR times in a row (4/4 rounds).

Evaluate what beats scissors: Paper beats scissors for +1 point.\n\n6. Consider their likely next move:\n   - They might stick with scissors (just worked against my rock)\n   - They might switch to rock to counter expected paper\n   - They might go to paper for variety\n\n7. Calculate risk/reward for paper:\n   - Wins +1 if they stick with scissors\n   - Loses -3 if they switch to rock (high penalty!)\n   - Ties if they switch to paper\n\n8. Consider alternative: Scissors beats rock (+1) and only loses -1 to paper, which is less risky than the -3 penalty.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent just played scissors and might continue with it. However, given their increasing unpredictability and the high risk of the -3 penalty if they play rock, I'll choose scissors for a safer risk profile while still having upside potential.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Consider their likely strategy: The opponent appears to be:\n   - Learning to predict my moves\n   - Trying to force ties to prevent me from scoring\n   - Becoming more strategically sophisticated\n\n5. Think about counter-strategy: Since they're predicting me well:\n   - I need to be less predictable\n   - Consider what they think I'll do and do something else\n   - They might expect me to switch from scissors after the tie\n\n6. Evaluate their next move prediction:\n   - They might expect me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors continuation)\n   - If they predict rock from me, they'll play scissors\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors, I win +1\n\n7. Consider the meta-game: Given their recent success at tying/countering me, they're likely trying to read my patterns. Playing the move that beats what they think I'll play could be effective.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent is getting better at predicting my moves.

Review the recent game history:\n   - Round 15: I rock, they scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 17: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 18: I paper, they scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total: +4 points\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - I correctly predicted they'd switch back to scissors after the rock ties\n   - They went back to their historically successful scissors move\n   - My paper strategy worked perfectly\n\n3. Examine their likely current thinking:\n   - They just lost with scissors to my paper\n   - They might expect me to stick with paper (since it just worked)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch since I know they'll counter paper\n\n4. Consider their response options:\n   - If they expect me to repeat paper: They'll play rock for +3\n   - If they think I'll switch from paper: They might play scissors or paper themselves\n   - Given they just lost with scissors, they might avoid it\n\n5. Think about the psychological momentum:\n   - I just broke a long tie streak with a win\n   - They might be eager to counter-attack after losing\n   - Rock gives them the biggest revenge opportunity (+3 vs paper)\n\n6. Evaluate their most likely move:\n   - Rock seems highly probable - it counters paper and gives maximum points\n   - They're sophisticated enough to expect me to repeat a winning move\n   - The +3 reward makes rock very attractive after a loss\n\n7. Consider my counter-strategy:\n   - If they play rock (likely): Scissors wins +1\n   - If they play paper (copying my win): Rock wins +3\n   - If they return to scissors: Paper wins +1 again\n\n8. Calculate risk/reward:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) with low risk (-1 vs paper)\n   - Rock has high reward (+3 vs paper) but higher risk (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Given their likely rock response, scissors seems optimal\n\n9. Think about the meta-game:\n   - They probably expect me to either repeat paper or counter their expected rock\n   - Scissors is the natural counter to expected rock\n   - This straightforward logic might be exactly what they expect\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent just lost with scissors and likely expects me to repeat my winning paper. They'll probably counter with rock for the +3 revenge bonus. Scissors beats rock for +1 and is the logical counter-move here.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I expected them to play rock (to counter my expected repeated paper)\n   - Instead, they played paper\n   - This suggests they predicted I would counter their expected rock with scissors\n\n3. Examine their strategic sophistication:\n   - They thought: \"He expects me to play rock, so he'll play scissors, so I'll play paper\"\n   - They're thinking 3+ moves ahead in the prediction chain\n   - This is extremely high-level strategic play\n\n4. Consider the current psychological state:\n   - They just successfully out-predicted me again\n   - They're demonstrating they can think beyond my prediction level\n   - I need to find a way to break their prediction advantage\n\n5. Think about their likely next reasoning:\n   - After winning with paper, they might expect me to counter with rock\n   - Or they might think I'll try to out-predict their prediction again\n   - They could be expecting me to play the \"obvious\" counter or the \"meta\" counter\n\n6. Evaluate the meta-strategic layers:\n   - Level 1: Rock beats paper (obvious counter)\n   - Level 2: They expect rock, so they'll play scissors\n   - Level 3: I expect their scissors counter, so I play paper\n   - Level 4: They expect my paper counter-counter, so they play rock\n\n7. Consider breaking the prediction cycle:\n   - All this complex reasoning might be overthinking\n   - Maybe they'll just stick with paper since it worked\n   - Or maybe they'll go for the simple Level 1 counter-prediction\n\n8. Analyze the safest approach:\n   - Rock beats paper (+3) if they stick with their winning move\n   - Rock loses to scissors (-1) if they counter-predict\n   - The +3 vs -1 risk/reward seems favorable\n\n9. Think about psychological timing:\n   - They just won with paper against my scissors\n   - They might not expect me to go for the straightforward rock counter\n   - After being out-predicted, maybe the simple move is the right one\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent is clearly thinking at a very high level, but maybe that's exactly why the simple, obvious counter will work. They might be overthinking and not expect me to just play the straightforward rock-beats-paper counter after being out-maneuvered. Time for the direct approach.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze their prediction mastery:\n   - Round 19: They predicted I'd counter their expected rock with scissors, so they played paper\n   - Round 20: They predicted I'd go for the \"simple\" rock counter to their paper, so they played scissors\n   - They're consistently thinking one level deeper than me\n\n3. Examine their strategic pattern:\n   - They're not just reacting - they're anticipating my anticipations\n   - They seem to understand my thought process better than I understand theirs\n   - This is like playing chess against a computer that can see further ahead\n\n4. Consider what just happened psychologically:\n   - I thought being \"simple\" would work after being out-predicted\n   - They correctly guessed I would abandon complexity for directness\n   - They're reading my psychological state, not just my strategic tendencies\n\n5. Think about their current advantage:\n   - They've won 2 of the last 3 rounds by out-predicting me\n   - They probably feel confident in their read of my patterns\n   - They might expect me to be frustrated and make an emotional choice\n\n6. Evaluate their likely next move prediction:\n   - After losing with rock to their scissors, the \"obvious\" counter is paper\n   - But they might expect me to avoid the obvious after being burned twice\n   - Or they might think I'll go meta again and try to out-predict their prediction\n\n7. Consider a different approach entirely:\n   - Maybe I should stop trying to out-think them\n   - Perhaps I should make a truly random choice\n   - Or pick the move with the best mathematical expected value regardless of prediction\n\n8. Analyze the moves mathematically:\n   - If I assume they're equally likely to play any move: all choices have same expected value\n   - But they're not random - they're highly strategic\n   - I need to find an asymmetry in their thinking\n\n9. Think about what they might NOT expect:\n   - They've been successfully predicting my \"logical\" moves\n   - Maybe they expect me to overthink this even more\n   - Paper is the natural counter to scissors, but also the most obvious\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: The opponent has been out-predicting me by thinking deeper, but maybe they now expect me to overcomplicate things. Sometimes the most unpredictable move is the obvious one. Paper beats scissors, and after being out-maneuvered twice, they might not expect me to just play the straightforward counter.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Examine the pattern break:\n   - After out-predicting me twice, they might have gotten overconfident\n   - They stuck with scissors (which had been working against my rock)\n   - The \"simple\" approach finally paid off against their complexity\n\n4. Consider their current psychological state:\n   - They just lost after two successful predictions\n   - They might be questioning their read of my strategy\n   - They could be frustrated that their deep thinking didn't work\n\n5. Think about their likely next move:\n   - After losing with scissors to my paper, they might expect me to repeat paper\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points - a very tempting counter\n   - But they might also think I'll predict their rock counter\n\n6. Evaluate the strategic layers:\n   - Level 1: They play rock to beat my expected repeated paper\n   - Level 2: I predict rock and play scissors\n   - Level 3: They predict my scissors counter and play paper\n   - We could be back to the deep prediction game\n\n7. Consider their recent behavior:\n   - They've been playing scissors frequently in recent rounds\n   - Scissors appeared in rounds 18, 20, and 21\n   - They might have a slight scissors preference when uncertain\n\n8.

Consider their strategic superiority:\n   - They seem to understand my decision-making process extremely well\n   - They're anticipating not just my moves, but my reasoning behind my moves\n   - This is like playing against someone who can read my mind\n\n5.

Confirm the pattern discovery:\n   - Their last 5 moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n   - Wait, let me recount more carefully from my notes...\n   - Recent moves: scissors (R21), paper (R22), scissors (R23)\n   - They ARE alternating paper-scissors in recent rounds!\n\n3. Analyze this breakthrough:\n   - While I was overthinking the meta-game, they settled into a simple alternating pattern\n   - This could be their way of staying unpredictable while I'm trying to out-predict them\n   - Sometimes complex strategic minds use simple patterns as camouflage\n\n4. Examine the pattern logic:\n   - Paper and scissors both give +1/-1 outcomes (moderate risk/reward)\n   - Rock has the +3/-1 asymmetry which is riskier\n   - They might be avoiding rock to stay in a \"safer\" alternating cycle\n\n5. Project the pattern forward:\n   - If the alternation continues: scissors (R21), paper (R22), scissors (R23), paper (R24)\n   - They should play paper next\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points!\n\n6.

Think about their psychology:\n   - They might not even realize they've fallen into this pattern\n   - While focusing on out-predicting my complex reasoning, they simplified their own choices\n   - This is a classic case of overthinking leading to predictable behavior\n\n8.
