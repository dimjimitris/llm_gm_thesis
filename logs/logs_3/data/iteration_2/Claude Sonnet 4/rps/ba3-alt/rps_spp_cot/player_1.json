    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n   - Rock also has the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no prior information about their tendencies\n   - Against an unknown opponent, I should consider what gives me the best expected value\n   - Rock has both the highest reward and highest risk\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's often the default choice)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I tie with rock, lose badly with scissors, win with paper\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I win big with rock, tie with paper, lose with scissors\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I lose with rock, win with paper, tie with scissors\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Rock offers the potential for the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - Against a fresh player with no established pattern, taking the high-reward option seems optimal\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors rock for maximum point accumulation\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent chose rock in round 1\n   - This could indicate they also recognized rock's high payoff potential\n   - Or they might be a predictable player who defaults to rock\n   - Fresh players sometimes stick with their first choice or have simple patterns\n\n3. Consider my strategic options:\n   - If opponent chooses rock again: Paper wins (+3 to me, -3 to them)\n   - If opponent switches to paper: Rock wins (+3 to me, -3 to them)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors: Rock wins (+1 to me, -1 to them)\n\n4. Evaluate the best counter-strategy:\n   - Paper beats rock and gives me the maximum +3 points\n   - If the opponent is likely to repeat rock or has a rock tendency, paper is optimal\n   - Even if they switch, paper only loses badly to scissors (which seems less likely given their rock choice)\n\n5. Decision:\n   - Paper maximizes my expected value against a player who just chose rock\n   - It directly counters the move they just made\n   - The high payoff (+3) makes it worth the risk\n\n[move] Paper"

Current situation analysis:\n   - Round 7: Won scissors vs rock (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: Tied paper vs paper (0 points)\n   - Round 9: Lost rock vs scissors (-1 point)\n   - Round 10: Lost paper vs rock (-3 points)\n   - Round 11: Won scissors vs rock (+1 point)\n   - Total score: -2 points (recovering from -3)\n\n2. Critical pattern discovery:\n   - I've now won TWICE with scissors vs rock (rounds 7 and 11)\n   - Both wins came when I abandoned complex logical reasoning\n   - Both times the opponent chose rock when I chose scissors\n   - The opponent seems to default to rock in certain situations\n\n3. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - When I use simple/unexpected choices: they choose rock\n   - When I use logical optimization: they counter-predict successfully\n   - Rock appears to be their \"safe\" or default choice when uncertain\n   - They chose rock after their big win in round 10, suggesting confidence/repetition\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - The opponent chooses rock when they can't predict my move well\n   - My wins come from choosing scissors in these unpredictable moments\n   - But if I repeat scissors, they might catch on and choose rock deliberately to counter\n   - I need to maintain unpredictability while exploiting their rock tendency\n\n5. Decision strategy:\n   - They just chose rock again, reinforcing the pattern\n   - If they expect me to repeat scissors (since it just won), they might choose rock to counter\n   - But paper beats rock and gives me +3 points (maximum reward)\n   - Risk: if they choose scissors, I lose -1\n   - The high reward potential and their rock pattern makes paper optimal\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyze the opponent's rock pattern:\n   - Round 7: Rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 9: Scissors \n   - Round 10: Rock (I lost -3 with paper)\n   - Round 11: Rock (I won with scissors)\n   - Round 12: Rock (I just lost -3 with paper)\n   - They've chosen rock 4 out of last 6 rounds!\n\n3. Critical realization:\n   - The opponent heavily favors rock\n   - When I choose scissors vs their rock: I WIN (+1)\n   - When I choose paper vs their rock: I LOSE BIG (-3)\n   - My two wins both came from scissors vs rock\n   - My two biggest losses came from paper vs rock\n\n4. Simple truth emerges:\n   - Stop overthinking this\n   - The opponent likes rock\n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - I've proven this works twice already\n   - Paper vs rock has failed me twice catastrophically\n\n5. Clear decision:\n   - Choose scissors again\n   - It's beaten their rock twice before\n   - Even if they switch strategies, scissors only loses -1 vs rock (not -3)\n   - I need to stop the bleeding and get back to winning\n   - Trust what has actually worked\n\n[move] Scissors"

Key insight about opponent behavior:\n   - They're not just favoring rock - they're learning and adapting\n   - When I found a winning pattern (scissors vs rock), they changed\n   - They're counter-adapting to my successful strategies\n   - This suggests they're actively analyzing my choices\n\n4. Strategic reassessment:\n   - The opponent just chose paper to beat my scissors\n   - If they expect me to continue with scissors, they might stick with paper\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock (to beat paper), they might choose scissors\n   - Rock beats paper and gives me +3 points (maximum reward I desperately need)\n\n5. Decision logic:\n   - I'm -6 points and need high-value wins\n   - Rock beats paper for +3 points\n   - Even if they choose scissors, I only lose -1 (better than -3)\n   - The opponent just used paper, so rock is the natural counter\n   - I need to take the high-reward risk to recover\n\n[move] Rock"
