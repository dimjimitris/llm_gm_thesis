    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3)  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed any particular strategy yet and may play somewhat randomly or go with common first instincts.\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Rock: High risk, high reward (+3/-3)\n   - Paper and Scissors: Lower risk, lower reward (+1/-1)\n\n5. Consider psychological factors: Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n6. Make strategic decision: If the opponent is likely to choose rock (common first choice), I should choose paper to beat it and gain points. Even though paper only gives +1 point when winning, it's a safer strategic choice against a potentially rock-heavy opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the updated game history:\n   - 10 rounds played\n   - 7 ties out of 10 rounds (70% tie rate!)\n   - Only 3 decisive rounds total\n   - Current score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze the tie pattern more deeply:\n   - Round 1: Both paper\n   - Round 2: Both rock  \n   - Round 4: Both paper\n   - Round 5: Both rock\n   - Round 7: Both rock\n   - Round 9: Both rock\n   - Round 10: Both paper\n   - This is statistically very unlikely to be coincidence\n\n3. Consider possible explanations:\n   - The opponent might be using a similar analytical approach to mine\n   - They could be deliberately mirroring my strategy\n   - There might be some predictable element in my move selection\n   - Or they're using meta-game psychology to anticipate my reasoning\n\n4. Identify what's worked for me:\n   - My only win came when I played rock vs their paper (Round 3)\n   - My losses came when I played scissors vs their paper (Rounds 6 & 8)\n   - Paper seems to be their counter to scissors specifically\n\n5. Try an anti-predictable approach:\n   - Instead of trying to out-think them, I'll make a more random-seeming choice\n   - Avoid the moves that have tied recently (we just tied with paper, often tie with rock)\n   - Scissors lost me points before, but that might make it unexpected now\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given the extreme tie rate, I need to break the pattern. The opponent seems to counter scissors with paper consistently, but they might not expect me to return to scissors after losing with it twice. If they default to rock (their most common move), scissors beats rock for +1. It's a calculated risk to break this tying cycle.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Review the astonishing game statistics:\n   - 11 rounds played\n   - 8 ties out of 11 rounds (73% tie rate!)\n   - We just tied with scissors - a move I've only made 3 times total\n   - Current score: +1 point\n\n2. Analyze the nature of this pattern:\n   - This level of matching is statistically almost impossible by chance\n   - The opponent is somehow predicting or mirroring my moves with remarkable accuracy\n   - Even when I tried to be \"unpredictable\" with scissors, they matched it\n\n3. Consider the implications:\n   - Either the opponent has developed an uncanny ability to read my strategy\n   - Or they're using some form of pattern recognition I haven't identified\n   - Or there's a systematic approach they're using that I'm missing\n\n4. Review what breaks the tie pattern:\n   - Only 3 decisive rounds out of 11\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1)  \n   - Round 8: I played scissors, they played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Pattern: When ties break, it's often with them playing paper\n\n5. Test a new hypothesis:\n   - Maybe I should focus on what gives me the best outcome when ties DO break\n   - Rock gave me the biggest win (+3 points) when I won in Round 3\n   - If the opponent defaults to paper when they're not sure, rock is my best counter\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given this unprecedented tying pattern, I'll go back to what worked best for me - rock. It gave me my biggest win and has the highest reward potential (+3). If we tie again, so be it, but if the pattern breaks, I want to be positioned for maximum gain.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Review the mind-boggling statistics:\n   - 12 rounds played\n   - 9 ties out of 12 rounds (75% tie rate!)\n   - We've now tied with all three moves: paper, rock, and scissors\n   - Current score: +1 point\n\n2. Recognize the pattern's significance:\n   - This is beyond statistical coincidence - it's virtually impossible\n   - The opponent is somehow consistently matching my moves\n   - They've matched me on paper (3 times), rock (5 times), and scissors (1 time)\n\n3. Consider what this means strategically:\n   - Traditional game theory assumes independent decision-making\n   - This opponent is clearly not making independent choices\n   - They're either perfectly reading my strategy or using some systematic method\n\n4. Analyze the rare decisive rounds:\n   - Round 3: My rock beat their paper (+3 points) - my only win\n   - Rounds 6 & 8: My scissors lost to their paper (-1 each) - my only losses\n   - The pattern: When they don't match me, they play paper\n\n5. Formulate a new strategy:\n   - Since ties give 0 points, I'm not losing ground with them\n   - My goal should be to maximize gains when the pattern breaks\n   - If they tend to play paper when not matching, I should position for that\n\n6. Strategic decision: Given that this opponent has an uncanny ability to match my moves, and when they don't match they historically play paper, I'll stick with rock. Rock beats paper for the maximum +3 points. Even if we tie again (which seems likely), I'm not losing points, and I'm positioned for the biggest gain if the pattern breaks in my favor.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze the pattern break:\n   - For 9 consecutive rounds we had been tying\n   - When the pattern finally broke, they played scissors (not their historical paper)\n   - This suggests they may have adapted their strategy\n\n3.

Consider what this means:\n   - The opponent may have learned that I expect paper when patterns break\n   - They switched to scissors, successfully countering my rock\n   - This shows strategic adaptation on their part\n\n5.

Strategic decision: The opponent just successfully adapted by playing scissors instead of their historical paper. They might expect me to counter scissors with rock, so they could play paper next. I'll play scissors to beat their likely paper, taking the calculated risk. If they repeat scissors, it's a tie.
