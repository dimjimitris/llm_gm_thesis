    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the most valuable win:\n   - Rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - This means rock is the most rewarding move when it wins\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to common choices\n   - Rock is historically the most popular first choice in rock-paper-scissors\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely): I should play paper to win 3 points\n   - If opponent plays paper: I should play scissors to win 1 point  \n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock to win 1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3, worst case -1\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1, worst case -3\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1, worst case -1\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3) with moderate risk (-1)\n   - Against a fresh player likely to choose rock, paper is optimal\n\n[move] paper"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played rock\n   - I lost and scored -3 points\n   - This means rock beats paper (opponent got +3 points)\n\n2. Wait, let me recheck the rules:\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   - But I played paper and opponent played rock, so opponent should have won\n   - The result matches: I lost -3 points, which is correct\n\n3. Analyze opponent behavior:\n   - Opponent chose rock in round 1\n   - This could be random, or they might have a pattern\n   - Fresh players sometimes stick with what worked\n\n4. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent plays rock again: I should play paper to win +3\n   - If opponent switches to paper: I should play scissors to win +1  \n   - If opponent switches to scissors: I should play rock to win +1\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent won with rock, they might stick with it\n   - But they might also expect me to counter with paper\n   - If they expect me to play paper, they might switch to scissors\n   - However, the +3 point reward for beating paper with rock is very tempting\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper again: High reward (+3) if opponent repeats rock, but risky if they switch to scissors (-1)\n   - Playing scissors: Moderate reward, beats paper, loses to rock (-1)\n   - Playing rock: Moderate reward, beats scissors, loses badly to paper (-3)\n\n7. Decision:\n   - The high value of rock vs paper (+3/-3) makes this matchup crucial\n   - I'll stick with paper, betting opponent will repeat their winning rock strategy\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost -3 points\n   - Current score: -6 points\n\n2. Opponent behavior analysis:\n   - Opponent has played rock twice in a row\n   - They're either:\n     a) Sticking with a winning strategy\n     b) Have a strong preference for rock\n     c) Expecting me to eventually switch away from paper\n\n3. Strategic reconsideration:\n   - My logic was sound (paper beats rock for +3), but opponent keeps playing rock\n   - If opponent continues with rock, I should continue with paper\n   - But if they're about to switch, I need to anticipate their move\n\n4. Psychology consideration:\n   - Opponent has won twice with rock (+6 points total)\n   - They might think: \"This player keeps playing paper, I should keep playing rock\"\n   - OR they might think: \"They'll surely switch now, so I should switch to counter their new move\"\n\n5. Risk evaluation for this round:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock again: I lose -3 (total -9)\n   - If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose -1 (total -7) \n   - If I play rock and they play rock: Tie, 0 points (total -6)\n\n6. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent seems committed to rock\n   - Even though paper theoretically beats rock for +3, I keep losing\n   - I should either stick with my analysis or try to break their pattern\n   - Given they've played rock twice, maybe they'll finally switch - if they go to scissors, I win with rock\n\n[move] rock"

Opponent pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent has played rock three times in a row\n   - This shows a very strong commitment to rock\n   - They either have a fixed strategy or really like rock\n\n3. Strategic insight:\n   - If opponent keeps playing rock, paper is the optimal counter (+3 points)\n   - My original strategy was correct, I just got impatient after two losses\n   - The tie confirms opponent is still choosing rock\n\n4. Probability assessment:\n   - Given three rocks in a row, opponent likely will play rock again\n   - Even if they're thinking of switching, the pattern is very strong\n   - Rock players often stick with what they know\n\n5. Risk-reward calculation:\n   - Playing paper vs rock: +3 points (best possible outcome)\n   - Playing scissors vs rock: -1 points\n   - Playing rock vs rock: 0 points (tie)\n\n6.

Analyze the opponent's pattern shift:\n   - Opponent played rock 3 times, then switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they might be adapting their strategy\n   - They may have anticipated I would keep playing paper and switched to scissors to counter it\n\n3. Consider opponent's possible thinking:\n   - \"This player keeps playing paper, so I'll play scissors to beat it\"\n   - OR they're trying to break out of the rock pattern\n   - OR they're testing different moves now\n\n4. Predict next move possibilities:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll stick with paper: They might play scissors again\n   - If opponent thinks I'll switch due to their switch: They might go back to rock or try paper\n   - The pattern is now less predictable\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - If opponent plays scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent goes back to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent tries paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n7.
