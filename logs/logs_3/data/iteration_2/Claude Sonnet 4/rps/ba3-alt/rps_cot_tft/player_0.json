    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 point (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so they likely don't have an established pattern\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - However, some might choose paper thinking others will choose rock\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points (high penalty)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play paper and opponent plays rock, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play scissors and opponent plays rock, I lose 1 point\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing rock has high reward potential (+3) but also high risk (-3)\n   - Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll take a moderate risk approach\n   - I'll play paper, which beats rock (common first choice) for a decent penalty to opponent (-3 to them, +3 to me)\n\n[move] paper"

Re-examine the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - So if I played paper and opponent played scissors, I should win +1\n   - The hint confirms I won and scored 1 point - this is correct\n\n3. Analyze opponent's behavior:\n   - Opponent chose scissors in round 1\n   - This could indicate they might avoid rock (since many beginners start with rock)\n   - Or it could be random\n\n4. Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with scissors, I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock (thinking I might play paper again), I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent switches to paper, I should play scissors (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Opponent might expect me to repeat paper (since it worked)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch to rock to counter their scissors\n   - Given they played scissors first (not the typical beginner rock), they might be slightly more strategic\n   - I'll go with rock to counter if they repeat scissors, and it also beats scissors for +1\n\n[move] rock"
