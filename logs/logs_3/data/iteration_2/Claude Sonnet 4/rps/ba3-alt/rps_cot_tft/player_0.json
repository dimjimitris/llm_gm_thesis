    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. I notice that rock has the highest reward potential (+3 points when it wins against paper), but also the highest risk (-3 points when it loses to paper).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely someone new who hasn't developed patterns yet), I should consider what new players typically do:\n   - Many beginners choose rock first (it's often the default/instinctive choice)\n   - Some choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n   - Paper is less commonly chosen initially\n\n4. Given that rock gives the highest payoff (+3) when it wins, and considering that new players often choose rock, I should choose paper to counter the likely rock choice.\n\n5. If the opponent chooses rock, I win 3 points. If they choose scissors, I lose 1 point. If they choose paper, it's a tie (0 points).\n\n6. The risk-reward analysis favors choosing paper against a fresh player, as the potential gain (+3) significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\n[move] paper\n"

Previous round analysis:\n   - I chose paper, opponent chose scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (paper loses to scissors)\n   - The hint said \"You won the round\" but I actually lost based on the rules - this seems like an error in the feedback\n\n2. What I learned about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors in the first round, not the typical \"rock\" that many fresh players choose\n   - This suggests they might be thinking strategically or trying to be unpredictable\n\n3. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - If they're being unpredictable, they might switch to a different move\n   - If they think scissors worked (believing they won), they might stick with it\n   - They might expect me to counter their previous scissors with rock\n\n4. Analyzing my options:\n   - If I choose rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n   - If I choose paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n   - If I choose scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\n5. Since they chose scissors last time, and many players either repeat successful moves or switch to counter expected counters, I'll choose rock to beat scissors. The risk is only -3 if they choose paper, but the upside is +1 if they repeat scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost 3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: -2 points\n\n2. Opponent's move sequence analysis:\n   - scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n   - Recent moves: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (they switched from double scissors to rock)\n\n3. Updated opponent's move frequency (10 rounds):\n   - Scissors: 5 times (rounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9)\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 2, 4, 5, 10)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 7)\n\n4. Key observations:\n   - They just played rock after two scissors in a row\n   - Rock frequency is catching up to scissors\n   - Paper remains their least used move (only 1/10 times)\n\n5. Strategic thinking for round 11:\n   - They might continue with rock (creating a pattern break from scissors dominance)\n   - They might return to scissors (their historical favorite)\n   - They might surprise with paper (their rarest move)\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - If I play paper and they play rock: I win +3 points (best case scenario)\n   - If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play scissors and they play paper: I win +1 point\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors: I win +1 point\n\n7. Given that I'm at -2 points and need a good recovery, and considering they rarely use paper (1/10), I'll take the calculated risk for the +3 reward by playing paper against their possible rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Wait, let me check the math on round 11:\n   - According to the rules: paper beats scissors (+1 to paper player)\n   - I won 1 point, bringing my total from -2 to -1 points\n\n3. Opponent's recent behavior:\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: scissors (back to scissors after rock)\n   - They seem to alternate or return to scissors frequently\n\n4. Updated opponent's move frequency (11 rounds):\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11) - Clear favorite!\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 2, 4, 5, 10)\n   - Paper: 1 time (round 7)\n\n5. Strong pattern recognition:\n   - Scissors is overwhelmingly their preferred move (6/11 times = 55%)\n   - They just returned to scissors after trying rock\n   - Paper remains extremely rare (only 1/11 times)\n\n6. Strategic decision for round 12:\n   - Given their strong scissors preference and recent return to scissors\n   - If they play scissors again: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - This would bring me to 0 points (breaking even)\n   - Rock is the safest counter to their most likely move\n\n7. The data strongly suggests they will play scissors again, so I'll counter with rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Updated game history:\n   - Rounds 1-11: (previous history)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total score: -1 points\n\n2. Opponent's recent move pattern:\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: scissors\n   - Round 12: rock\n   - They're now alternating: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3.

Strategic decision for round 13:\n   - If they continue alternating (rock \u2192 scissors): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If they break the pattern and play rock again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they surprise with paper: I lose (-3 points) - but paper is very rare for them\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: +1 if they play scissors (likely), 0 if rock, -3 if paper (very unlikely)\n   - The alternating pattern and their scissors preference both point to scissors next\n   - This could finally get me to 0 points (break even)\n\n7.

Verifying round 13 result:\n   - I played rock, opponent played scissors\n   - According to the rules: scissors beats rock (+1 to scissors player, -1 to rock player)\n   - So I should lose 1 point, but the feedback says I lost, which is correct\n   - My score goes from -1 to -2 points\n\n2.

Opponent's recent pattern confirmation:\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: scissors  \n   - Round 12: rock\n   - Round 13: scissors\n   - The alternating pattern is holding: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4.

Decision logic:\n   - The alternating pattern has been consistent for 4 rounds\n   - Paper vs rock gives the maximum reward (+3)\n   - I need a big win to recover from -2 points\n   - Risk: if they break pattern with scissors, I lose 1 point\n\n7.
