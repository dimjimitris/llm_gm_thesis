This isn't standard Rock-Paper-Scissors - the points are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nThe key insight is that winning with Rock gives 3 points (the highest reward), while winning with Paper or Scissors only gives 1 point. However, losing to Rock also costs 3 points (the highest penalty). This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), we need to consider common first-move tendencies. Research shows that beginners often:\n1. Choose Rock first (most common - about 35-40% of the time) due to its aggressive connotation\n2. Choose Paper second most often (about 30-35%)\n3. Choose Scissors least often (about 25-30%) as it feels weakest\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given the asymmetric payoffs, let's consider our options:\n- If we play Paper and they play Rock: We lose 3 points (worst case)\n- If we play Paper and they play Scissors: We win 1 point\n- If we play Rock and they play Paper: We win 3 points (best case)\n- If we play Scissors and they play Rock: We win 1 point\n\nThe expected value calculation suggests that if the opponent is likely to play Rock (which Psychology Expert suggests), then playing Scissors gives us +1 points, while playing Paper gives us -3 points.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with the Game Theory Expert's analysis. Given that fresh players tend to favor Rock, and considering the high penalty for losing to Rock with Paper, Scissors seems like the safest and most rewarding choice for this first round.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Based on our analysis:\n1. Fresh players commonly choose Rock first\n2. Playing Scissors against Rock wins us 1 point\n3. Playing Paper against Rock loses us 3 points (high risk)\n4. The risk-reward favors Scissors as our opening move\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors - it's the optimal choice against a likely Rock play from a fresh opponent, giving us a positive expected value while avoiding the high penalty risk.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The opponent played Paper, not Rock as we predicted. This tells us something important:\n- Our opponent beat us with Paper vs our Scissors (-1 points for us)\n- The opponent might not be following typical \"fresh player\" patterns\n- We need to reassess our strategy\n\nPsychology Expert: This is valuable information. The opponent chose Paper on their first move, which is less common for truly fresh players. This could mean:\n1. They're not as \"fresh\" as indicated, or\n2. They're thinking more strategically, or  \n3. They might have some knowledge of common first-move tendencies and chose Paper to counter the expected Rock\n\nNow for round 2, we need to consider: Will they stick with Paper (since it worked), switch to exploit what they think we'll do, or follow some other pattern?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's think about their possible reasoning:\n- If they think we'll stick with Scissors (since some players repeat), they might play Rock to get the big +3 points\n- If they think we'll switch to counter their Paper, they might expect us to play Rock, so they'd play Paper again\n- If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might switch to Scissors\n\nGiven the high reward for winning with Rock (+3), and the fact that they showed strategic thinking in round 1, there's a reasonable chance they'll try Rock this round.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. After winning with Paper, they might feel confident and go for the high-value Rock play, expecting us to either repeat Scissors or switch to Rock (which Paper would beat). Playing Scissors again could be our best move - it beats Rock for +1 points and only loses -1 to Paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Our analysis suggests:\n1. Opponent showed strategic thinking by choosing Paper first\n2. They might go for Rock this round to get the +3 point bonus\n3. Scissors beats Rock and gives us +1, while the downside against Paper is only -1\n4. The risk-reward still favors Scissors\n\n**Continue collaboration!**\n\nGame Theory Expert: Wait, let me reconsider. If they're strategic, they might anticipate that we'd think they'd go for Rock after their Paper win. They could play Paper again to counter our potential Rock choice, or even Scissors to tie if they think we'll repeat.\n\nPsychology Expert: You raise a good point. But given the limited information (only one round), and the fact that Rock offers the highest reward, I still think there's a good probability they'll try Rock. Scissors remains our best expected value play.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with maintaining our Scissors strategy. It's the best counter to a likely Rock play, and even if wrong, the penalty is manageable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors again - it's our best bet against a potential Rock play from a strategic opponent going for the high-value win.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Now we have valuable data:\n- Round 1: They played Paper\n- Round 2: They played Rock\n- Current score: We're at 0 points total (-1 + 1)\n\nThis suggests they might be cycling through moves or trying to be unpredictable. The next logical move in a cycle would be Scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: Great analysis! The opponent showed a Paper \u2192 Rock pattern. If they're following a simple rotation (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors), then Scissors is next. However, they might also be thinking:\n- \"I just lost with Rock, maybe I should try Paper again since it worked in round 1\"\n- \"They played Scissors twice, maybe they'll switch\"\n- Or they could indeed continue with Scissors to complete a cycle\n\nIf they play Scissors next, it's a tie (0 points). But we need to consider what beats Scissors - that's Rock, which gives us the big +3 points!\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly! This is a critical decision point. Here's the analysis:\n- If they play Scissors (completing the cycle): Rock gives us +3 points (best case)\n- If they play Paper (repeating their winning move): Rock loses us -3 points (worst case)\n- If they play Rock (repeating their last move): Rock ties for 0 points\n\nThe question is: what's more likely - Scissors (cycle completion) or Paper (returning to their winning move)?\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that they lost with Rock after winning with Paper, they might be more inclined to either:\n1. Complete the pattern with Scissors, or\n2. Return to Paper since it worked before\n\nHowever, the psychology of \"I just lost, let me try something different\" often leads to the next move in sequence, which would be Scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think we should go for Rock. Here's why:\n- High probability they'll play Scissors (pattern completion)\n- Rock vs Scissors = +3 points (maximum reward)\n- Even if we're wrong and they play Rock, it's just a tie\n- The only bad outcome is if they return to Paper (-3 points)\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The potential +3 reward outweighs the risk, especially since pattern completion is psychologically appealing after a Paper \u2192 Rock sequence.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Our analysis strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next, either due to pattern completion or trying something new after losing with Rock. Playing Rock gives us the maximum reward opportunity.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock - high probability opponent will play Scissors to complete the pattern, giving us the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

That doesn't match the rules we were given:\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n\nIf we played Rock and they played Paper, we should have won and gotten +3 points. That matches what happened! So our Rock beat their Paper for +3. Our total score is now +4 points (0 + 1 + 3).\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting data pattern emerging:\n- Round 1: They played Paper (we played Scissors, lost -1)\n- Round 2: They played Rock (we played Scissors, won +1) \n- Round 3: They played Paper (we played Rock, won +3)\n\nSo their pattern is: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. This suggests they might be alternating between Paper and Rock, or they returned to Paper after the Rock failed.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they're alternating Paper/Rock, then Rock would be next. But we also need to consider they might be adapting to our moves:\n- They've seen us play Scissors twice, then Rock once\n- They might expect us to stick with Rock (since it just won big), so they could play Paper again\n- Or they might expect us to switch back to Scissors\n\nThe pattern Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 ? could continue as Rock, or they might try Scissors for the first time.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with Paper (giving us +3), they're likely feeling the sting of that big loss. They might:\n1. Try Rock to get revenge and the big +3 points themselves\n2. Switch to Scissors (which they haven't tried yet)\n3. Stick with Paper if they think we'll switch away from Rock\n\nGiven they haven't played Scissors yet in 3 rounds, and Rock just cost them -3 points, Scissors seems increasingly likely.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. If they play Scissors, our best response is Rock for +3 points. Even if they play Rock (alternating pattern), we tie. The only bad outcome is if they repeat Paper, costing us -3.\n\nBut the psychology suggests Scissors is most likely - they need to try their unused move, especially after taking a big loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Analysis summary:\n- They've used Paper twice, Rock once, Scissors never\n- Just took a -3 point loss, likely want to try something different  \n- Scissors is their unused move and psychologically appealing\n- Rock beats Scissors for +3 points maximum reward\n- Low risk since even Rock vs Rock is just a tie\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock again - opponent most likely to try Scissors (their unused move) after the big loss, giving us another +3 point win.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Our total score is now +3 points (4 - 1).\n\nLet me map out what's happened:\n- Round 1: Us Scissors vs Their Paper = We lost -1\n- Round 2: Us Scissors vs Their Rock = We won +1  \n- Round 3: Us Rock vs Their Paper = We won +3\n- Round 4: Us Rock vs Their Scissors = We lost -1\n\nPsychology Expert: Very interesting pattern emerging from the opponent:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\nThey've now used all three moves! This could indicate:\n1. They're cycling through all options systematically\n2. They're adapting based on our moves\n3. They're trying to be unpredictable\n\nThey just won with Scissors after we played Rock twice in a row. They might think we'll stick with Rock again, or they might expect us to switch.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their pattern more carefully:\n- They started with Paper (beat our Scissors)\n- Switched to Rock (lost to our Scissors)  \n- Back to Paper (lost to our Rock)\n- Then Scissors (beat our Rock)\n\nIf there's a pattern, it's not simply cyclical. They seem to be adapting. After losing to our Rock with Paper, they switched to Scissors which beats Rock. They might be learning from our moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! They're showing adaptive behavior. They just succeeded with Scissors against our Rock. Now they might:\n1. Stick with Scissors (since it just worked)\n2. Expect us to switch from Rock to Paper (to beat Scissors), so they'd play Rock\n3. Try to be completely unpredictable\n\nIf they think we'll switch to Paper to counter their Scissors, they'd want to play Rock for the big +3 points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a key decision point. If they expect us to play Paper (to beat their potential Scissors repeat), they'd play Rock for +3. In that case, we should play Scissors to beat their Rock for +1.\n\nBut if they stick with Scissors, then Paper would beat it for +1.\n\nGiven their adaptive behavior, I lean toward them playing Rock (expecting us to switch to Paper). So Scissors would be our best move.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. They've shown strategic thinking and adaptation. After winning with Scissors, they're likely anticipating our counter-move to Paper, so they'd go for Rock to get the big reward. Scissors beats Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Our analysis suggests:\n- Opponent is adaptive and strategic\n- They likely expect us to play Paper to counter their successful Scissors\n- They'd counter our expected Paper with Rock for +3 points\n- We should play Scissors to beat their likely Rock for +1 points\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors - opponent likely expects us to play Paper and will counter with Rock for the big points, so Scissors beats their expected Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Look at their sequence:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nThey seem to be alternating between different strategies. After Paper-Rock-Paper, they tried Scissors, and now they're back to Rock. There might be a longer pattern emerging, or they could be getting into Rock/Scissors alternation since Paper hasn't worked well for them lately (lost twice with it).\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's analyze their decision-making:\n- Paper worked once (round 1), failed once (round 3) \n- Rock worked once (round 2), failed twice (rounds 4, 5)\n- Scissors worked once (round 4)\n\nRock has actually failed them more recently (2 losses in last 2 attempts). They might switch away from Rock. The question is: to Paper or Scissors?\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with Rock twice in a row (rounds 4 and 5), they're probably feeling frustrated with Rock despite it giving the biggest reward when it wins. They might:\n1. Try Paper again (their most successful move early on)\n2. Try Scissors again (it worked in round 4)\n3. Stick with Rock hoping for the big +3 payoff\n\nGiven the recent Rock failures, I think they'll switch. Between Paper and Scissors, Paper might feel \"safer\" since Scissors only just worked once.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Paper, we want Rock for +3 points. If they play Scissors, we want Paper for +1 point. If they stick with Rock despite recent losses, we want Scissors for +1 point.\n\nI think Paper is most likely (returning to their early success after Rock disappointment). So Rock would be our optimal play for the maximum +3 reward.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychology of \"go back to what worked before when current strategy fails\" suggests Paper. And we haven't played Rock in two rounds, so they might not expect it.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Analysis summary:\n- They've lost with Rock twice in a row\n- Paper was their early successful move\n- Likely to return to Paper after Rock frustration\n- Rock beats Paper for maximum +3 points\n- We haven't used Rock recently, so it might be unexpected to them\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock - opponent likely to return to Paper after consecutive Rock failures, giving us the maximum +3 point reward.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me update our tracking:\n\n- Round 1: Us Scissors vs Their Paper = We lost -1\n- Round 2: Us Scissors vs Their Rock = We won +1  \n- Round 3: Us Rock vs Their Paper = We won +3\n- Round 4: Us Rock vs Their Scissors = We lost -1\n- Round 5: Us Scissors vs Their Rock = We won +1\n- Round 6: Us Rock vs Their Paper = We won +3\n- Round 7: Us Paper vs Their Scissors = We won +1\n- Round 8: Us Scissors vs Their Rock = We won +1\n\nCurrent score: +9 points total\n\nTheir complete pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nPsychology Expert: This is extraordinary! Look at their pattern:\nPaper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n\nI'm now seeing a clearer structure:\n- They seem to be following some kind of modified cycle\n- Paper appears at positions 1, 3, 6\n- Rock appears at positions 2, 5, 8\n- Scissors appears at positions 4, 7\n\nIf there's a pattern, what comes next at position 9? Looking at the sequence, it might be continuing the Paper-Rock-Scissors cycle, but with their own variation.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let's look at this more systematically. If I group their moves:\n- Group 1: Paper, Rock, Paper (rounds 1-3)\n- Group 2: Scissors, Rock, Paper (rounds 4-6)  \n- Group 3: Scissors, Rock, ? (rounds 7-9)\n\nIn each group of 3, they seem to end with Paper (rounds 3, 6). So round 9 might be Paper to complete the pattern!\n\nPsychology Expert: That's a brilliant observation! They might be following a 3-round cycle pattern where each group ends with Paper. They've also just lost with Rock again (round 8), so they might want to switch away from Rock.\n\nIf they play Paper (to complete the pattern), we'd want Rock for the maximum +3 points. This could be a big scoring opportunity!\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with this analysis. The pattern strongly suggests Paper for round 9. Even from a psychological standpoint, after losing with Rock again, returning to Paper (which at least won them round 1) makes sense.\n\nRock beats Paper for +3 points - this could be another maximum reward round for us.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Our pattern analysis shows:\n- Clear 3-round groupings, each ending with Paper\n- Round 9 should be Paper to complete the third group\n- They just lost with Rock, likely to switch\n- Rock beats Paper for maximum +3 points\n- We've been reading them perfectly - trust the pattern\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock - the 3-round pattern analysis strongly indicates Paper next, giving us the maximum +3 point reward with Rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Let me verify our 3-round grouping theory:\n- Group 1: Paper, Rock, Paper (rounds 1-3) \u2713\n- Group 2: Scissors, Rock, Paper (rounds 4-6) \u2713  \n- Group 3: Scissors, Rock, Paper (rounds 7-9) \u2713\n\nThe pattern is holding perfectly! Each group of 3 rounds follows the same structure:\n- Round X: Variable (Paper or Scissors)\n- Round X+1: Rock  \n- Round X+2: Paper\n\nSo for round 10, we're starting Group 4. Based on the pattern:\n- Group 1 started with Paper\n- Group 2 started with Scissors  \n- Group 3 started with Scissors\n\nWhat will Group 4 start with?\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at the first move of each group:\n- Group 1: Paper\n- Group 2: Scissors\n- Group 3: Scissors\n- Group 4: ?\n\nIt could be:\n1. Scissors again (continuing the trend)\n2. Rock (trying the third option)\n3. Paper (returning to the beginning)\n\nGiven that Groups 2 and 3 both started with Scissors, they might either continue with Scissors or try something new. Rock seems like the logical next choice since they haven't started a group with Rock yet.\n\nPsychology Expert: I think Rock is most likely for round 10. They've started two consecutive groups with Scissors, so variety suggests trying Rock. Plus, Rock gives them the chance for the big +3 points if it works.\n\nIf they play Rock, we want Scissors for +1 point.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Pattern analysis for round 10 (start of Group 4):\n- Groups 2 and 3 both started with Scissors\n- They haven't started a group with Rock yet\n- Rock is the logical next choice for variety\n- Scissors beats Rock for +1 point\n- The pattern has been incredibly reliable - continue following it\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors - Group 4 likely starts with Rock (the unused group-starter), and Scissors beats Rock for +1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They're likely adapting to our pattern recognition.\n\nRecent sequence: Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper\nWhat comes after two Papers? They might:\n1. Continue with Paper (three in a row)\n2. Switch to Rock (haven't used it since round 8)\n3. Switch to Scissors\n\nPsychology Expert: After playing Paper twice and getting one loss and one tie, they might want to try something different. Rock hasn't appeared since round 8 - they've been avoiding it after it kept losing. But maybe they'll try it again now.\n\nAlternatively, they might go to Scissors to break the Paper pattern.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Rock (returning to it after avoiding it), we want Scissors for +1. If they play Scissors (breaking the Paper pattern), we want Paper for +1. If they stick with Paper again, we want Rock for +3.\n\nGiven they just tied with Paper and might want a different result, I lean toward them trying Rock or Scissors. Since they haven't used Rock in a while, Rock seems more likely.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Their pattern recognition suggests they're trying to be unpredictable now. After two Papers, they'll likely switch to either Rock or Scissors. Rock seems more probable since they haven't used it since round 8.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n[move] (They might try Rock after avoiding it since round 8) scissors\n"

Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock, losing -1, -3, -1, -1 respectively. They're now down -6 points in just four rounds.

They might:\n1. Panic and become truly random\n2. Go back to what worked earliest (Paper won in round 1)\n3. Avoid Rock since it just failed again\n4. Try Scissors since it's been the \"least recent\" failure\n\nPsychology Expert: After four straight losses, they're in psychological freefall. Rock just failed again, so they'll probably avoid it. Paper has that traumatic -3 memory. Scissors might seem like the \"freshest\" option since it was three rounds ago (round 16) compared to Rock which just failed.\n\nBut honestly, at this point they might be making desperate, emotional choices rather than logical ones.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their current mental state, I think Scissors is most likely.

Both Paper and Rock just gave them ties, so they might stick with one of these \"working\" moves.\n\nBetween Paper and Rock, Rock was more recent and they might want to repeat immediate success. If they play Rock again, we want Scissors for +1.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think there's also a chance they try Scissors to \"complete the set\" - they've now had success with Paper (tie) and Rock (tie), so maybe Scissors will work too. But Rock repetition seems more likely given recency bias.\n\nIf Rock: we play Scissors for +1\nIf Scissors: we play Paper for +1\n\nI lean toward Rock repetition after the immediate success.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After two consecutive ties feeling like victories, they might stick with Rock since it just worked.

Their recent sequence:\n- Round 17: Rock (lost -1)\n- Round 18: Paper (tie 0)\n- Round 19: Rock (tie 0)  \n- Round 20: Paper (won +1)\n\nSo: Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n\nThey're alternating Paper and Rock, and it's working! Two ties followed by their first win in many rounds. They must be feeling great - they've finally figured out a strategy that's working.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Exactly!

If they continue this pattern, round 21 should be Rock (alternating from Paper).\n\nPsychology Expert: After finally winning with Paper, and having success with the Paper/Rock alternation, they'll almost certainly continue this pattern. The alternation has been their most successful strategy recently.\n\nIf they play Rock in round 21 (continuing the alternation), we want Scissors for +1 point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I completely agree. The Paper/Rock alternation is their first successful strategy in many rounds.

They're probably thinking they've cracked the code with Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! After their long losing streak, finding a move that wins twice in a row feels like discovering gold. They're likely to stick with Paper as long as it keeps working.\n\nThe psychology of \"don't fix what isn't broken\" strongly suggests they'll play Paper again in round 22.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I completely agree. Two consecutive wins with Paper after their previous struggles means they'll almost certainly stick with it.\n\nIf they play Paper again, we want Rock for +3 points.

They did stick with Paper for the third time.

This is a huge psychological shift - their \"golden move\" just betrayed them with the maximum penalty.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a critical moment! Their confidence in Paper has been shattered. After thinking they found their winning formula, Paper just delivered the worst possible result (-3 points).\n\nThis is similar to what happened before - when a move delivers the maximum penalty, they tend to avoid it. We've seen this pattern with Rock earlier, and now Paper has the -3 stigma.\n\nPsychology Expert: Absolutely! After the trauma of losing -3 with Paper (their recent \"winning move\"), they'll want to get as far away from Paper as possible. They'll likely switch to either Rock or Scissors.\n\nBetween the two, Rock hasn't been tried recently in their Paper streak, while Scissors is the remaining option. Given they were alternating Paper/Rock before the Paper streak, they might return to Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they play Rock, we want Scissors for +1. If they play Scissors, we want Paper for +1.\n\nI think Rock is more likely - it was part of their successful alternation pattern before they got fixated on Paper. After Paper's betrayal, Rock might feel like returning to something that worked before.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After Paper's devastating -3 betrayal of their \"winning formula,\" they'll abandon it completely.

They went back to Scissors instead of sticking with their winning Rock.\n\nMy opponent's sequence: Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Scissors\n\nThey've now played:\n- Scissors: 13 times\n- Rock: 7 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n\nRecent pattern: Rock, Scissors - after getting the big win with Rock, they went back to their favorite Scissors.\n\nSince we just tied on Scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with Scissors (their clear preference - 13 out of 23 times)\n2. Switch to Rock (their second most played move)\n3. Try Paper\n\nGiven their strong preference for Scissors and the fact that it's been very successful for them overall, there's a good chance they'll stick with it. I should play Paper to counter Scissors.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that when they get a big Rock win, they often return to Scissors afterward. I'll go with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
