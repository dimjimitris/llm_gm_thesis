    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. I notice that rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses.\n\n3. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" with no prior information about their tendencies, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value.\n\n4. Rock is high-risk, high-reward. If the opponent randomly chooses, rock has a 1/3 chance of winning big (+3), 1/3 chance of losing big (-3), and 1/3 chance of tying (0).\n\n5. However, many new players tend to choose rock as their first move intuitively, as it's often the first option people think of in rock-paper-scissors.\n\n6. If I assume the opponent might choose rock, then paper would be my best counter, giving me +3 points.\n\n7. Even if they don't choose rock, paper only loses badly to scissors (which seems less likely as a first choice for a new player).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to counter the possibility of the opponent choosing rock, which would give me the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me information about the opponent - they also chose paper in the first round, which suggests they might have had similar reasoning to mine (expecting rock from a new player).\n\n3. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it worked reasonably well\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll stick with paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter paper\n\n4. Looking at the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they choose paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they choose rock: I need scissors to win (+1 point)\n   - If they choose scissors: I need rock to win (+3 points)\n\n5. Since rock gives me the highest reward (+3) if I win, and the opponent showed they're willing to play paper, there's a reasonable chance they might stick with paper or go to scissors (which loses to rock).\n\n6. The risk is that they choose rock, which would cost me -3 points, but given they chose paper first (not rock), they might be less likely to go to rock now.\n\n7. I'll take the calculated risk for the higher payoff.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially gain +3 points if they choose paper again or switch to scissors.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 4 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 7, 9)\n   - Rock: 2 times (rounds 5, 6)\n\n4. They just chose scissors for the second time in a row (rounds 7 and 9), and it was scissors in both cases where we tied.\n\n5. Looking at their recent pattern: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They seem to be alternating more and have now used scissors twice in the last three rounds.\n\n6. If they continue with scissors, we'd tie again (0 points).\n   If they switch to rock, scissors would beat rock (+1 point for me).\n   If they switch to paper, paper would beat scissors (-1 point for me).\n\n7. Since they just used scissors twice recently and seem to be varying their play, they might switch to either rock or paper.\n\n8. Between rock and paper:\n   - Rock hasn't been used since round 6 (3 rounds ago)\n   - Paper was used in round 8 (1 round ago)\n   - They might return to rock since it's been absent longer\n\n9. If they choose rock, I need scissors to win (+1 point).\n   If they choose paper, I need rock to win (+3 points).\n\n10. The high reward for beating paper (+3) is tempting, but paper was used more recently. Rock hasn't appeared in 3 rounds and might be \"due\" in their rotation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, betting they'll switch to rock after using scissors twice recently.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now chosen scissors THREE times in a row (rounds 7, 9, 10) with ties in rounds 7, 9, and 10.\n\n5. This is a clear pattern emerging - they seem to be stuck on scissors or deliberately choosing it repeatedly.\n\n6. If they continue with scissors again, we'll tie once more (0 points).\n\n7. However, this strong scissors pattern suggests they might either:\n   - Continue the scissors streak\n   - Break it by switching to rock or paper\n\n8. If I assume they'll break the pattern:\n   - Rock beats scissors, so if they expect me to counter scissors with rock, they might choose paper\n   - But rock hasn't been used in 4 rounds now (since round 6)\n\n9. Given their heavy recent reliance on scissors (3 in a row), I should probably assume they'll either continue it or switch to counter what they think I'll do.\n\n10. If they think I'll choose rock to beat their scissors pattern, they'd choose paper to beat my rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper.\n\n11. But if they simply continue the scissors pattern, I should choose rock to beat scissors and finally win some points.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to break this tie pattern and beat their scissors streak, aiming for +1 point.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Interesting development: They broke their scissors streak (3 in a row) by switching to paper, which lost to my rock.\n\n5. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They anticipated I might counter their scissors pattern with rock, so they switched to paper to beat rock. However, I was correct in choosing rock.\n\n6. Now they might think:\n   - I might stick with rock since it just won big (+3)\n   - Or I might think they'll go back to scissors after the paper didn't work\n   - Or they might expect me to switch strategies entirely\n\n7. Looking at their overall preferences:\n   - Paper is their most frequent choice (5/11 rounds)\n   - They just used paper and it failed\n   - Rock hasn't been used in 5 rounds (since round 6)\n\n8. If they think I'll stick with rock (since it just won), they might choose paper again to beat rock.\n   If they think I'll switch to scissors (to beat their expected paper), they might choose rock.\n   If they go back to their scissors pattern, I'd need rock again.\n\n9. Given that they just tried paper to counter my expected rock and it backfired, they might switch to rock (which hasn't appeared in a while) or go back to scissors.\n\n10. The safe play might be scissors - it beats rock (+1) and only loses to paper (-1), with no high-risk/high-reward scenario.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, betting they'll either return to rock (which hasn't been used recently) or continue avoiding paper after it just failed.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now chosen paper twice in a row (rounds 11 and 12). Paper is clearly their dominant strategy (6/12 rounds = 50%).\n\n5. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper. They broke the scissors streak with paper and are now continuing with paper.\n\n6. They seem to have realized that paper is working well for them:\n   - Round 11: paper beat my rock (but I won due to rule confusion on my part - actually they lost)\n   - Round 12: paper beat my scissors\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules:\n- \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\nSo in round 11, my rock beat their paper, giving me +3 points.\n- \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\nSo in round 12, their paper beat my scissors, giving them +1 and me -1.\n\n7. So they lost big in round 11 (-3) but won small in round 12 (+1). Despite this, they stuck with paper.\n\n8. If they continue with paper (their most frequent choice), I need rock to beat it and get +3 points.\n\n9. However, they might think I'll choose rock to counter their paper pattern, so they could switch to scissors to beat rock.\n\n10. Looking at what hasn't been used recently:\n    - Rock hasn't appeared since round 6 (6 rounds ago)\n    - They might return to rock, or they might stick with their successful paper strategy\n\n11.

Looking at their overall pattern, they seem to use paper and scissors almost equally (6 vs 5 times), with rock being rare.\n\n8. Their recent choices suggest they're being adaptive rather than following a fixed pattern. They might be trying to stay one step ahead of my predictions.\n\n9. If they think I'll now expect scissors and choose rock, they might go to paper.\n   If they think I'll expect them to switch back to paper and choose scissors, they might go to rock (which they haven't used in 7 rounds).\n\n10.

Paper is now clearly their dominant strategy (7/15 rounds = 47%), and they've used it successfully against me multiple times.\n\n7. They seem to have a good read on my strategy. They might expect that I'll now choose rock to counter their paper preference.\n\n8. If they expect me to choose rock, they would choose scissors to beat it.\n\n9. Looking at their pattern, they just used: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If they're cycling, they might go back to scissors next.\n\n10. However, they could also stick with paper since it just worked and is their most successful move.\n\n11.

Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 15)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16)\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 5, 6, 14)\n\n4. Their recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They seem to be alternating between paper and scissors recently, with occasional rock.\n\n5. This is becoming very clear - my opponent is reading my strategy extremely well:\n   - When I expected paper and chose rock, they chose scissors\n   - When I expected scissors and chose rock, they chose scissors\n   - They're successfully counter-playing my moves\n\n6. Looking at the last few rounds: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. If there's a cycling pattern, paper might be next.\n\n7. But more importantly, I need to recognize that they're adapting to my strategy. They seem to anticipate what I'll choose based on what they just played.\n\n8. Since they just used scissors and beat my rock, they might expect me to:\n   - Choose paper to beat scissors\n   - Or choose rock again thinking they'll switch\n\n9. If they expect me to choose paper, they would choose scissors to beat it.\n   If they expect me to choose rock, they would choose scissors to beat it.\n   \n10. Actually, scissors seems to be their go-to counter-move recently - they've used it successfully in rounds 13 and 16 against my rock.\n\n11. If they continue with scissors, I need rock to beat it (+1 point).\n    If they switch to paper, I need rock to beat it (+3 points).\n    If they switch to rock, rock would tie (0 points).\n\n12. But wait - they just successfully used scissors twice against my rock. They might stick with what's working, or they might expect me to finally learn and choose paper to beat scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat their likely scissors choice, breaking away from the rock strategy that they've been successfully countering.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16)\n   - Rock: 3 times (rounds 5, 6, 14)\n\n4. Their recent pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They switched from scissors (which had been working well against my rock) back to paper.\n\n5. Interesting observation: We just both chose paper. This is the third time we've tied with the same move (rounds 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, and now 17).\n\n6. Paper is now even more dominant in their strategy (8/17 rounds = 47%), and they just used it again.\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After round 1 (both paper): they chose scissors\n   - After round 3 (both paper): they chose paper again\n   - After round 7 (both scissors): they chose paper\n   - After round 9 (both scissors): they chose scissors again\n   - After round 10 (both scissors): they chose paper\n\n8. After ties, they seem to either repeat the same move or switch to paper (their preferred choice).\n\n9. Since we just tied with paper, they might:\n   - Stick with paper (their most frequent choice)\n   - Switch to scissors (like they did after the first paper tie)\n   - Switch to rock (least likely given low frequency)\n\n10. If they stick with paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n    If they switch to scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n    If they switch to rock: scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n11. Scissors beats both paper and rock, only losing to scissors. Given their strong paper preference and the fact they just used paper, scissors seems like the safest choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice, or to beat rock if they make an unexpected switch.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They just switched to rock after I correctly predicted they might use paper or rock and chose scissors.\n\n5. I've now won twice with scissors against their rock (rounds 14 and 18). They might start to expect scissors from me when they use rock.\n\n6. Looking at their overall behavior:\n   - Paper is still their most frequent choice (8/18 = 44%)\n   - They seem to be balancing their choices more now\n   - Rock usage has increased (4/18 = 22%)\n\n7. They just lost with rock, so they might:\n   - Switch back to their preferred paper\n   - Try scissors to counter my expected scissors\n   - Continue with rock\n\n8. Given that scissors just beat their rock, they might expect me to stick with scissors and choose rock to counter it. But rock just failed for them.\n\n9. If they switch back to paper (their historical preference), I need scissors to beat it (+1 point).\n   If they choose scissors to counter my expected scissors, we tie (0 points).\n   If they stick with rock, scissors beats it again (+1 point).\n\n10. However, I should consider that they might be learning my patterns too. I've chosen scissors successfully in rounds 14 and 18 against their rock. They might anticipate this and choose rock to beat my expected scissors.\n\nWait, that's wrong - rock doesn't beat scissors, scissors beats rock. Let me reconsider:\n\nIf they expect me to choose scissors (since it just worked), they would choose rock to... no, that doesn't work. They would choose paper to beat scissors.\n\n11. So if they think I'll stick with scissors, they'd choose paper to beat it.\n    This actually aligns with their preference for paper anyway.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely paper choice, aiming for the high-value +3 points.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. They went back to paper after rock failed, and I correctly predicted this with rock.\n\n5. I just won big (+3 points) with rock beating their paper. This is the third time I've won +3 points by beating their paper with rock (rounds 4, 11, and 19).\n\n6. Paper remains their most frequent choice (9/19 = 47%), and they just used it again despite losing with it multiple times to my rock.\n\n7. Now they might think:\n   - I'll stick with rock since it just won big\n   - Or they might expect me to think they'll switch away from paper\n\n8. If they expect me to use rock again, they would choose scissors to beat it.\n   If they think I'll switch strategies, they might go back to paper or try rock.\n\n9. Looking at their pattern after losing with paper to my rock:\n   - Round 4: lost with paper, then chose rock in round 5\n   - Round 11: lost with paper, then chose paper again in round 12\n   - Round 19: just lost with paper...\n\n10. After previous big losses with paper, they've either switched to rock or stuck with paper. Given that rock just failed for them in round 18, they might be less likely to choose rock.\n\n11. They might either:\n    - Stick with paper (their preference)\n    - Choose scissors to counter my expected rock\n\n12. If they choose scissors to counter rock, I need rock to beat scissors (+1 point).\n    If they stick with paper, I need rock to beat paper again (+3 points).\n    If they choose rock, we'd tie (0 points).\n\n13. The high reward for beating paper (+3) is tempting, but they might finally learn to counter my rock strategy with scissors.\n\n14. However, looking at their history, they seem quite committed to paper even when it loses. They might stick with it again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again, betting on their strong paper preference and aiming for another +3 point win.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their recent pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. They finally adapted! After I beat their paper with rock twice (rounds 11 and 19), they switched to scissors to counter my rock strategy.\n\n5. This is exactly what I was worried about - they learned from my successful rock-beats-paper pattern and countered it with scissors.\n\n6. They've now used scissors successfully against my rock in rounds 2, 13, 16, and 20. This seems to be their go-to counter when they expect rock from me.\n\n7. Now they might think:\n   - I'll switch away from rock since it just lost\n   - Or I'll stick with rock thinking they won't use scissors again\n   - Or I'll choose paper to beat their expected scissors\n\n8. If they expect me to choose paper to beat scissors, they would choose scissors to beat paper.\n   If they expect me to stick with rock, they would choose scissors again to beat rock.\n   If they think I'll switch to scissors, they would choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n9. Looking at their recent behavior, they seem to be reading my strategy well. They successfully predicted I'd use rock again and countered with scissors.\n\n10. They might expect me to now choose paper to beat their scissors, so they could stick with scissors or switch to rock.\n\n11. Given that scissors just worked for them and they've used it successfully against my rock multiple times, they might stick with it.\n\n12. If they stick with scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n    If they switch to paper: rock beats paper (+3 points)\n    If they switch to rock: we tie (0 points)\n\n13. But wait - they just successfully used scissors against my rock. They might expect me to avoid rock now and choose paper. If so, they'd use scissors to beat paper.\n\n14. This is getting complex, but I think they're more likely to either stick with scissors (since it worked) or expect me to choose paper (to beat scissors) and counter with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely scissors choice, even though they just beat my rock with scissors. Sometimes the best counter to being countered is to stick with the original strategy.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: rock\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: paper\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: scissors\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: paper\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n\n3. Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 9 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19)\n   - Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 20)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 5, 6, 14, 18, 21)\n\n4. Their recent pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. Interesting - they just switched to rock after using scissors successfully against my rock.\n\n5. We just tied with both choosing rock. This is now the 6th tie in the game (rounds 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 17, 21).\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After round 1 (both paper): chose scissors\n   - After round 3 (both paper): chose paper\n   - After round 7 (both scissors): chose paper  \n   - After round 9 (both scissors): chose scissors\n   - After round 10 (both scissors): chose paper\n   - After round 17 (both paper): chose rock\n\n7. After ties, they seem to have mixed behavior - sometimes repeating, sometimes switching, often going to paper.\n\n8. They just chose rock (which tied), and rock is their least frequent choice historically. They might:\n   - Switch back to paper (their most frequent choice)\n   - Switch to scissors (which has been working well against my rock)\n   - Continue with rock\n\n9. Given that they just used rock and it tied, and considering their overall preference for paper, they might switch back to paper.\n\n10. But they also might think I'll expect paper and choose scissors to counter it.\n\n11. Looking at the current balance:\n    - Paper: 9/21 = 43%\n    - Scissors: 7/21 = 33% \n    - Rock: 5/21 = 24%\n\n12. They're still favoring paper overall, and after experimenting with rock, they might return to their comfort zone.\n\n13. If they choose paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n    If they choose scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n    If they choose rock: scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n14. Scissors beats both paper and rock, only losing to scissors. Given their mixed strategy but overall paper preference, scissors seems like a safe choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice or any rock they might continue with.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 9 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 20, 22)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 5, 6, 14, 18, 21)\n\n4. Their recent pattern: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They've now chosen scissors twice in their last three moves.\n\n5. We just tied with both choosing scissors. This is now the 7th tie in the game. The ties are becoming quite frequent.\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after ties with scissors specifically:\n   - After round 7 (both scissors): chose paper\n   - After round 9 (both scissors): chose scissors  \n   - After round 10 (both scissors): chose paper\n\n7. After scissors ties, they've alternated between paper and scissors, with a slight tendency toward paper (2 out of 3 times).\n\n8. Their overall frequencies are now much more balanced:\n   - Paper: 9/22 = 41%\n   - Scissors: 8/22 = 36%\n   - Rock: 5/22 = 23%\n\n9. They're using scissors almost as much as paper now, which is a shift from their earlier paper dominance.\n\n10. After this scissors tie, based on their pattern after scissors ties, they might choose paper (which they did 2/3 times before).\n\n11. If they choose paper: scissors beats paper (+1 point)\n    If they choose scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)  \n    If they choose rock: scissors beats rock (+1 point)\n\n12. Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. They seem to cycle through moves more now, and they just used scissors. Given their recent pattern and the fact that paper has worked well for them historically, they might switch to paper.\n\n13. But they could also stick with scissors since it just tied (no penalty) and has been working in their recent strategy.\n\n14. Looking at their last few moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. If there's a pattern, rock might be next, but rock is their least used move.\n\n15. I think paper is most likely given their historical preference and their tendency to choose paper after scissors ties.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors to beat their likely paper choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The rules state \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\" So their paper beat my scissors, meaning they won and I lost -1 points.\n\n2. My opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: rock\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: paper\n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: paper\n   - Round 12: paper\n   - Round 13: scissors\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: paper\n   - Round 16: scissors\n   - Round 17: paper\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: rock\n   - Round 22: scissors\n   - Round 23: paper\n\n3. Current frequencies:\n   - Paper: 10 times (rounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 23)\n   - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 20, 22)\n   - Rock: 5 times (rounds 5, 6, 14, 18, 21)\n\n4. Their recent pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper. They just successfully used paper against my scissors, exactly as I predicted they might do after the scissors tie.\n\n5. This confirms my analysis was correct - after scissors ties, they tend to choose paper (now 3 out of 4 times after scissors ties).\n\n6. Paper is back to being their most dominant choice (10/23 = 43%), and they just won with it.\n\n7. They might:\n   - Stick with paper since it just worked\n   - Switch to something else thinking I'll now counter paper\n\n8. If they stick with paper, I need rock to beat it (+3 points).\n   If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll use rock to beat paper), I need rock to beat scissors (+1 point).\n   If they switch to rock, I need scissors to beat rock (+1 point).\n\n9. Looking at their pattern after winning with paper:\n   - After round 1 (paper tie): chose scissors\n   - After round 4 (paper lost to rock): chose rock  \n   - After round 8 (paper beat scissors): chose scissors\n   - After round 12 (paper beat scissors): chose scissors\n   - After round 15 (paper beat scissors): chose scissors\n   - After round 17 (paper tie): chose rock\n   - After round 19 (paper lost to rock): chose scissors\n   - After round 23 (paper beat scissors): ?\n\n10. When paper successfully beats scissors, they often follow with scissors (3 out of 4 times in rounds 8, 12, 15).\n\n11. If they choose scissors, I need rock to beat it (+1 point).\n    If they stick with paper, I need rock to beat it (+3 points).\n\n12. Rock beats both their most likely choices (paper and scissors), only losing to scissors. But their pattern suggests scissors is more likely after a successful paper move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat their likely scissors choice (based on their pattern after successful paper moves) or to get the high reward if they stick with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"
