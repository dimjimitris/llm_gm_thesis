Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats Paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats Rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3 points) when it loses to Paper.\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely haven't developed a sophisticated strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose Rock frequently (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n   - May go with their first instinct\n   - Haven't yet learned to exploit the asymmetric payoffs\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors: I lose -1 point\n   - If I play Paper and opponent plays Paper: Tie, 0 points\n\n5. Strategic reasoning: Since Rock offers the highest reward but also highest risk, and fresh players tend to favor Rock, playing Paper gives me the best expected value against an inexperienced opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper to counter the likely Rock choice from a fresh player, aiming for the high-value +3 point win.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Review the updated situation:\n   - Round 18: Me Scissors, Opponent Scissors (tie, 0 points)\n   - Current total: -4 points\n   - This confirms the opponent is still mirroring when I don't try to break patterns\n\n2. Analyze the tie pattern:\n   - We've now had 8 ties out of 18 rounds (44.4%)\n   - Recent sequence: Scissors tie \u2192 Rock tie \u2192 Paper loss \u2192 Scissors tie\n   - The opponent seems to default to mirroring, but punishes my pattern-breaking attempts\n\n3. Consider the opponent's likely thinking:\n   - They just mirrored my Scissors successfully\n   - They might expect me to either continue with Scissors or switch\n   - If they think I'll stick with Scissors, they might mirror again (tie)\n   - If they think I'll switch, they might try to counter my expected switch\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Continue with Scissors: Likely another tie (0 points) - safe but not progressive\n   - Switch to Rock: Beats Scissors (+1) if they repeat, loses to Paper (-3) if they counter\n   - Switch to Paper: Beats Rock (+3) if they counter-switch, loses to Scissors (-1) if they repeat\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has been very good at predicting my switches and punishing them\n   - However, I'm -4 points behind and need to take some calculated risks\n   - Staying in tie mode won't help me catch up\n   - The opponent might expect me to continue the \"safe\" Scissors after it just worked\n   - If they mirror Scissors again, Rock would beat it for +1\n   - If they try to counter by switching to Rock, Paper would beat that for +3\n   - I think they're more likely to mirror than counter-switch right now\n   - Rock gives me the safest upside while avoiding the maximum penalty\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock to beat potential repeated Scissors, accepting moderate risk to try to gain ground.\n\n[move] (Need to take calculated risks to catch up from -4 points) rock\n"
