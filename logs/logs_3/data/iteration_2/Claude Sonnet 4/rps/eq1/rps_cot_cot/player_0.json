    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - someone who hasn't played before or has no established pattern.\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, psychological studies show that inexperienced players tend to favor rock slightly more often as their first move, as it's often the first option mentioned and feels \"stronger.\"\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to play rock, then paper would be the optimal counter-move, as paper beats rock.\n\n6. Even if my reasoning is wrong, there's no disadvantage - each move has equal expected value against a truly random opponent.\n\n7. Playing paper gives me the best chance to capitalize on the slight psychological bias toward rock while having no downside risk.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the most likely first move from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] paper"

This reveals important information: my opponent also chose paper, which suggests they might have similar strategic thinking to mine (countering an expected rock play).\n\n3. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in round 2, knowing that we both played paper in round 1.\n\n4. My opponent might think: \"We both played paper, so they might expect me to switch strategies. Maybe I should play rock or scissors.\"\n\n5. Alternatively, my opponent might think: \"Paper worked as a safe choice, I'll stick with it.\"\n\n6. There's also the possibility my opponent will try to counter what they think I'll do next.\n\n7. Given that we both showed similar strategic thinking in round 1 (both choosing paper), my opponent likely isn't just playing randomly.\n\n8. If my opponent thinks I might switch from paper to rock (to counter a potential scissors play from them), then they might choose paper again to beat my potential rock.\n\n9. However, if they think I'm thinking about their counter-thinking, they might choose scissors to beat my potential paper.\n\n10. To break this cycle of overthinking, I'll choose rock - it counters scissors (if they're trying to beat paper) and creates variety in my play pattern.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter scissors and diversify my strategy.\n\n[move] rock"

My opponent's sequence so far: paper \u2192 scissors\n   This shows they're switching moves between rounds, not sticking to one strategy.\n\n3.

If my opponent is rotating systematically, their sequence might be: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock (completing the cycle).\n\n5. Alternatively, they might try to counter what they think I'll play next. Since I won with rock, they might expect me to play rock again, so they could choose paper to beat rock.\n\n6. Or they might think I'll switch from rock (since it worked) to either paper or scissors.\n\n7. Given that my opponent switched from paper to scissors after the tie, they seem to be actively changing their strategy rather than being random.\n\n8. If they do play rock next (completing a rotation pattern), I should play paper to beat it.\n\n9. If they play paper (to counter an expected rock from me), I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n10. Between these two possibilities, I'll go with scissors, as it covers the scenario where they expect me to repeat my winning rock move and choose paper to counter it.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper, which they might choose to counter my previous winning rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

However, they might realize I could pick up on this pattern and decide to break it.\n\n5. Looking at it from their perspective: they just beat my scissors with rock. They might expect me to counter with paper (since paper beats rock), so they could play scissors to beat my expected paper.\n\n6. But I need to consider: are they actually following a deliberate pattern, or is this coincidental?\n\n7. The fact that they went through each move exactly once suggests intentionality rather than randomness.\n\n8. If they continue the pattern and play paper next, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n9.

My opponent might be adapting their strategy based on my moves or trying to be more unpredictable after I potentially caught onto their initial pattern.\n\n5.

This suggests either:\n   - They predicted I would play scissors (which I did)\n   - It's coincidental\n   - They're trying a different strategy now\n\n6.
