Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is my first move against a \"fresh player\" - meaning they likely haven't established any patterns yet.\n\n2. Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that many new players tend to choose rock as their first move due to its perceived \"strength\" or simplicity.\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to choose rock, then I should choose paper to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n\n6. Even if I'm wrong about this tendency, paper is just as valid as any other choice for the first move.\n\n7. This gives me the best chance to capitalize on common first-move psychology while maintaining equal odds if the opponent chooses randomly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to potentially counter the common tendency to choose rock on the first move.\n\n[move] paper"

Since we both chose paper, this suggests my opponent is thinking at least one level deep strategically, not just making random choices.\n\n4. Now I need to consider what they might do next. They know I chose paper in round 1.\n\n5. They might think: \"My opponent chose paper, so they were trying to beat rock. Maybe they'll stick with paper, so I should choose scissors.\"\n\n6. But they might also think I'll switch strategies entirely, making their prediction harder.\n\n7. Given that we both made the same strategic choice initially, I should assume they're thinking tactically. A common pattern after a tie is for players to switch to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (to beat the paper we both just played), I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n9.

Looking at the pattern of my losses:\n   - Round 7: My paper lost to their scissors\n   - Round 8: My rock lost to their paper  \n   - Round 9: My scissors lost to their rock\n\n5. This is exactly the losing cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, and my opponent played the perfect counter each time: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock.\n\n6. My opponent seems to be predicting not just my next move, but my strategic thinking process. They're staying one step ahead.\n\n7. I need to completely change my approach. Instead of trying to out-think them strategically, maybe I should:\n   - Stop overthinking and choose more randomly\n   - Or look for a completely different pattern they haven't anticipated\n\n8. Since they've been successfully counter-predicting me, maybe I should do something unexpected - like repeat the move I just lost with (scissors), which would be seemingly irrational.\n\n9. Or I could choose the move that would have beaten their last move (paper beats rock), assuming they won't expect me to do the \"obvious\" thing after being outplayed.\n\n10. Given that I'm clearly being out-strategized, I think my best bet is to be genuinely unpredictable. Paper is the move that would beat their last winning move (rock), and sometimes the obvious choice is the least expected.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, going with the straightforward counter instead of complex meta-thinking that hasn't been working.\n\n[move] paper"

Devastating pattern: I've now lost 4 rounds in a row. My opponent has completely figured out my thinking process.\n\n3. Looking at my losing streak specifically:\n   - Round 7: My paper \u2192 their scissors\n   - Round 8: My rock \u2192 their paper\n   - Round 9: My scissors \u2192 their rock  \n   - Round 10: My paper \u2192 their scissors\n\n4. Critical insight: My opponent just repeated scissors after using it in round 7! They chose scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This suggests they might be following their own pattern or cycle.\n\n5. My strategic thinking has been completely ineffective. Every time I try to predict their move or counter-think, I lose.

New approach needed: Instead of trying to predict them, let me look at what I haven't been doing. \n\n7. Looking at the frequency of my moves in the losing streak:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 7, 10)\n   - Rock: 1 time (round 8)  \n   - Scissors: 1 time (round 9)\n\n8. I've been favoring paper in my recent losses. Maybe I should avoid it entirely.\n\n9. Their last move was scissors. If I try to think about what they'll do next based on their recent pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), the next move might be paper.\n\n10. But given how badly my predictions have gone, I should probably just choose based on simple randomness or break my own patterns entirely.\n\n11. Rock is the move I've used least in my losing streak. Sometimes the simplest approach works when overthinking fails.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, breaking away from my recent pattern and going with the move I've underused in my losing streak.\n\n[move] rock"

If the pattern continues, their next move should be rock (restarting the cycle).\n\n5. Critical strategic moment: I've now won 3 consecutive rounds by exploiting their pattern. This is when most players would definitely adapt or break their pattern.\n\n6. However, the evidence suggests this might be a deeply ingrained strategic approach:\n   - The pattern survived my initial discovery and exploitation\n   - It continued even after they rotated it\n   - It's been consistent through both winning and losing streaks\n   - Some players commit to systematic approaches regardless of short-term results\n\n7. Key decision factors:\n   - Three straight losses for them should trigger change\n   - But the pattern has been remarkably persistent\n   - I'm still behind overall and need more wins\n   - This could be my chance to get back to positive territory\n\n8. Arguments for continuing:\n   - The pattern has never failed when I've correctly identified it\n   - Mathematical systems sometimes persist even when discovered\n   - I could reach -1 or even 0 points with another win\n\n9. Arguments for expecting change:\n   - Three losses in a row is typically a breaking point\n   - Adaptive players change when consistently beaten\n   - They might finally realize I've cracked their system\n\n10. Given the incredible consistency of this pattern and my need to recover points, I should exploit it once more. If they break it now, I'll have gained valuable ground and can adapt.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper to beat rock, continuing to exploit the rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle for one more round.\n\n[move] paper"
