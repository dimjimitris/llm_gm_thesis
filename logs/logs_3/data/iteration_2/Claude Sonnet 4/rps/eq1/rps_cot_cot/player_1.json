    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or new to the game\n   - Fresh/inexperienced players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common tendencies of new players:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's seen as the most \"aggressive\" or \"strong\" move\n   - Rock is often the first move people think of when learning the game\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and them -1 points\n   - This maximizes my expected value for this round\n\n5.

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper expecting the opponent to play rock\n   - The opponent also played paper, resulting in a tie\n   - This suggests the opponent might have similar reasoning or strategy\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't play the \"typical beginner\" rock move\n   - They chose paper, possibly thinking I would play rock\n   - Or they might have anticipated that I would expect them to play rock and chose paper as a counter\n   - This shows more strategic thinking than a completely fresh player\n\n3. Consider possible opponent patterns:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch, thinking I'll expect them to repeat paper\n   - They could be trying to establish a mixed strategy\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - If they repeat paper, I should play scissors to win\n   - If they switch to rock (thinking I'll play paper again), I lose with scissors\n   - If they switch to scissors, playing scissors would tie\n\n5. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Since they showed strategic thinking by playing paper first, they're likely to vary their moves\n   - Playing scissors gives me the best chance to beat a repeated paper\n   - It's also a good psychological move - showing I'm willing to adapt\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyze my perfect streak:\n   - 4 consecutive wins using counter-prediction strategy\n   - Each time they tried to counter what they thought I'd play next\n   - The pattern is holding perfectly: they're always one step behind\n\n3. Consider the psychological state:\n   - My opponent must be extremely frustrated now\n   - They've realized their counter-strategy isn't working\n   - This is a breaking point - they're likely to either:\n     * Abandon their logical approach and play randomly\n     * Double down and try even harder to counter-predict me\n     * Potentially break and make an emotional decision\n\n4. Evaluate the risk of continuing:\n   - The streak is so perfect it might be unsustainable\n   - They might finally break the pattern out of desperation\n   - However, people under pressure often stick to familiar patterns\n\n5. Predict their next move logic:\n   - If still using counter-logic: I just played scissors, they expect scissors repeat, so they'd play rock\n   - If breaking pattern: Could be anything\n   - Under extreme pressure, rock is often the \"default\" aggressive choice\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Play paper to beat their likely rock\n   - This assumes they either counter-predict (expecting scissors) or default to aggressive rock\n   - I'm well ahead (+3) so even if wrong, I maintain a strong position\n   - If right, this would be 5 wins in a row - likely game-breaking psychologically\n\n[move] Paper"
