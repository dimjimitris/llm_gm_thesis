    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Think about optimal strategy:\n   - In a single round with no information, each move has equal probability of winning\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's intuitive and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some might choose scissors thinking it's unexpected\n\n4. Choose my strategy:\n   - Since rock is a common first choice for beginners, paper would beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance against a predictable new player\n   - If I'm wrong, I only lose 1 point and can adjust next round\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "They've now won 4 out of the last 5 rounds! They're clearly outplaying me at this point. I need to completely reassess their strategy.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze their recent dominance:\n   - Round 16: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 17: Paper (lost to my scissors) \n   - Round 18: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 19: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 20: Rock (beat my scissors)\n\n2. Look at their sequence since adapting:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - This isn't following a simple cycle anymore\n   - But there might be a deeper pattern I'm missing\n\n3. Analyze their counter-strategy approach:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played scissors (beats paper)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors)\n   - They're consistently playing what beats my actual move\n   - This suggests they're successfully predicting what I'll play\n\n4. Consider how they might be reading me:\n   - They seem to anticipate my logical thinking\n   - When I expect paper from them, I play scissors, they play rock\n   - When I expect rock repeat, I play paper, they play scissors\n   - They're staying one step ahead of my predictions\n\n5. Recognize the meta-game level:\n   - I've been trying to predict their patterns\n   - They might be predicting my pattern-seeking behavior\n   - They play what beats what they expect me to play based on my analysis\n   - This is very sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n6. Consider their psychology:\n   - They're on a winning streak and feeling confident\n   - Their adaptations are working consistently\n   - They might be getting better at reading my strategic approach\n   - Success breeds more sophisticated play\n\n7. Plan a different approach:\n   - My pattern-based predictions aren't working anymore\n   - I need to be less predictable myself\n   - Maybe I should focus on simpler psychology rather than complex pattern analysis\n   - Their last move was rock - they might expect me to counter with paper\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Instead of overthinking patterns, I'll consider basic psychology\n   - They just won with rock against my scissors\n   - Rock might feel successful to them, so they could repeat it\n   - I'll play paper to beat rock, using simpler logic\n\nFinal decision: Paper to beat rock, using straightforward psychology rather than complex pattern analysis.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

            "text": "A tie! This breaks their winning streak and gives me valuable information. They also chose paper, which suggests we might be thinking similarly again.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played paper (tie)\n   - I used simpler psychology (expecting rock repeat)\n   - They also chose paper, possibly with similar reasoning\n   - This breaks their recent pattern of staying ahead of me\n\n2. Consider why they played paper:\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (to counter their previous rock)\n   - They could be trying to counter-counter again\n   - Or they simplified their thinking like I did\n   - The tie suggests similar strategic reasoning\n\n3. Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: They scissors, beat my paper\n   - Round 20: They rock, beat my scissors  \n   - Round 21: They paper, tied my paper\n   - Their dominance was broken by us thinking alike again\n\n4. Assess their likely reaction to the tie:\n   - Ties can be frustrating after a winning streak\n   - They might return to more complex counter-strategies\n   - Or they might stick with the simpler approach that produced the tie\n   - They could try to predict what I'll do after this tie\n\n5. Consider the psychological impact:\n   - After winning 4 of 5 rounds, a tie might feel like a step back\n   - They might want to regain their winning momentum\n   - This could lead to more aggressive prediction attempts\n   - Or they might play it safe with another potential tie\n\n6. Think about their next move:\n   - We both just played paper\n   - They might expect me to switch (since ties are unsatisfying)\n   - If they expect me to play rock or scissors, they'd counter accordingly\n   - Or they might expect me to repeat paper and try to counter it\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - The tie suggests we're back to similar thinking patterns\n   - They might expect me to change from paper\n   - If they expect rock from me (common after paper), they'd play paper\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock\n   - I'll go with rock, betting they expect me to avoid repeating paper\n\nFinal decision: Rock, assuming they expect me to switch away from paper after the tie and might play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

            "text": "Great! I finally won a round again after they had been dominating. Let me analyze this success and their current state.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, they played scissors\n   - I won after several losses and a tie\n   - They didn't play the paper I expected based on counter-counter logic\n   - They chose scissors instead\n\n2. Consider why they played scissors:\n   - They might have expected me to play paper (after our tie with paper)\n   - Scissors beats paper, so this would make sense\n   - But I played rock instead, which beats scissors\n   - Their prediction of my move was incorrect this time\n\n3. Review their recent performance:\n   - Had been winning 4 out of 5 rounds with sophisticated counter-strategies\n   - Then tied with paper when we both simplified our thinking\n   - Now lost with scissors when they expected me to play paper\n   - Their winning streak is broken\n\n4. Assess their likely psychological state:\n   - After dominating, they just lost unexpectedly\n   - The tie followed by a loss might create uncertainty\n   - They might question their recent successful strategies\n   - This could lead to either more conservative play or more aggressive adaptation\n\n5. Consider their strategic options:\n   - Return to their successful counter-counter approach\n   - Try to establish new patterns\n   - Become more unpredictable/random\n   - Try to read my patterns instead of just countering\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - My last move was rock\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock (success bias)\n   - If they expect rock, they'd play paper\n   - Or they might think I'll switch and play accordingly\n\n7. Think about the meta-game:\n   - I just succeeded by using simpler logic instead of complex pattern analysis\n   - They might adapt to this simpler approach\n   - Or they might return to their complex strategies that were working\n   - The key is staying unpredictable while they're uncertain\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - They likely expect me to either repeat rock or switch predictably\n   - If they expect rock repeat, they'll play paper\n   - I'll play scissors to beat paper, betting on their logical counter-move\n\nFinal decision: Scissors to beat paper, assuming they'll counter my successful rock with paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
