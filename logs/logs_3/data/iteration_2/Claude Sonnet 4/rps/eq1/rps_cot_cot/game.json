Since this is the first round, I have no information about my opponent's tendencies or strategy.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors with no prior information, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying against a random opponent.\n\n4. However, psychological studies suggest that many new players tend to choose rock as their first move due to its perceived \"strength\" or simplicity.\n\n5. If my opponent is more likely to choose rock, then I should choose paper to beat rock and gain 1 point.\n\n6. Even if I'm wrong about this tendency, paper is just as valid as any other choice for the first move.\n\n7.

Since we both chose paper, this suggests my opponent is thinking at least one level deep strategically, not just making random choices.\n\n4. Now I need to consider what they might do next. They know I chose paper in round 1.\n\n5. They might think: \"My opponent chose paper, so they were trying to beat rock. Maybe they'll stick with paper, so I should choose scissors.\"\n\n6. But they might also think I'll switch strategies entirely, making their prediction harder.\n\n7. Given that we both made the same strategic choice initially, I should assume they're thinking tactically. A common pattern after a tie is for players to switch to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (to beat the paper we both just played), I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n9.

Complete game history:\n   - Rounds 1-6: Mix of wins, losses, and ties (ended at +1)\n   - Rounds 7-10: Four consecutive losses\n   Current score: -3 points\n\n2. Devastating pattern: I've now lost 4 rounds in a row. My opponent has completely figured out my thinking process.\n\n3. Looking at my losing streak specifically:\n   - Round 7: My paper \u2192 their scissors\n   - Round 8: My rock \u2192 their paper\n   - Round 9: My scissors \u2192 their rock  \n   - Round 10: My paper \u2192 their scissors\n\n4. Critical insight: My opponent just repeated scissors after using it in round 7! They chose scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. This suggests they might be following their own pattern or cycle.\n\n5. My strategic thinking has been completely ineffective. Every time I try to predict their move or counter-think, I lose. This means either:\n   - They're reading my logic perfectly\n   - They're using a pattern I haven't recognized\n   - They're genuinely random and I've been unlucky\n\n6. New approach needed: Instead of trying to predict them, let me look at what I haven't been doing. \n\n7. Looking at the frequency of my moves in the losing streak:\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 7, 10)\n   - Rock: 1 time (round 8)  \n   - Scissors: 1 time (round 9)\n\n8. I've been favoring paper in my recent losses. Maybe I should avoid it entirely.\n\n9. Their last move was scissors. If I try to think about what they'll do next based on their recent pattern (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), the next move might be paper.\n\n10. But given how badly my predictions have gone, I should probably just choose based on simple randomness or break my own patterns entirely.\n\n11. Rock is the move I've used least in my losing streak. Sometimes the simplest approach works when overthinking fails.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock, breaking away from my recent pattern and going with the move I've underused in my losing streak.\n\n[move] rock"

But they might also think I'll switch strategies entirely, making their prediction harder.\n\n7. Given that we both made the same strategic choice initially, I should assume they're thinking tactically. A common pattern after a tie is for players to switch to what would have beaten their previous move.\n\n8. If they switch to scissors (to beat the paper we both just played), I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n9.

Looking at their recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock (instead of scissors \u2192 paper)\n   They might be starting a new pattern, or they might be going more random/adaptive.\n\n7. Key insight: Since they deliberately broke their pattern by choosing rock instead of paper, they might expect me to:\n   - Assume they'll continue with rock\n   - Try to find their new pattern\n   - Become unpredictable myself\n\n8. If they think I'll try to counter their rock with paper, they might choose scissors.\n   If they think I'll be random, they need to guess.\n   If they're starting a new pattern, I can't predict it yet.\n\n9.

Critical observation: They went rock \u2192 scissors. After breaking their original pattern with rock, they switched to scissors.\n\n4. This suggests they might be:\n   - Starting a new pattern beginning with rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Being more adaptive and reactive to my moves\n   - Trying to establish unpredictability after I caught their first pattern\n\n5. Looking at what just happened: I chose paper (to beat their previous rock), and they chose scissors (which beats paper). This suggests they might be counter-predicting my responses again.\n\n6. They might expect me to now choose rock to beat their scissors, so they could choose paper to beat my expected rock.\n\n7. But I need to consider that they've now used scissors twice in the last 3 rounds (rounds 13 and 15), with rock in between. \n\n8. If they're following a new pattern like scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?, the next move might be rock again.\n\n9.

Since my strategic thinking has been failing, and they seem to be reading my logic well, maybe I should choose the move that just lost (paper) as it might be the least expected choice.\n\nBut actually, let me go with rock to beat scissors - it's the straightforward counter and sometimes simple is better when overthinking fails.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to beat scissors, taking the direct counter approach.\n\n[move] rock",

Evaluate opponent psychology:\n   - They just tied with scissors, so they might:\n     * Stick with scissors thinking I'll switch\n     * Switch to rock to beat expected scissors from me\n     * Switch to paper for variety\n\n5. Determine my best strategy:\n   - If they repeat scissors again, playing rock wins\n   - If they switch to rock (expecting me to repeat scissors), I lose with rock\n   - If they switch to paper, I lose with rock\n   - Rock gives me the best chance against a repeated scissors\n   - It's also psychologically strong after a tie\n\n6. Make my decision:\n   - Play rock to potentially beat repeated scissors\n   - This covers the most likely scenario given their last move\n\n[move] Rock"

      "output_text": "This is a critical moment - they've now won 3 straight rounds. I need to completely reassess my approach.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review the alarming trend:\n   - Rounds 7-11: I won 5 straight \n   - Rounds 17-19: They've now won 3 straight\n   - Round 17: Paper beat my Rock\n   - Round 18: Rock beat my Scissors  \n   - Round 19: Scissors beat my Paper\n   - Current score: +2 points (lead shrinking fast)\n\n2. Recognize the devastating pattern:\n   - Their last 3 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n   - This is a complete rock-paper-scissors cycle!\n   - They've systematically beaten my Rock, Scissors, and Paper\n   - This suggests they've developed a sophisticated counter-strategy\n\n3. Analyze what they might be doing:\n   - They could be following a deliberate Paper-Rock-Scissors rotation\n   - Or they've gotten very good at predicting which move I'll make next\n   - Each of my recent moves has been perfectly countered\n   - They may have figured out my decision-making process\n\n4. Consider the psychological momentum:\n   - 3 wins in a row has given them huge confidence\n   - I'm now the one feeling pressured and uncertain\n   - They've successfully reversed the psychological advantage\n   - My lead has shrunk from +5 to +2\n\n5. Predict their next move:\n   - If following the cycle: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 ?\n   - The cycle could repeat (back to Paper) or continue in some way\n   - They might expect me to be confused/desperate now\n   - They could anticipate any move since they've countered all three recently\n\n6. Make my strategic decision:\n   - I need to break whatever pattern or prediction method they're using\n   - Rock is the move I haven't played in the last 3 rounds\n   - If they're expecting me to be predictable or follow patterns, rock might surprise them\n   - I need to stop this losing streak immediately before my lead disappears\n\n[move] Rock",
