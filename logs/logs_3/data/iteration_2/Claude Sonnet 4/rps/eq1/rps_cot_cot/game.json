Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I need to consider what move gives me the best expected outcome.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, if my opponent chooses randomly (which is likely for a fresh player with no strategy), then all three moves have equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n4. However, there are psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some players avoid scissors initially because it seems \"weak\"\n\n5. Given that many players default to rock on their first move, paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper has an equal 1/3 chance against any random strategy, but exploits the common rock bias.\n\n**Final reasoning:** Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll capitalize on the common tendency for new players to choose rock as their opening move.\n\n[move] paper"

Now I have one data point: my opponent chose paper in round 1. This suggests they may be thinking strategically rather than randomly.\n\n4. Common psychological patterns after a tie:\n   - Some players stick with the same move that tied\n   - Others switch to try to \"win\" the previous exchange retroactively\n   - Strategic players might try to counter what they think I'll do next\n\n5. If my opponent thinks I might stick with paper (since it tied), they might choose scissors to beat paper.\n\n6.

I now have eleven data points on my opponent:\n   - Round 1: paper\n   - Round 2: scissors  \n   - Round 3: rock\n   - Round 4: paper\n   - Round 5: scissors\n   - Round 6: rock\n   - Round 7: rock (broke pattern)\n   - Round 8: paper \n   - Round 9: scissors\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: paper\n\n2. My score is now +7 points (exceptional performance).\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - The pattern continues with remarkable consistency: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They've now completed 3+ full cycles with only one deviation in round 7\n   - Pattern reliability: 10 out of 11 rounds following the cycle (91% consistency)\n\n4. Current cycle position:\n   - Following their established pattern, the next move should be scissors (second move in the cycle after paper)\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - I've now won 7 out of the last 8 rounds by exploiting this pattern\n   - My opponent shows extraordinary commitment to systematic play\n   - The single break in round 7 remains an isolated incident\n   - They appear unable or unwilling to adapt their strategy despite consistent losses\n\n6. Psychological considerations:\n   - After losing so many rounds, most players would have changed strategy\n   - This opponent either doesn't recognize the exploitation or is committed to their system regardless of results\n   - This level of predictability is extremely rare and valuable to exploit\n\n7. Expected move prediction:\n   - Pattern suggests: scissors (next in paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock sequence)\n   - Probability of following pattern: extremely high based on 10/11 consistency\n\n**Final reasoning:** With 91% pattern consistency over 11 rounds and having won 7 of the last 8 games, my opponent remains extraordinarily predictable. Following their cycle, scissors should be next. Rock beats scissors, continuing my winning streak.\n\n[move] rock"

In rock-paper-scissors, if my opponent chooses randomly (which is likely for a fresh player with no strategy), then all three moves have equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\n4. However, there are psychological tendencies in rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Many beginners tend to throw rock first (it's the first option mentioned and feels \"strong\")\n   - Some players avoid scissors initially because it seems \"weak\"\n\n5. Given that many players default to rock on their first move, paper would beat rock and give me +1 points.\n\n6. Even if they don't choose rock, paper has an equal 1/3 chance against any random strategy, but exploits the common rock bias.\n\n**Final reasoning:** Since this is against a fresh player with no established pattern, I'll capitalize on the common tendency for new players to choose rock as their opening move.\n\n[move] paper",

Strategic assessment:\n   - Their paper choice suggests they might be comfortable returning to systematic play\n   - If they continue with scissors (next in either interpretation of the cycle), rock would beat it\n   - If they try to be unpredictable again, I need to make my best guess\n\n7. The fact that they chose paper (which fits the cycle) after breaking it suggests they may be settling back into their pattern.\n\n**Final reasoning:** Their choice of paper in round 8 suggests they may be resuming their systematic approach after the one-time deviation. If they continue with scissors (the logical next move in their cycle), rock will beat it. Given their demonstrated tendency toward systematic play, I'll assume they're returning to the pattern.\n\n[move] rock",

My score is now +5 points (back to my previous high).\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - After the one-time deviation in round 7, they've returned to the cycle\n   - Round 8: paper, Round 9: scissors follows their systematic pattern\n   - This suggests they're back to their reliable paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock sequence\n\n4. Strategic assessment:\n   - The deviation in round 7 appears to have been temporary\n   - They've now resumed their predictable cycling behavior\n   - Following the pattern, their next move should be rock\n\n5. Confidence level:\n   - They showed they can break the pattern (round 7) but then returned to it\n   - This suggests they're more comfortable with systematic play\n   - The fact that they went back to the cycle after one deviation indicates strong preference for this approach\n\n6. Decision considerations:\n   - If they continue the pattern with rock, paper would beat rock (+1 point)\n   - If they deviate again, I'm back to uncertainty\n   - Given that they returned to the pattern after one break, the odds favor continuation\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - They've proven they can adapt (round 7), but they chose to return to the cycle\n   - This suggests the systematic approach is their default preference\n   - The pattern has been reliable in 7 out of 8 recent rounds\n\n**Final reasoning:** After one deviation, my opponent returned to their systematic paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock cycle for two consecutive rounds. This suggests they prefer predictable play despite knowing they can break patterns. Following the cycle, rock should be next, so paper will beat it.\n\n[move] paper",

Look at what beats what in sequence:\n   - Round 2: My scissors vs their rock (rock beats scissors)\n   - Round 3: My rock vs their paper (paper beats rock)\n   - Round 4: My paper vs their scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - Round 5: My scissors vs their rock (rock beats scissors)\n\n4. Critical realization:\n   - In rounds 2-5, my opponent chose the exact move that beats what I chose\n   - This suggests they are either:\n     a) Predicting my moves with high accuracy\n     b) Using some counter-strategy I haven't identified\n     c) Getting lucky with a pattern that happens to counter mine\n\n5. New strategic approach:\n   - My previous attempts at pattern recognition and counter-prediction have failed\n   - I need to either:\n     a) Try to be completely unpredictable\n     b) Try to predict what they think I'll predict\n     c) Look for a different kind of pattern\n\n6. Meta-level thinking:\n   - They might expect me to choose rock (since they just played rock and many people avoid repeating what their opponent just played)\n   - Or they might expect me to try to counter their rock with paper\n   - I'm losing badly, so I need to take a calculated risk\n\n7. Decision:\n   - I'll choose rock, going against the obvious counter-move logic\n   - This might catch them off guard if they're expecting me to choose paper to beat their previous rock\n\n[move] Rock"

Acknowledge the pattern of my failures:\n   - Every time I try to predict or counter-predict, I lose\n   - My opponent seems to consistently choose the move that beats mine\n   - All my strategic thinking has backfired\n\n3. Consider what might be happening:\n   - My opponent might be reading my logical patterns\n   - They could be exploiting my tendency to overthink\n   - Perhaps they're using a strategy that counters analytical approaches\n\n4. Radical strategy shift:\n   - Stop trying to be clever or analytical\n   - Stop looking for patterns in their moves\n   - Stop trying to predict what they'll do\n   - Instead, make a completely arbitrary choice\n\n5. Simple decision process:\n   - I have three options: rock, paper, scissors\n   - Each has equal probability of winning against a random opponent\n   - Since all my \"smart\" choices have failed, I'll make a basic choice\n   - Rock is simple and straightforward\n\n6. Make the decision:\n   - No complex reasoning this time\n   - Just pick rock and see what happens\n   - Sometimes the simplest approach works when complexity fails\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyze what was different in Round 7:\n   - I abandoned complex strategic thinking\n   - I made a simple, straightforward choice\n   - I stopped trying to predict patterns\n   - This approach worked where all my \"clever\" strategies failed\n\n3. Consider opponent's move sequence now:\n   - Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors\n   - They chose scissors, which lost to my rock\n\n4. Resist the urge to over-analyze:\n   - My previous mistake was getting too caught up in pattern recognition\n   - The moment I simplified my approach, I won\n   - I should be cautious about falling back into overthinking\n\n5. Strategy for Round 8:\n   - Continue with the simplified approach that just worked\n   - Don't try to predict what they'll do based on their previous scissors\n   - Make another straightforward choice\n   - Paper is equally valid as rock was\n\n6.

Develop my strategy:\n   - If I assume the opponent is likely to choose rock (common beginner choice), I should choose paper to beat rock\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning (+1 point) against a predictable opponent\n   - Even if I'm wrong, I only risk losing 1 point, and there's still a chance of a tie\n\n5.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.
