Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - Fresh players often don't have established patterns yet\n\n3. Develop initial strategy:\n   - Since this is the first round, I have no information about opponent's tendencies\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, the optimal strategy against an unknown opponent is to play randomly\n   - However, many beginners have slight biases (rock is often chosen first by new players)\n\n4. Make my choice:\n   - Rock is commonly chosen by beginners as it feels \"strong\"\n   - If my opponent chooses rock, I should choose paper\n   - Paper seems like a reasonable first move to counter potential rock bias\n\n[move] (I'll start with paper, as many new players tend to choose rock initially) paper",
