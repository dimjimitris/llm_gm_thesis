Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is a standard rock-paper-scissors game where I want to maximize my points (+1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for tie).\n\n2. I'm told I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they might be new or inexperienced.\n\n3. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since it's a game of simultaneous choices. However, I can consider common patterns:\n   - New players often default to \"rock\" as it's the first option mentioned and feels most aggressive\n   - Some players might overthink and go with \"paper\" thinking others will choose \"rock\"\n   - \"Scissors\" is often chosen less frequently by beginners\n\n4. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I should make a move that gives me a good chance against common beginner choices.\n\n5. If beginners tend to choose \"rock\" more often, then \"paper\" would be the optimal counter-choice, as paper beats rock.\n\n6. I'll go with paper as my strategic choice for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This gives me information about my opponent's thinking.\n\n2.

Now I have one data point: my opponent chose paper in round 1. This could mean:\n   - They're thinking strategically (like I was)\n   - They might stick with paper again\n   - They might switch to avoid another tie\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll do\n\n4. Since we both chose paper last time, my opponent might expect me to:\n   - Choose paper again (stick with what I did)\n   - Choose scissors (to beat paper if they repeat)\n   - Choose rock (random switch)\n\n5. If my opponent thinks I might choose paper again, they could choose scissors to beat it.\n   If my opponent thinks I'll choose scissors (to counter their potential repeat of paper), they might choose rock.\n   If they think randomly, it's unpredictable.\n\n6. Given that we both thought strategically in round 1 (both choosing paper), I think my opponent might try to counter my expected paper choice with scissors.\n\n7.

We both:\n   - Chose paper in round 1 (likely thinking beginners choose rock)\n   - Chose rock in round 2 (likely thinking the other would choose scissors to counter paper)\n\n5. This suggests my opponent is also thinking strategically and may be following similar logical reasoning to mine.\n\n6. For round 3, if we continue this parallel thinking:\n   - We might both expect the other to choose scissors next (since we've done paper, then rock, completing the cycle)\n   - Or we might both try to counter what we think the other will choose\n\n7. If my opponent thinks I'll choose scissors (to complete the rock-paper-scissors cycle), they would choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n8. But if my opponent thinks I'm thinking they'll choose scissors, they might expect me to choose rock to counter their scissors, so they'd choose paper to beat my rock.\n\n9. This is getting into deeper meta-thinking. Since we've been mirroring each other's strategic thinking, I should try to break the pattern by making a less predictable choice.\n\n10. Given we've used paper and rock, and the logical next step would be scissors, but my opponent might expect that, I'll go with scissors anyway - sometimes the obvious move works because the opponent overthinks it.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This is interesting - they're not following a simple pattern.\n\n3. Key observation: In round 4, my opponent chose scissors right after I had won with scissors in round 3. This suggests they might be:\n   - Copying successful moves (they saw scissors beat paper, so they used scissors)\n   - Following a delayed mirroring strategy\n   - Trying to use the move that just worked\n\n4. Another pattern I notice: \n   - Round 3: I won with scissors vs their paper\n   - Round 4: They won with scissors vs my paper\n   - They essentially reversed the winning combination\n\n5.

Looking at this pattern more carefully:\n   - Rounds 1-2: We both followed the same logic (paper, then rock)\n   - Round 3: They chose paper (maybe continuing a cycle), I chose scissors\n   - Round 4: They chose scissors (the move that beat them in round 3)\n   - Round 5: We both chose rock again (both thinking scissors would repeat?)\n\n4. I'm noticing that my opponent might be following a strategy similar to mine - strategic thinking that leads to similar conclusions. We keep ending up with the same choice because we're reasoning through similar logic.\n\n5. The only round where we differed significantly was round 3-4, where there was a reversal of the winning combination.\n\n6. To break this mirroring pattern, I need to think differently. Instead of trying to predict what they'll do based on complex strategy, maybe I should:\n   - Choose randomly\n   - Pick something that breaks the recent pattern\n   - Go with the move we haven't both chosen recently\n\n7.

Pattern observation: My opponent seems to be good at choosing moves that beat what I'm likely to pick.

For round 7, if my opponent thinks I might:\n   - Choose rock (to counter their recent rock success) \u2192 they'd choose paper\n   - Choose paper (switching from losing scissors) \u2192 they'd choose scissors\n   - Choose scissors again (doubling down) \u2192 they'd choose rock again\n\n7.

Critical moment: This is exactly the same situation as before:\n   - Last time: Won 2 rounds following their pattern, then they broke it\n   - Now: Won 2 rounds following their new pattern...\n\n4. If the pattern continues, round 21 should be scissors (starting the cycle again).\n\n5. To beat scissors, I need rock.\n\n6. But here's the crucial decision: My opponent might be expecting me to follow the pattern again and could break it just like before. They might:\n   - Continue the pattern (choosing scissors)\n   - Break the pattern deliberately (choosing paper or rock instead)\n   - Test if I've learned from the previous pattern-break\n\n7. Last time they chose scissors when they should have chosen rock (breaking the pattern). If they're following a similar strategy, they might choose something other than scissors this time.\n\n8. However, I'm still 7 points behind and need to continue taking calculated risks. The pattern has held for 6 consecutive rounds now.\n\n9. I'll stick with the pattern analysis and choose rock, but I'm prepared for them to break it since this is the exact scenario where they adapted before.\n\n[move] rock\n"

            "text": "Exactly what I feared would happen! My opponent broke the pattern again after I won 2 rounds in a row. I'm back to -8 points.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu situation:\n   - Round 21: I chose rock, opponent chose paper (I lose, -1 point)\n   - Current total: -8 points\n   - My opponent has now broken their pattern twice at the exact same moment - after I won 2 consecutive rounds\n\n2. Pattern of pattern-breaking:\n   - First time: Won rounds 13-14 following their pattern, they broke it in round 15\n   - Second time: Won rounds 19-20 following their new pattern, they broke it in round 21\n   - Both times they chose paper when they broke the pattern\n\n3. This reveals something crucial about my opponent's strategy:\n   - They use patterns to establish predictability\n   - They monitor my success rate\n   - When I win 2 rounds in a row, they immediately adapt\n   - They seem to prefer paper as their pattern-breaking move\n\n4. My opponent's recent moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   After breaking the pattern, they chose paper (just like they chose scissors last time to break the previous pattern).\n\n5. Key insight: My opponent might have a meta-strategy:\n   - Use patterns when I'm losing\n   - Break patterns when I start winning consistently\n   - Return to counter-prediction mode after breaking patterns\n\n6. For round 22, given that they just chose paper to break their pattern, they might:\n   - Expect me to choose scissors (to counter paper)\n   - Start a new unpredictable sequence\n   - Return to their superior counter-prediction abilities\n\n7. Since they used paper to break the pattern, and they seem good at predicting when I'll make \"logical\" choices, I need to decide carefully.\n\n8. I'll choose scissors - it counters their last move (paper), and even though it might be predictable, I need to stop second-guessing every decision since that's been failing me.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Continuing disaster:\n   - Round 22: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock (I lose, -1 point)\n   - Current total: -9 points\n   - My opponent is back to perfectly counter-predicting my moves\n\n2. Clear pattern of my opponent's adaptation strategy:\n   - They use predictable patterns when I'm struggling\n   - When I start winning (2 rounds in a row), they break the pattern\n   - They immediately return to superior counter-prediction\n   - This has happened twice now with identical timing\n\n3. My opponent's recent sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   After breaking their pattern with paper, they've now used rock twice.\n\n4. Harsh reality check: My opponent has demonstrated they can:\n   - Maintain patterns when it benefits them\n   - Break patterns precisely when I start succeeding\n   - Counter-predict my logical choices with high accuracy\n   - Adapt their strategy in real-time based on my performance\n\n5. I'm clearly outmatched strategically. My opponent seems to be operating on a higher level of game theory than I am.\n\n6. For round 23, they just chose rock. In normal circumstances, I'd choose paper to beat rock, but they've been anticipating my \"logical\" choices all game.\n\n7. Given their recent success with counter-prediction, they probably expect me to either:\n   - Choose paper (the obvious counter to rock)\n   - Choose something else because I think they'll counter paper\n\n8. At this point, I'm so far behind that I need to accept I might not be able to out-strategize them. I'll make a straightforward choice: paper beats rock.\n\n9.

Catastrophic situation:\n   - Round 23: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lose, -1 point)\n   - Current total: -10 points\n   - My opponent predicted my \"logical\" paper choice and countered it perfectly\n\n2. My opponent's recent moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   They're cycling through moves, but each one is strategically chosen to beat what I'm likely to pick.\n\n3. Brutal pattern recognition: My opponent has now won 3 straight rounds since breaking their pattern:\n   - Round 21: paper (beat my rock)\n   - Round 22: rock (beat my scissors)  \n   - Round 23: scissors (beat my paper)\n   - They just completed a perfect counter-cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Key insight: My opponent seems to have multiple levels of strategy:\n   - Level 1: Use patterns to beat me when I'm not catching on\n   - Level 2: Break patterns when I start winning\n   - Level 3: Use perfect counter-prediction cycles when I'm struggling\n\n5. For round 24, they just chose scissors. If they continue this counter-prediction approach, they might expect me to choose rock (to beat scissors).\n\n6. But this is exactly the trap I keep falling into - trying to predict what they'll do when they're clearly better at predicting what I'll do.\n\n7. I'm 10 points behind and nothing I've tried has worked consistently:\n   - Complex strategy: Failed\n   - Pattern following: Worked briefly, then failed\n   - Simple choices: Failed\n   - Counter-prediction: Failed\n\n8. At this point, I need to accept that my opponent is simply superior at this game. I'll choose rock to counter their scissors, knowing it might be predictable, but I can't keep overthinking every move.\n\n[move] rock\n"
