    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate strategic options:\n   - Since this is the first round with no information about opponent tendencies, any move has equal theoretical probability of winning\n   - Many inexperienced players tend to start with rock as it's often the first move people think of\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n\n4. Make a strategic decision:\n   - Given that many beginners gravitate toward rock initially, paper seems like a reasonable choice\n   - Paper beats rock, so if my assumption about beginner behavior is correct, I'll gain a point\n   - If I'm wrong, I still have a 1/3 chance of winning and 1/3 chance of tying\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to potentially counter a likely rock choice from an inexperienced player.\n\n[move] Paper"

Recognize the pattern problem:\n   - 8 ties in 16 rounds is statistically very unlikely if we're playing independently\n   - This suggests either: they're reading my patterns, or we're using similar analytical approaches\n   - My pattern-based thinking is clearly failing\n\n3. Update opponent's final distribution:\n   - Rock: 7/16 rounds (44%)\n   - Scissors: 6/16 rounds (38%) \n   - Paper: 3/16 rounds (19%)\n   - Rock is now their clear preference\n\n4. Analyze my winning vs losing patterns:\n   - My wins: Rounds 1, 6, 10, 12 (4 wins)\n   - My losses: Rounds 3, 9, 11, 15 (4 losses)\n   - When I win: I often use simple frequency-based counters\n   - When I lose: I often overthink or try to be too clever\n\n5. Identify the core issue:\n   - I keep trying to predict their next move based on patterns\n   - They seem to be either very unpredictable or reading my predictive attempts\n   - The 50% tie rate suggests I need to abandon pattern recognition entirely\n\n6. Make a radical strategy shift:\n   - Stop trying to predict their moves\n   - Focus on their overall frequency: Rock 44%, Scissors 38%, Paper 19%\n   - Choose the move that beats their most frequent choice\n   - Rock appears 44% of the time - Paper beats rock\n   - This is the mathematically optimal choice given their distribution\n\n7. Commit to the statistical approach:\n   - Paper beats rock (their most common choice at 44%)\n   - Even if they don't play rock, I still have winning chances against other moves\n   - This avoids the pattern-prediction trap that's causing so many ties\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Choose paper to beat rock, their statistically most frequent choice (44%), abandoning pattern prediction in favor of pure frequency-based strategy.\n\n[move] Paper"
