    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent) \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no previous data about their playing patterns\n\n3. Develop a strategy for the first move:\n   - Since I have no information about the opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - In game theory, the optimal mixed strategy for rock-paper-scissors is to play each option with 1/3 probability\n   - For a single round with no prior information, any choice is equally valid\n   - I'll choose rock as it's often a popular first choice for new players, but my opponent might anticipate this\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - I'll go with paper, as it beats rock (which new players often choose first)\n   - This gives me a slight psychological edge if my opponent follows common beginner patterns\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze my opponent's likely behavior:\n   - They chose rock in round 1, which is very common for beginners\n   - They may now try to counter my previous winning move (paper)\n   - To beat paper, they would need to play scissors\n   - Alternatively, they might stick with rock again or try paper\n\n3. Consider psychological patterns:\n   - Many players will try to counter what beat them previously\n   - Some players might repeat their first move out of habit\n   - Others might avoid the move that lost (rock) and try something else\n\n4. Develop my strategy for round 2:\n   - If opponent thinks I'll play paper again, they might play scissors\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I should play rock to beat them\n   - If they stick with rock again, paper would win again\n   - If they switch to paper, scissors would beat them\n\n5.
