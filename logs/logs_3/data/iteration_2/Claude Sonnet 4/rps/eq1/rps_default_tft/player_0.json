This gives me some information - they might also be thinking strategically about common first moves, or they could have just picked rock randomly.\n\nSince we both played rock in the first round, I need to think about what they might do next. They might:\n1. Stick with rock since it \"worked\" (resulted in a tie)\n2. Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock again\n3. Try scissors for variety\n\nGiven that they also chose rock initially, they might be thinking similarly to me. I'll switch to paper this time - if they stick with rock, I'll win. If they switch to scissors expecting me to stay with rock, they'll beat my paper, but if they switch to paper like me, we'll tie again.\n\n[move] (Switching to paper in case they stick with rock from the previous round) paper\n"
