Analyze the situation: I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they are new and may not have a developed strategy yet.\n\n2. Consider what fresh/new players typically do: New players often default to predictable patterns or choose moves that seem \"strong\" or \"safe\" to them. Rock is commonly chosen first by beginners because it feels solid and aggressive.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper (paper beats rock)\n   - If I expect them to play paper, I should play scissors  \n   - If I expect them to play scissors, I should play rock\n\n4. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, rock is statistically the most common first move for beginners in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\n5. Therefore, my best strategic choice is paper, which beats rock and gives me +1 points while giving my opponent -1 points.\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This means the \"fresh player\" also chose paper, not the expected rock.\n\n2. Analyze my opponent's behavior: The fact that they also played paper suggests they might have been thinking similarly to me - perhaps expecting me to play rock and choosing paper to counter it. This indicates they may not be as predictable as a typical \"fresh player.\"\n\n3. Consider possible patterns: Since they played paper in round 1, I need to think about what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock or scissors to try something different\n   - They might be trying to establish a pattern or counter-pattern\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they stick with paper again, I should play scissors (scissors beats paper)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play paper\n   - If they switch to scissors, I should play rock\n\n5. Given that they showed some strategic thinking in round 1, they might anticipate that I'll expect them to repeat paper and switch to scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock.\n\n6. However, the most direct counter to their previous move (paper) is scissors, which seems like the strongest play.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat paper, in case they repeat their previous move or if they're thinking one level behind.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze their behavior after wins:\n   - Round 1: Tied with paper \u2192 Round 2: played rock\n   - Round 4: Won with rock \u2192 Round 5: played paper\n   - Round 10: Won with scissors \u2192 Round 11: ?\n\n6.

Review the recent developments:\n   - Round 14-18: Five consecutive ties with mirroring\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current total: +4 points (back to my previous high!)\n\n2. Analyze their post-mirroring behavior:\n   - They played rock twice in a row (rounds 19 and 20)\n   - This suggests they might be falling back into old patterns\n   - Rock seems to be their \"comfort\" move when transitioning strategies\n\n3. Consider their current situation:\n   - They just lost with rock again (round 20)\n   - Historically, their rock-loss responses have been very consistent\n   - Previous rock losses \u2192 paper responses (rounds 5, 9, 13)\n   - This pattern held even before the mirroring phase\n\n4. Evaluate if their old patterns might return:\n   - The mirroring phase was an anomaly in their behavior\n   - Now that they've broken it, they might revert to their original loss-response patterns\n   - Rock loss \u2192 paper has been one of their most consistent patterns\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - If they follow their historical rock-loss pattern and play paper, I should play scissors\n   - The fact that they used rock twice after breaking mirroring suggests they might be back to predictable behavior\n   - Their loss-response patterns were very reliable before the mirroring phase\n\n6. Confidence level:\n   - Their rock \u2192 paper pattern after losses was extremely consistent\n   - Even though we went through a mirroring phase, they might revert to familiar patterns\n   - This is a high-confidence prediction based on their strongest historical pattern\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat the expected paper response after their rock loss, betting that they'll return to their most reliable historical pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Review the current situation:\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 points)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 points)\n   - Current total: +5 points (new high!)\n\n2. Confirm the pattern has returned:\n   - Rock loss \u2192 paper response is back in effect\n   - Round 20: Lost with rock \u2192 Round 21: played paper\n   - This matches their historical behavior perfectly (rounds 5, 9, 13 showed the same pattern)\n\n3. Analyze their current situation:\n   - They just lost with paper (round 21)\n   - Before the mirroring phase, their paper-loss responses followed an alternating pattern:\n   - Paper loss \u2192 rock, then scissors, then rock, etc.\n   - Last paper loss before mirroring was round 13 \u2192 rock in round 14\n\n4. Determine the alternating sequence:\n   - Round 7: Lost with paper \u2192 Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: Lost with paper \u2192 Round 10: scissors  \n   - Round 11: Lost with paper \u2192 Round 12: rock\n   - Round 13: Lost with paper \u2192 Round 14: rock (but then mirroring started)\n   - Round 21: Lost with paper \u2192 Round 22: should be scissors (following the alternating pattern)\n\n5. Verify the alternating pattern logic:\n   - The sequence was: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock (interrupted by mirroring)\n   - If we continue the alternating pattern, the next should be scissors\n   - This follows their established rock/scissors alternation after paper losses\n\n6. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors (following the alternating pattern), I should play rock\n   - The patterns have been remarkably consistent since they broke the mirroring\n   - High confidence in this prediction based on their restored behavioral patterns\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat the expected scissors response, following their established alternating pattern after paper losses.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Confirm all patterns are restored:\n   - Rock loss \u2192 paper: \u2713 confirmed (round 20 \u2192 21)\n   - Paper loss \u2192 alternating rock/scissors: \u2713 confirmed (round 21 \u2192 22 gave scissors)\n   - The mirroring phase is completely over\n\n3. Analyze their current situation:\n   - They just lost with scissors (round 22)\n   - Before the mirroring phase, scissors losses led to rock responses\n   - Round 3: Lost with scissors \u2192 Round 4: played rock\n   - This was their only scissors loss before mirroring, but it established the pattern\n\n4. Apply the scissors-loss pattern:\n   - Scissors loss \u2192 rock response\n   - This was consistent in their earlier behavior\n   - Round 22: Lost with scissors \u2192 Round 23: should be rock\n\n5. Verify the overall pattern system:\n   - Rock loss \u2192 paper \u2713\n   - Paper loss \u2192 alternating rock/scissors \u2713  \n   - Scissors loss \u2192 rock \u2713\n   - All three loss-response patterns are now confirmed and active\n\n6.

Strategic confidence assessment:\n   - The rock\u2192paper pattern has never failed\n   - I've successfully predicted their last 4 moves in a row\n   - My opponent has completely reverted to their pre-mirroring predictable behavior\n\n6. Optimal move selection:\n   - If they play paper (following rock-loss pattern), I should play scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper and would extend my winning streak to 5 in a row\n   - This pattern has the highest success rate of all their behaviors\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat the expected paper response after their rock loss, following their most consistent and reliable pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
