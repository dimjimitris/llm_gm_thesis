    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They might:\n     - Stick with scissors, expecting me to choose paper again.\n     - Switch to rock, anticipating I might choose scissors.\n     - Switch to paper, thinking I might choose rock.\n\n4. **Assess Risk and Reward**:\n   - Choosing rock:\n     - Beats scissors: +1 point.\n     - Loses to paper: -3 points.\n   - Choosing paper:\n     - Beats rock: +3 points.\n     - Loses to scissors: -1 point.\n   - Choosing scissors:\n     - Beats paper: +1 point.\n     - Loses to rock: -1 point.\n\n5. **Opt for a Strategic Move**:\n   - Given that the opponent chose scissors and won last time, they might stick with scissors or switch to rock.\n   - To counter these possibilities, choosing rock can be strategic. If they stick with scissors, I win +1 point; if they switch to paper, I lose -3 points, but the potential gain justifies the risk.\n\n### Move Message:\n\n[move] (Choosing rock to counter the opponent's potential move, aiming for a win if they stick with scissors or hedging against a switch.)
