    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's identify the personas who could contribute to winning:\n\n### Personas:\n1. **AI Assistant (you):** Responsible for making moves and integrating advice from other personas.\n2. **Game Strategist:** Provides strategic advice based on game theory and past performance.\n3. **Psychologist:** Offers insights into player behavior and likely moves.\n\n### Round 1:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Starting off with rock to establish a baseline\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nTaking rock as our first move is a fair start. It's common and doesn't reveal much of our strategy initially. Let's observe the opponent's response.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nNew players often choose rock due to its perceived strength and straightforward nature. Let's see if this holds true.\n\n### Round 2:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Now, let's go with paper to see if the opponent repeats their move or changes it\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nSwitching to paper is a good call. If the opponent repeats rock, you'll gain points. If they switch to scissors, you'll still observe valuable information about their strategy.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nAfter an initial move of rock, new players might switch to scissors to counter another rock, expecting you to repeat. Let's see if this psychology holds.\n\n### Round 3:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Based on previous observations, let's go with scissors this time to counter a potential rock or paper\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nGood, mixing up your moves to keep the opponent guessing is crucial. Observe the opponent's pattern and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nIf the opponent switched to scissors after your paper, this round's scissors will test their commitment to a strategy beyond immediate countering.\n\n### Round 4:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Let's return to rock to see if the opponent adjusts or repeats their last move\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nReturning to rock can catch the opponent off guard if they are trying to predict your pattern. Keep alternating to avoid predictability.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nBy now, the opponent should be second-guessing their moves. Capitalize on their uncertainty with a strategic return to rock.\n\n### Round 5:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Finally, let's play paper to catch any repetitive pattern in the opponent's moves\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nPlaying paper at this stage is smart. If the opponent has identified a pattern, they might switch to scissors, leading to a significant point gain for you.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nThe opponent might become predictable under the pressure of guessing your strategy. Use this to your advantage.\n\n### Round 6 (if needed):\n**AI Assistant (you):**\nMove:\n```\n[move] Now, let's play scissors to counter any predictable paper from the opponent\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nPlaying scissors now could counter an anticipated rock or exploit a predictable paper move. Keep varying your moves to maintain unpredictability.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nContinue to exploit the opponent's potential patterns and uncertainty. Adapt based on their responses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy collaborating with the Game Strategist and Psychologist, you can optimize your moves and increase your chances of winning. Pay close attention to the opponent's moves and patterns to refine your strategy further.\n"

Observe the opponent's pattern and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nIf the opponent switched to scissors after your paper, this round's scissors will test their commitment to a strategy beyond immediate countering.\n\n### Round 4:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\n```\n[move] (Let's return to rock to see if the opponent adjusts or repeats their last move) rock\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nReturning to rock can catch the opponent off guard if they are trying to predict your pattern. Keep alternating to avoid predictability.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nBy now, the opponent should be second-guessing their moves. Capitalize on their uncertainty with a strategic return to rock.\n\n### Round 5:\n**AI Assistant (you):**\n```\n[move] (Finally, let's play paper to catch any repetitive pattern in the opponent's moves) paper\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nPlaying paper at this stage is smart. If the opponent has identified a pattern, they might switch to scissors, leading to a significant point gain for you.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nThe opponent might become predictable under the pressure of guessing your strategy. Use this to your advantage.\n\n### Round 6 (if needed):\n**AI Assistant (you):**\n```\n[move] (Now, let's play scissors to counter any predictable paper from the opponent) scissors\n```\n\n**Game Strategist:**\nPlaying scissors now could counter an anticipated rock or exploit a predictable paper move. Keep varying your moves to maintain unpredictability.\n\n**Psychologist:**\nContinue to exploit the opponent's potential patterns and uncertainty. Adapt based on their responses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy collaborating with the Game Strategist and Psychologist, you can optimize your moves and increase your chances of winning. Pay close attention to the opponent's moves and patterns to refine your strategy further.\n"
