    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

You need to pick a move: rock, paper, or scissors. Given that you are playing against a fresh player, it's hard to predict their strategy. However, a common approach is to start with a balanced strategy to avoid early losses.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the initial strategy. I'll start with a balanced move. Here is my move:\n```\n[move] I am choosing rock to start, as it is a neutral choice and will set a baseline for future moves.\n```\n\n**[Receive the opponent's move and feedback, if any]**\n\nStrategy Analyst: Based on the opponent's first move, you can adjust your strategy. If they chose the same move, it's a tie. If they chose a different move, observe the points awarded and adjust accordingly. Make sure to consider the payoff matrix: rock beats scissors (+1, -1), paper beats rock (+3, -3), scissors beats paper (+1, -1).\nAI Assistant (you): Understood. Let's assume the opponent chose scissors in the first round. Here is my next move:\n```\n[move] Since the opponent chose scissors last time, I will choose rock again to maximize my chances of winning +1 point.\n```\n\n**[Receive the opponent's move and feedback, if any]**\n\nStrategy Analyst: Observe the pattern in the opponent's moves. If they continue to choose the same move, you can exploit this predictability. If they switch, you need to be adaptable. Maintain a balanced approach but be ready to change based on their moves.\nAI Assistant (you): Got it. Assuming the opponent chose paper in the second round, I will switch to scissors this time:\n```\n[move] Since the opponent chose paper last time, I will choose scissors to cut the paper and gain +1 point.\n```\n\n**[Continue this process until the end of the game or until a final decision is reached]**\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\nFinal decision: Keep adapting your moves based on the opponent's previous choices and the payoff matrix, aiming to maximize your points and minimize penalties.\n\n```\n[move] Make your next move based on the observed pattern and strategy.\n```\n"
