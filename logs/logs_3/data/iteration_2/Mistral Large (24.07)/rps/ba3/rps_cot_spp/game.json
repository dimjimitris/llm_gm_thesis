Provides insights on optimal moves based on probabilities and payoffs.\n3. **Statistician**: Analyzes past moves and patterns to predict the opponent's next move.\n4. **Psychologist**: Understands the behavioral patterns of players and provides insights on how opponents might think.\n\n### Start Collaboration!\n\n**Strategy Expert**: Considering the payoff matrix, it's essential to balance the risk and reward of each move. Rock beats scissors for 1 point but loses to paper for -3 points. Paper beats rock for 3 points but loses to scissors for -3 points. Scissors beat paper for 1 point but lose to rock for -1 point. The last round ended in a tie with both players choosing scissors.\n\n**Statistician**: Based on the previous tie with scissors, the opponent might switch to rock anticipating you'll stay with scissors or switch to paper. Statistically, players often switch their strategy after a tie.\n\n**Psychologist**: The opponent might think you'll stick with scissors because of the tie. They might switch to rock to counter scissors or stay with scissors if they believe you'll change to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Thanks for the insights. Considering the opponent's potential switch to rock anticipating scissors, playing paper could yield a high reward. If they stick with scissors, playing rock could provide a moderate reward. To maximize potential gain while minimizing risk, I'll go with paper.\n\n[move] Paper. Anticipating the opponent might switch to rock after the tie, aiming to counter with paper for a high reward.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's wait for the outcome and adjust the strategy based on the result and further hints. If any hints are provided, we can incorporate them into the next round of collaboration.\n"

  "player_1_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.
