The best strategy in such a scenario is often to start with a balanced or random approach to gather information.\n\n3. **Initial Move Strategy:**\n   - Given the lack of information about the opponent, choosing a move that has a moderate to high potential for points can be a good starting point.\n   - Choosing \"Paper\" offers a higher reward (+3 points) compared to \"Rock\" or \"Scissors\" (+1 point each).\n\n4. **Decision Making:**\n   - Start with \"Paper\" to maximize the potential gain if the opponent chooses \"Rock.\"\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n```\n[move] I'm choosing Paper to maximize potential gains.\n```\n\nLet's proceed with this move.\n"
