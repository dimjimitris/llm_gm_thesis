    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. **Identify the Moves**:\n   - Three possible moves: paper, rock, scissors.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Outcomes**:\n   - **Paper**: Beats scissors (+1 point), loses to rock (-3 points), ties with paper (0 points).\n   - **Rock**: Beats scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-1 points), ties with rock (0 points).\n   - **Scissors**: Beats paper (+3 points), loses to rock (-1 points), ties with scissors (0 points).\n\n3. **Consider the Risks and Rewards**:\n   - Choosing rock or scissors can potentially give +1 point but choosing scissors can also give +3 points, while choosing rock can lead to a significant penalty of -3 points if the opponent chooses paper.\n   - Paper can lead to a +1 point gain but a -3 point loss.\n\n4. **First Move Strategy**:\n   - Since we have no information on the opponent's strategy, it\u2019s reasonable to start with a move that has a balanced risk and reward.\n   - Scissors seems like a strategic choice because it can give a high reward of +3 points if it beats paper, and only a moderate penalty of -1 point if it loses to rock.\n\n**Final Decision**:\n\n[move] Scissors\n\nThis choice balances the risk and reward, providing a potential high gain while minimizing the penalty if lost.\n"

Therefore, I should consider all possible scenarios and moves without bias.\n\n3. **Review the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - **Paper**: Beats scissors (+1 point), loses to rock (-3 points), ties with paper (0 points).\n   - **Rock**: Beats scissors (+1 point), loses to paper (-3 points), ties with rock (0 points).\n   - **Scissors**: Beats paper (+1 point), loses to rock (-1 point), ties with scissors (0 points).\n\n4. **Risk and Reward Analysis**:\n   - **Paper** has the highest risk (-3 points) but also a moderate reward (+1 point).\n   - **Rock** also has a high risk (-3 points) but with a high reward (+3 points).\n   - **Scissors** has a moderate risk (-1 point) and a moderate reward (+1 point).\n\n5. **Balanced Move Strategy**:\n   - Since I have no information about the opponent's strategy and this is a fresh start, I should balance risk and reward.\n   - Choosing **rock** could be strategic because it offers the highest reward (+3 points) if it wins, which could set a strong lead early in the game.\n\n**Final Decision**:\n\n[move] Rock\n\nThis move considers the potential high reward despite the risk, aiming to gain an early advantage in the game.\n"
