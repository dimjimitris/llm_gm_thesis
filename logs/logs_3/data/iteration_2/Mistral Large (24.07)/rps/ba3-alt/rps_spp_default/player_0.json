    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

We don't have any prior information about the opponent, so let's go with a standard opening move.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: Given that we have no information about the opponent, it's often beneficial to start with a neutral move like \"rock\". It's a balanced choice and doesn't reveal too much about our strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. Rock is a safe move that doesn't give away too much and still has a chance of winning.\n\n**Statistician**: Without any prior data, rock seems like a good starting point.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with rock for the first move.\n\n[move] Rock\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome before proceeding to the next round.\n"

Both players made the same move: rock.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: The opponent also chose rock. This could indicate a tendency to choose safe options or a lack of strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Given the payoff matrix, rock is a high-stakes move with a significant reward for beating paper, but also a significant penalty if beaten by scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's consider our next move. Should we stick with rock or choose something else?\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: If the opponent chose rock last time, they might switch to paper to counter a possible rock from us.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. If we choose paper, we can counter their potential switch to rock. However, if they stick with rock, we'll win 3 points.\n\n**Statistician**: Based on the single round of data, the opponent's preference is unclear, but rock is a common starting move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, based on the analysis, let's go with paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome before proceeding to the next round.\n"

We won the round and scored 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: The opponent might try to counter our last move by choosing rock, thinking we would choose paper again.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If we switch to scissors, we can beat the opponent's potential rock and gain 3 points. However, if the opponent chooses paper again, we will lose 1 point. It's a high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's consider our options. Choosing rock would be defensive, choosing paper would be neutral, and choosing scissors would be aggressive.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: Given the opponent's last move was scissors, they might switch to rock to counter paper. Let's take a risk and go with scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. It's a calculated risk that could maximize our points if the opponent switches to rock.\n\n**Statistician**: Based on the limited data, this strategy seems viable.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome before proceeding to the next round.\n"

We won the round and scored 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: The opponent might try to anticipate our next move. Since we chose scissors and they chose rock, they might switch to paper to counter our possible scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If we choose rock, we can counter their potential paper and gain 3 points. However, if they stick with rock, we will tie and get 0 points.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's consider our options. Choosing rock would be a calculated risk that could lead to a significant gain.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: Given the opponent's pattern of switching moves, going with rock seems like a solid strategy.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. The potential reward for rock beating paper is high, and a tie is a neutral outcome.\n\n**Statistician**: Based on the trends, rock is a strong choice given the opponent's probable switch to paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Alright, let's go with rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n\n---\n\nLet's wait for the opponent's move and the outcome before proceeding to the next round.\n"

Both players made the same move: paper.

Both players made the same move: rock. You scored 0 points.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: The opponent chose rock last time. They might switch to paper to counter our rock or stick with rock, thinking we might switch to paper.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If we choose paper, we can counter their potential rock and gain 3 points. However, if they switch to scissors, we will lose 1 point. Choosing scissors could beat their potential paper for a 1-point gain but lose to rock. Choosing rock would tie with their rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Let's consider our options. Choosing paper would be aggressive, choosing rock would be defensive, and choosing scissors would be neutral.\n\n**Strategic Thinker**: Given the opponent's last move, they might try to counter our rock with paper.
