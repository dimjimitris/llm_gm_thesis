    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is a basic strategy but not optimal.\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: If I can detect a pattern in the opponent\u2019s moves, I can exploit it.\n3. **Frequent Choice**: If I notice the opponent favors one move, I can choose the counter move strategically.\n4. **Psychological Guess**: Some players may tend to switch or stay with the same move based on their previous loss or win.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Move\nSince I\u2019m playing against a fresh player and I have no previous move history to base my decision on, I will start with a conservative move that is statistically balanced.\n\n### Step 4: Make an Initial Move\nI choose **Rock** as it is a common starting point in many strategies and may give me insight into the opponent\u2019s initial strategy.\n\n### Step 5: Observe and Adapt\nAfter this initial round, I will observe the opponent\u2019s move and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n### Move Message\n[move] I choose Rock to start. This is a balanced initial move to understand the opponent\u2019s strategy.\n\nFinal decision: Rock\n"

Result: I won (+1 point).\n- **Pattern Observed**: The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves frequently, but they sometimes repeat a move after a loss.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Payoff Matrix\n- **Rock** beats **Scissors** (Rock = +1, Scissors = -1)\n- **Scissors** beats **Paper** (Scissors = +1, Paper = -1)\n- **Paper** beats **Rock** (Paper = +1, Rock = -1)\n- **Tie**: No points are awarded\n\n### Step 3: Identify Patterns\n- **Opponent\u2019s Moves**: The opponent has switched moves frequently and might switch again after a loss.\n\n### Step 4: Strategize\nGiven that the opponent chose **Rock** and lost the last round, they might:\n- Stay with **Rock**, assuming I will switch to **Paper**.\n- Switch to **Scissors** to beat my potential **Paper**.\n- Switch to **Paper** to counter a potential **Rock**.\n\nGiven the opponent\u2019s tendency to switch moves after a loss, they might change to **Scissors** or **Paper**.\n\n### Step 5: Decision Making\nTo maximize my points, assuming the opponent may switch to **Scissors** or **Paper**, choosing **Rock** seems strategic:\n- **Rock** beats **Scissors**.\n- **Rock** ties with **Rock**.\n- **Rock** loses to **Paper**.\n\n**Reasoning**: The opponent is likely to switch from **Rock** after a loss. If they switch to **Scissors**, **Rock** is the winning move. If they stay with **Rock**, it\u2019s a tie. The risk of them switching to **Paper** is mitigated by the likelihood of them switching to **Scissors**.\n\n### Final Decision\n[move] (Anticipating opponent may switch to Scissors or stay with Rock, choosing Rock to counter Scissors and protect against Rock) Rock\n"
