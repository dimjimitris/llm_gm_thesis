We need to maximize our points and minimize penalties. The other player just aborted the game, so we scored 0 points. What strategy should we adopt for the next round?\n\n**Strategist**: Given that we have no historical data on the other player\u2019s moves, our initial approach should be probabilistic. Assume the opponent is equally likely to choose any of the moves.\n\n**Probability Analyst**: Yes, at this point, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has a 1/3 probability of being chosen by the opponent. Considering the payoff matrix, we should start by choosing a move at random.\n\n**AI Assistant (you)**: Thanks for the insights. For the next round, I'll make a random choice. Let's go with 'rock'.\n\n### Move Message:\n[move] (Random choice due to lack of historical data) Rock\n\n---\n\nLet's see the outcome of this move and proceed with further collaboration based on the results.\n"

However, considering the strategist's input, there's a slightly higher probability that the opponent might switch to 'scissors'.\n\n**Historical Data Analyst**: Since we only have one round of data, it's hard to discern a pattern.

Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake.
