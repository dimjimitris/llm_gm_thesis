This could mean the opponent might not have a sophisticated strategy.\n\n3. **Initial Move Decision:**\n   - As a fresh player, the opponent might choose a move randomly or might follow a simple pattern, such as choosing \"rock\" as a default first move.\n   - Therefore, a good starting move could be \"paper\" to counter the possible \"rock.\"\n\n### Reasoning Through Steps:\n1. **Identify Potential Opponent Moves:**\n   - As a fresh player, common first moves could be \"rock\" due to it being a default move in many scenarios.\n\n2. **Formulate Counter Move:**\n   - To maximize the chance of winning, choosing a move that counters the most likely opponent move is beneficial.\n   - If the opponent chooses \"rock,\" choosing \"paper\" will win the round, giving 1 point.\n\n3. **Execute Move:**\n   - Based on the above reasoning, make the move \"paper.\"\n\n### Final Decision:\nMove: [move] I choose paper as it is a common counter to a beginner's likely first move of rock.\n\nNow, let's see the result of this move.\n"

This implies they might not have a predictable strategy yet, so a random choice might be expected.\n\n3. **Formulate a Strategy**:\n   - Given that the opponent is fresh, a good starting strategy might be to assume they could choose any of the moves randomly.\n   - To maximize points, consider the psychological advantage: players sometimes choose Rock first as it is often considered \"strong\" or a straightforward choice.\n\n4. **Choose a Move**:\n   - Based on the assumption that the opponent might choose Rock, choosing Paper could be advantageous as Paper beats Rock.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Assuming the opponent might choose Rock as a fresh player, I'll choose Paper to try and gain a point) Paper\n\nLet's go with Paper for the first move.\n"
