    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's assume the opponent might play randomly.\n[move] Rock (An initial move to test the waters)\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** This is the first round, so there is no historical data yet.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Starting with rock is a good strategy, as it can beat scissors and tie with rock. If the opponent plays paper, we lose but will gain valuable insight.\n\n[After the move is made, observe the opponent's move and the outcome. Suppose the opponent plays paper.]\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent played paper. So, we lost the round.\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Opponent played paper in the first round.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Since the opponent played paper, they might try to switch to scissors to beat our rock if they think we will repeat our move. We should prepare for that.\n\n### Round 2\n**AI Assistant (you):** Based on the analysis, I'll play paper to counter a potential scissors move.\n[move] Paper (Anticipating the opponent might switch to scissors)\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Previous opponent move: paper. Our previous move: rock.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Good move. If the opponent plays scissors, we win. If they play rock, we tie. If they play paper again, we tie.\n\n[After the move is made, observe the opponent's move and the outcome. Suppose the opponent plays scissors.]\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent played scissors. We won this round.\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Opponent moves: paper, scissors. Our moves: rock, paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The opponent is following a pattern by switching moves. Let's anticipate their next move.\n\n### Round 3\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent might switch again; I'll play scissors to counter a potential rock move.\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating the opponent might switch to rock)\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Previous opponent moves: paper, scissors. Our previous moves: rock, paper.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Good strategy. If the opponent plays rock, we win. If they play scissors again, we tie. If they play paper, we lose.\n\n[After the move is made, observe the opponent's move and the outcome. Suppose the opponent plays rock.]\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent played rock. We won this round.\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Opponent moves: paper, scissors, rock. Our moves: rock, paper, scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** We have a pattern. The opponent is switching moves each time. We should continue to anticipate their moves based on this pattern.\n\n### Round 4\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent might switch back to paper; I'll play scissors again.\n[move] Scissors (Anticipating the opponent might switch to paper)\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Previous opponent moves: paper, scissors, rock. Our previous moves: rock, paper, scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** Good strategy. If the opponent plays paper, we win. If they play scissors, we tie. If they play rock, we lose.\n\n[After the move is made, observe the opponent's move and the outcome. Suppose the opponent plays paper.]\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** The opponent played paper. We won this round.\n\n**Historical Data Analyst:** Opponent moves: paper, scissors, rock, paper. Our moves: rock, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\n**Strategy Analyst:** The pattern holds. Let's continue using this strategy.\n\n### Continuing Rounds\nContinue this process, analyzing the opponent's moves and adjusting the strategy based on the historical data and pattern analysis provided by your personas. The collaboration will help in making informed decisions to maximize points and minimize penalties.\n"
