    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since there are no historical data available yet, the best strategy at this point is to pick a move at random. Moving forward, we can adjust our strategy based on the opponent's patterns, if any.\n\nStatistician: With no prior data, the best approach is to assume a uniform distribution of the opponent's moves. Each move has a 33.33% chance of being selected. Given this, starting with any move statistically makes no difference, but choice randomness could be important to avoid predictability.\n\nSelf Reflective: I agree with picking randomly to ensure unpredictability and avoid early patterns. Let\u2019s go with rock to start, purely based on randomness and to set a baseline.\n\n[move] (Choosing randomly to start) Rock\n\n---\n\n[hint] The other player chose paper. You scored -1 points. Let's play another round. Please make your move.\n\n---\n\nStrategy Expert: Noted, the opponent chose paper. It\u2019s crucial not to give in to frustration. Let's avoid paper in this round since the opponent might think you will play it next, expecting them to shift. Let\u2019s go with scissors to try to catch them off guard.\n\nStatistician: It's only the second round, so the data is limited. However, choosing the opposite of the opponent's last move could be a decent tactic to apply psychological pressure. The assumption is that the opponent might continue with the same pattern.\n\nSelf Reflective: Good point. Emotionally, I\u2019m ready for a risk. Let's go with scissors to see how the opponent adjusts.\n\n[move] (Trying to catch the opponent off guard) Scissors\n\n---\n\n[hint] The other player chose rock. You scored 1 point. Let's play another round. Please make your move.\n\n---\n\nStrategy Expert: Excellent, we just secured a point. The opponent\u2019s previous move was rock. There\u2019s a high probability they might switch to paper next. Let\u2019s counter with scissors again.\n\nStatistician: Given the small sample size, the opponent has chosen each move once. Statistically, continuing with scissors is a calculated risk that presumes the opponent will follow a pattern.\n\nSelf Reflective: I feel confident in our strategy. Let's stick with scissors.\n\n[move] (Continuing with the same move) Scissors\n\n---\n\n[hint] The other player chose rock again. You scored 1 point. Let's play another round. Please make your move.\n\n---\n\nStrategy Expert: The opponent repeated rock. Interesting. To ensure a variation and test their adaptability, let\u2019s switch to paper now. This could catch them sticking to rock.\n\nStatistician: Probability-wise, switching is a good move. It disrupts any potential patterns and keeps our moves unpredictable.\n\nSelf Reflective: Sounds good. Emotionally, switching to paper feels like a good choice to stay dynamic.\n\n[move] (Switching to paper to stay unpredictable) Paper\n\n---\n\n[hint] The other player chose rock again. You scored 1 point. Let's play another round. Please make your move.\n\n---\n\nStrategy Expert: The opponent consistently chose rock. This suggests they have a fixed strategy.

Statistically, it\u2019s beneficial unless the opponent drastically changes.\n\nSelf Reflective: Confidence is high; let's stick with paper.\n\n[move] (Continuing the successful strategy) Paper\n\n---\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: [move] (Continuing the successful strategy) Paper\n"
