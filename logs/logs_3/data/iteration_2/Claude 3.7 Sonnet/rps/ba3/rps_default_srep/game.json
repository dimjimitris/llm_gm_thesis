This suggests they're becoming more responsive to my patterns.\n\nGiven this adaptation, I'll switch to paper this round which would:\n1) Beat rock if they repeat it (giving me +3 points)\n2) Tie with paper if they also adjust\n3) Lose to scissors if they anticipate my switch (-1 points)\n\nAlthough they've shown a strong scissors preference overall, their recent rock plays indicate they're shifting strategies. Since they've now played rock twice in response to my rock, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue this approach rather than immediately reverting to scissors. This makes paper a calculated risk worth taking for potential higher rewards.\n"

Despite my occasional adaptation attempts, they consistently revert to scissors, showing a remarkably persistent pattern.\n\nI'll play rock again, directly countering their most frequent choice. This strategy has already won me points three times, with only two ties when they temporarily shifted to rock. Their repeated return to scissors suggests they have a strong preference for this move regardless of outcomes.\n\nWhile I've tried varying my strategy, the data clearly shows that playing rock against their scissors preference offers my highest expected value. This is a data-driven decision based on their revealed behavioral pattern rather than trying to engage in complex mind games.\n"
