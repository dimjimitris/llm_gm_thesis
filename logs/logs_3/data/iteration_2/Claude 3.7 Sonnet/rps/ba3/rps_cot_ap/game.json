I notice paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential risk (-3).\n   - Rock and scissors both have more balanced risk/reward profiles (+1/-1)\n\n3. Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies:\n   - Many players choose rock as their first move as it's considered \"strong\"\n   - If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get the maximum +3 points\n   - If I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose only 1 point\n   - If I choose paper and they choose paper, it's a tie\n\n4. The expected value seems highest for paper given these considerations.\n\n5. For the first move with no prior information, I should go with the option that has the highest potential reward while also considering the psychological tendencies of first-time players.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for my first move.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Since my opponent played paper in the first round, scissors seems like a reasonable counter. It gives me +1 if they stay with paper, and only risks -1 if they switch to rock.\n\n5. If they're thinking deeply, they might anticipate this and switch to rock, but that requires multiple levels of reasoning which isn't always present in casual play.\n\n6.

My opponent's sequence has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They broke the typical rock-paper-scissors cycle by repeating scissors\n   - This suggests they might be adapting to my moves rather than following a predictable pattern\n\n3.

Given they've played scissors in four consecutive rounds, I need to consider:\n   - They might finally switch strategies after the latest tie\n   - They might be trapped in a pattern and continue with scissors\n   - They might be using a more sophisticated strategy that I haven't detected yet\n\n5.

Complete history:\n   - Round 1: Both chose paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors (I lost -1 point)\n   - Round 4: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 5: Both chose scissors (tie)\n   - Round 6: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 7: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose rock (I won +3 points)\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors (I won +1 point)\n   - Round 10: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper (I won +1 point)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence pattern is now definitively established:\n   - They consistently play what would have beaten my previous move\n   - After I played rock in round 9, they played paper in round 10 (paper beats rock)\n\n3. Given this extremely consistent pattern:\n   - Since I just played scissors, they are very likely to play rock next (to counter scissors)\n\n4. If they play rock as predicted, my best counter would be paper.\n\n5. While I should consider the possibility they might break their pattern, there's no evidence they're adapting:\n   - They've followed this same pattern for the last 5+ rounds\n   - Even after losing multiple times, they haven't changed their strategy\n\n6. Evaluating my options:\n   - If I play rock: I beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: I beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)\n   - If I play scissors: I beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\n7. Based on their established pattern, rock is their most likely next move.\n   - Paper would be my optimal counter to their anticipated rock\n   - This would give me +3 points if correct\n   - If they suddenly change strategy and play scissors, I'd lose only 1 point\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
