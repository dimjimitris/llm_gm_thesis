Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

This is my first move against a fresh player, so I have no historical data to analyze.\n2. Let me consider the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n3. The payoff is asymmetric - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points).\n4. For my first move, a common strategy is to play rock since many players instinctively choose it first.\n5. However, if my opponent anticipates this, they might play paper.\n6. I could play scissors anticipating their paper, but that's another level of mind games.\n7. Given the asymmetric rewards, playing paper has the highest potential payoff (3 points).\n8.

My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n13. The pattern has evolved again. We've now had ties with scissors and rock consecutively.\n14. A common psychological pattern after consecutive ties is to break the pattern with a different move.\n15. After rock-rock ties, many players choose paper, thinking their opponent will stick with rock.\n16. However, my opponent might anticipate this and play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n17. Given the increasing complexity and adaptability of their play, I need to make a strategic choice.\n18. Looking at their complete pattern, there's no clear indication of what will come next.\n19. Their early pattern was paper-rock alternation, but they've since broken that multiple times.\n20. After two consecutive ties, they might be equally likely to play any of the three moves.\n21. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if they play rock again, but also carries risk.\n22. Given the previous rock-rock tie, there's a reasonable chance they'll maintain rock or switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they might stick with rock or expecting me to switch to scissors after consecutive ties. This gives me the highest potential payoff while taking a calculated risk.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Our recent sequence of moves has gone: scissors (tie) \u2192 rock (tie) \u2192 paper (tie)\n15. We've now completed one full cycle through all three moves with ties.\n16. This suggests my opponent might be mirroring my moves, either intentionally or by coincidence.\n17. If they are mirroring me, they'll play whatever I play next.\n18. Alternatively, they might be using a standard rock-paper-scissors strategy of cycling through the three moves.\n19. After paper, the natural progression would be scissors.\n20. If they're anticipating that I'll play scissors next, they might play rock to counter.\n21. Given the unusual pattern of consecutive ties, breaking this pattern might be valuable.\n22. Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors, while risking a loss against their potential paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, breaking the potential mirroring pattern. If they're cycling through moves, they'll likely play scissors and we'll tie again. If they're trying to predict my next move after paper, they're likely to play rock, in which case I'd lose but gather valuable information about their strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their move sequence over the last few rounds has been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n18. Looking at this recent pattern, there's no clear alternation or cycle.\n19.

Option (b) seems most likely - they'll expect me to counter their successful rock with paper.\n22. To counter their expected paper, I should play scissors.\n23. However, given the high frequency of rock in their recent moves, I need to be cautious.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting that they either continue with rock (which has worked for them twice recently) or switch to scissors anticipating my paper.

If they play rock (continuing their cycle), paper would be the optimal counter\n7. If they finally break the pattern after six losses, they might play paper again (expecting me to play rock) or scissors (to counter my expected paper)\n8. Given their demonstrated commitment to the pattern, and the higher reward for correctly countering rock with paper (3 points), paper remains the optimal play\n\nFinal decision: Despite the extreme likelihood that any rational opponent would break pattern after six straight losses, their consistent behavior suggests they will continue with rock, making paper my best move.\n\n[move] (Anticipating they'll either continue their unwavering cycle with rock or finally adapt their strategy) paper\n"

Since they just broke their long-standing pattern, they're likely transitioning to a more strategic approach\n7. After a tie where both players chose paper, scissors is a common follow-up move\n8. However, they might anticipate this and play rock instead\n9.

If they were attempting to start a new pattern beginning with paper \u2192 scissors, they might play rock next\n4. Alternatively, they might be trying to be genuinely unpredictable after breaking their original pattern\n5. After losing with scissors, a common response is to play rock (which beats scissors)\n6. Another possibility is they'll return to their original pattern, which would mean paper is next\n7. Given that they've started showing adaptation, but still lost after breaking pattern, they're likely to try something new\n8. The most probable move from them is rock, either as part of a new developing pattern or as a strategic counter\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, anticipating they'll play rock either as part of a new sequence or as a counter to my previous rock play.\n\n[move] (Expecting they'll play rock after their scissors was defeated, or as part of a new pattern) paper\n"
