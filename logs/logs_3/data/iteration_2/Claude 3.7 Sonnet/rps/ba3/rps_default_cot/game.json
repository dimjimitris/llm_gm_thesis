The payoff is asymmetric - paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points).\n4. For my first move, a common strategy is to play rock since many players instinctively choose it first.\n5. However, if my opponent anticipates this, they might play paper.\n6. I could play scissors anticipating their paper, but that's another level of mind games.\n7.

Round 12: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n13. My opponent's pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\n14. Our recent sequence of moves has gone: scissors (tie) \u2192 rock (tie) \u2192 paper (tie)\n15. We've now completed one full cycle through all three moves with ties.\n16. This suggests my opponent might be mirroring my moves, either intentionally or by coincidence.\n17. If they are mirroring me, they'll play whatever I play next.\n18. Alternatively, they might be using a standard rock-paper-scissors strategy of cycling through the three moves.\n19. After paper, the natural progression would be scissors.\n20. If they're anticipating that I'll play scissors next, they might play rock to counter.\n21. Given the unusual pattern of consecutive ties, breaking this pattern might be valuable.\n22. Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors, while risking a loss against their potential paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, breaking the potential mirroring pattern. If they're cycling through moves, they'll likely play scissors and we'll tie again. If they're trying to predict my next move after paper, they're likely to play rock, in which case I'd lose but gather valuable information about their strategy.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After the series of ties, they played rock which beat my scissors.\n16. This suggests they were not mirroring my moves but perhaps anticipating them.\n17. Their move sequence over the last few rounds has been: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n18. Looking at this recent pattern, there's no clear alternation or cycle.\n19. However, they've now played rock twice in the last three moves.\n20.

Option (b) seems most likely - they'll expect me to counter their successful rock with paper.\n22. To counter their expected paper, I should play scissors.\n23. However, given the high frequency of rock in their recent moves, I need to be cautious.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, expecting that they either continue with rock (which has worked for them twice recently) or switch to scissors anticipating my paper. While scissors might counter their potential paper play, the risk of encountering another rock (which has been frequent) is too high.\n\n[move] paper\n"
