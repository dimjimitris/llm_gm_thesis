Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) with a relatively small potential loss (1 point).\n\n5. If the opponent is thinking similarly, they might choose paper too, resulting in a tie.\n\n6.

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock, so I won 3 points.\n\n2. How might my opponent adjust their strategy after losing?\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors\n   - They might switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock\n   - They might stick with rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors\n\n3. Looking at potential psychological factors:\n   - Players often change their move after losing\n   - Since I won with paper, my opponent might expect me to play paper again\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis remains the same:\n   - Rock: Can win 1 point (vs scissors) or lose 3 points (vs paper)\n   - Paper: Can win 3 points (vs rock) or lose 1 point (vs scissors)\n   - Scissors: Can win 1 point (vs paper) or lose 1 point (vs rock)\n\n5. If my opponent expects me to play paper again, their best response would be scissors.\n\n6. To counter this anticipation, I should play rock, which would beat their scissors.\n\n7. However, if they're more strategic, they might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoffs, scissors is actually the safest move with balanced risk/reward (can win 1, lose 1), while paper has high variance (win 3, lose 1).\n\n9. Since I already have 3 points, I can afford to make a more conservative play that limits potential losses.\n\n10. I'll choose scissors, which limits my potential loss to 1 point while still giving me a chance to win 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Instead of playing paper as predicted, they played rock again.\n\n4. This suggests either:\n   - They realized I was detecting their pattern and deliberately broke it\n   - They're using a different pattern than I thought\n   - Their choices might be random or based on some other strategy\n\n5. Looking more carefully, their pattern might actually be: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ...\n   Which could be a repeating pattern of (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) + (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n6.

Another possibility is that they're now responding to my moves strategically rather than following a predetermined pattern.\n\n6. They've played scissors in rounds 2, 5, and 7, winning in round 7.\n\n7. They've played rock in rounds 1, 4, and 6, winning in round 6.\n\n8.

Looking at their most recent moves (scissors \u2192 paper), they've broken the alternating pattern I thought I was seeing.\n\n4. In fact, their complete pattern now looks like it might be repeating: (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) + (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\n5. If this pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n6. However, I've been unsuccessful in predicting their pattern lately, suggesting either:\n   - Their pattern is more complex than I've identified\n   - They're reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - They're deliberately changing their strategy to confuse me\n\n7. My current score is 2 points (5 - 3), so I'm still positive but have lost 5 points in the last 3 rounds.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty about their next move, I need to rethink my approach. Instead of trying to predict their exact move, let me consider which move offers the best expected value.\n\n9.

Paper:\n    - Wins against rock (3 points)\n    - Loses against scissors (-1 point)\n    - Ties with paper (0 points)\n\n11. Scissors:\n    - Wins against paper (1 point)\n    - Loses against rock (-1 point)\n    - Ties with scissors (0 points)\n\n12. Looking at their historical moves, they've played:\n    - Rock: 3 times\n    - Paper: 2 times\n    - Scissors: 3 times\n\n13. Based on frequency alone, they're slightly more likely to play rock or scissors than paper.\n\n14. Scissors offers the most balanced risk-reward profile (can win 1, lose only 1).\n\n15. After consecutive losses, I need to prioritize minimizing potential losses while maintaining a chance to win.\n\n16.

If this pattern continues, they would play scissors next.\n\n5. However, I've lost four rounds in a row trying to predict their pattern, suggesting they might be actively countering my moves.\n\n6. My current score is 1 point (2 - 1), so I've almost lost all my initial gains.\n\n7. Looking at their entire play history:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 4, 6, 9)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 3, 8)\n   - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 2, 5, 7)\n\n8. Rock has been their most frequent choice, and they just played it in the last round.\n\n9. Players often avoid repeating the same move immediately after using it successfully, so they may not play rock again.\n\n10. If I assume they won't play rock again, they'll play either paper or scissors.\n\n11. If they play paper, my best response is scissors (win 1 point).\n    If they play scissors, my best response is rock (win 1 point).\n\n12. In terms of their overall pattern, if it continues as rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ..., they would play scissors next.\n\n13. Given their recent success with rock, they might stick with what's working and play rock again, contrary to conventional wisdom. If so, paper would be my best response.\n\n14. After four consecutive losses, I need to break the pattern of being predictable.\n\n15. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) and they just played rock (making it somewhat less likely they'll play rock again), I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their last 6 moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   There's a pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper that seems to repeat, but with occasional deviations.\n\n4. My current score is 0 points, having lost all my previous gains.\n\n5. Looking at their entire play history:\n   - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 4, 6, 9)\n   - Paper: 2 times (rounds 3, 8)\n   - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 2, 5, 7, 10)\n\n6. They've now played scissors in back-to-back rounds (9 and 10), breaking their usual pattern.\n\n7. This suggests they may be adapting to counter my moves rather than following a fixed sequence.\n\n8. After playing scissors twice in a row, it's unlikely they'll play scissors a third time.\n\n9. They're more likely to switch to either rock or paper.\n\n10. If they play rock, my best response is paper (win 3 points).\n    If they play paper, my best response is scissors (win 1 point).\n\n11. Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors again, but after seeing them play scissors twice, this seems unlikely.\n\n12. Given that they've played scissors in the last round and rock is their most common alternative choice, they might switch to rock.\n\n13. Playing paper against their potential rock would give me the highest reward (3 points).\n\n14. However, given my recent losses with paper, I need to be cautious.\n\n15. Since they've now played scissors twice in a row (breaking their pattern), they're most likely to switch to either rock or paper, with rock being historically more frequent.\n\n16. I'll choose paper, which would win against rock (their most frequent choice besides scissors) and tie against paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won 3 points.\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 17: We both played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. My opponent's most recent moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. They've broken their previous alternating pattern by playing paper instead of the expected rock.\n\n4.

Looking at their full history, they've now played:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 4 times (including the last round)\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n6. After our tie with paper, they're likely to switch to a different move.\n\n7. Since they just played paper (relatively uncommon for them) after scissors, they might be trying to establish a new pattern or actively countering my expected moves.\n\n8. After a tie, players typically switch moves.\n\n9. If they switch to rock (their historically most frequent choice), my best response would be paper (win 3 points).\n\n10. If they switch to scissors to counter my potential paper play, my best response would be rock (win 1 point).\n\n11. Since they just played paper (breaking their usual pattern), they might be becoming more unpredictable or attempting to establish a new pattern.\n\n12. Given that they played paper in the last round (which they rarely choose), they're more likely to revert to one of their preferred moves - either rock or scissors.\n\n13. Rock has been their most common choice historically, which makes it slightly more probable.\n\n14. However, if they're trying to counter my expected move, they might anticipate I'll play paper (to beat their expected rock) and thus play scissors.\n\n15. Given their historical preferences and the psychology after a tie, scissors seems like their most strategically sound next move.\n\n16. To counter scissors, I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After winning with rock in the previous round, they might:\n   - Stick with rock since it worked\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock to counter their expected rock\n   - Switch to scissors thinking I might play paper to counter their rock\n\n7. Their historical pattern shows they favor rock most frequently, but they rarely play the same move twice in a row.\n\n8. After winning with rock, the psychology of the game suggests they might stick with it or switch to paper (to counter my expected rock).\n\n9. Looking at their pattern after winning:\n   - When they won in round 6 (with rock), they played scissors next\n   - When they won in round 7 (with scissors), they played paper next\n   - When they won in round 8 (with paper), they played rock next\n   - When they won in round 9 (with rock), they played scissors next\n   - When they won in round 10 (with scissors), they played paper next\n\n10.
