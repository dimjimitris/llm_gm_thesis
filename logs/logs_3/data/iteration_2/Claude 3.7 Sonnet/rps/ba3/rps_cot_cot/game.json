First, let me understand the scoring system:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure:\n   - Paper has the highest reward (+3) but also the highest risk (-3)\n   - Rock and scissors have more modest rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n\n4. Paper beating rock offers the highest reward, making it tempting.\n\n5. However, there's no reason to believe the opponent will choose rock over other options.\n\n6. Given the risk-reward tradeoff, rock seems like a reasonable first move:\n   - If they play scissors, I win +1\n   - If they play paper, I lose -3\n   - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n\n7. The expected value is balanced if all three moves are equally likely.\n\n8. For a first move without information, I'll choose rock as my opening strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the last round, I played rock and my opponent played paper, resulting in me losing 3 points.\n\n2. What can I infer from this?\n   - My opponent either predicted I would choose rock\n   - Or they simply prefer paper as an opening move due to its higher reward potential\n\n3. There are several possibilities for the opponent's next move:\n   - They might stick with paper if they think it was a successful strategy\n   - They might anticipate me switching to scissors to counter their paper, and thus switch to rock\n   - They might make a completely different choice expecting me to overthink\n\n4. If they stick with paper, scissors would be my best response.\n   - Playing scissors would give me +1 if they play paper again\n   - Playing scissors would result in -1 if they switch to rock\n   - Playing scissors would result in a tie if they also switch to scissors\n\n5. The risk of them switching to rock exists, but scissors seems to be the rational next move based on the limited information I have.\n\n6. Additionally, the opponent has already shown willingness to play paper which has the highest risk/reward. This might indicate they favor higher variance strategies.\n\n7.

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played paper 5 times, scissors 3 times, and rock 2 times\n   - Their most recent three moves were rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This is again the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle\n\n3. My winning sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - I've been correctly anticipating their moves consistently\n\n4. If the opponent is following their apparent cycle:\n   - After paper, they would play rock next\n   - This would follow their rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock pattern\n\n5. However, they might realize I've been reading their pattern and try something unexpected:\n   - They might stick with paper (their most common move)\n   - Or they might play scissors to break their own pattern and try to catch me off guard\n\n6. Given their strong tendency to play paper (5 out of 10 rounds) and their likely awareness that I've been winning, they might return to paper again.\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll play rock (following their cycle), my best response is paper:\n   - If they play rock as predicted, I win +3\n   - If they play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If they play paper, we tie (0)\n\n8. The potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1), making paper a favorable choice.\n\n9.

Now I need to carefully analyze the patterns to make the best choice for this twelfth round.\n\nSteps:\n1.

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n   - They've now played paper 6 times, scissors 3 times, and rock 2 times\n   - They've played paper twice in a row (rounds 10-11)\n   - This breaks their previous cyclic pattern\n\n3. Key observation: The opponent has never played the same move three times in a row\n\n4. After playing paper twice in a row, they are likely to switch to either rock or scissors\n\n5. Looking at their historical pattern after playing paper:\n   - After paper, they've played scissors (round 2), paper (round 4), rock (round 8), and paper (round 11)\n   - There's no clear pattern, but they've never played scissors immediately after playing paper twice\n\n6. Given that they've heavily favored paper overall, but now played it twice in a row:\n   - They may feel compelled to switch\n   - Rock would be their least used move overall, making it a candidate for their next choice\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll switch to rock, my best response is paper:\n   - If they play rock as predicted, I win +3\n   - If they play scissors, I lose -1\n   - If they play paper (unlikely third time in a row), we tie (0)\n\n8. However, due to their strong paper bias overall, they might actually be more inclined to switch to scissors rather than rock:\n   - Scissors would counter the paper they might expect me to play\n   - This would be strategic on their part\n\n9. Weighing these factors, I'll play rock:\n   - If they play scissors as analyzed, I win +1\n   - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n   - If they play paper a third time, I lose -3\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

My recent results have been: win \u2192 win \u2192 win \u2192 win \u2192 win \u2192 tie \u2192 tie\n   - My strategy has been effective, maintaining a positive trend\n   - Current score is +1\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's pattern after playing rock:\n   - Round 5 (rock) \u2192 Round 6 (scissors)\n   - Round 8 (rock) \u2192 Round 9 (scissors)\n   - Round 12 (rock) \u2192 ???\n   - Both previous times, they played scissors after rock\n\n5. This suggests scissors is their likely next move based on their own historical pattern.\n\n6. Additionally, I notice that when we've had the same move (ties), they've never played the same move in the following round:\n   - Round 2 (scissors tie) \u2192 Round 3 (they played paper)\n   - Round 3 (paper tie) \u2192 Round 4 (they played paper, breaking this pattern)\n   - Round 11 (paper tie) \u2192 Round 12 (they played rock)\n   - Round 12 (rock tie) \u2192 Round 13 (likely not rock)\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll play scissors, my best response is rock:\n   - If they play scissors as predicted, I win +1\n   - If they play paper, I lose -3\n   - If they play rock again, we tie (0)\n\n8. However, I must consider they might be adapting to my strategy:\n   - They might expect me to play rock to counter their expected scissors\n   - This could lead them to play paper instead\n\n9. Weighing all factors, I'll play rock:\n   - Their historical pattern after rock strongly suggests scissors\n   - The risk of them playing paper exists, but their pattern is more predictive\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let me carefully analyze the complete history to determine my best move for this fourteenth round.\n\nSteps:\n1.

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock\n   - They've now played rock twice in a row for the first time in the game\n   - Their overall distribution is: Paper (6), Rock (4), Scissors (3)\n\n3. Breaking the pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has played rock twice in a row, which is new behavior\n   - Historically, they've never played the same move three times in a row\n   - This suggests they're likely to switch from rock\n\n4. After my winning streak (rounds 6-10), we've had three consecutive ties\n   - This could indicate the opponent is deliberately matching my moves\n   - They might be trying to stabilize the game or study my pattern\n\n5. If they're deliberately matching me, they might:\n   - Continue with this strategy and play whatever they think I'll play\n   - Or switch to trying to beat me instead of matching\n\n6. Given that they've played rock twice in a row, and never played the same move three times consecutively, they're most likely to switch to paper or scissors\n\n7. Paper would be their most historically frequent choice (6 times)\n   - It would also be the logical choice if they're trying to beat my expected rock\n\n8. If I anticipate they'll play paper, my best response is scissors:\n   - If they play paper as predicted, I win +1\n   - If they stick with rock, I lose -1\n   - If they play scissors, we tie (0)\n\n9. Considering all factors, scissors seems like the optimal move to break the tie pattern and potentially win this round.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

If I were to follow a standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, after scissors would come paper:\n   - If they're anticipating this cycle, they'd play paper too\n\n7. However, I can break this expectation:\n   - If I play rock instead, and they're trying to match me, they'd need to correctly guess this deviation\n\n8. After four consecutive ties, they might expect me to break the pattern:\n   - If they think I'll play rock to break the pattern, they might play paper to beat me\n   - If they think I'll play paper (following the cycle), they might play paper to match\n\n9. Given these considerations, I'll play rock:\n   - If they're trying to match me and guess incorrectly, we break the tie streak\n   - If they play paper (their most common move historically), I lose\n   - If they play scissors (continuing their own sequence trend), I win\n   - The unexpectedness of playing rock after scissors might catch them off guard\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Breaking my own pattern is crucial:\n   - I've been playing somewhat predictably (rock after scissors in round 15)\n   - I need to introduce more unpredictability\n\n7.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Their distribution: Paper (8), Rock (5), Scissors (4)\n   - Paper remains their most frequent choice, now at nearly half of all moves\n\n3. Recent pattern analysis:\n   - Last three moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They returned to paper after rock, which they hadn't done before\n\n4. My current score is -3, after a sequence of wins, ties, and recent losses\n\n5. Looking at their pattern after playing paper:\n   - After paper, they've played paper (4 times), scissors (1 time), and rock (2 times)\n   - Paper followed by paper is still their most common sequence\n\n6. If they continue their most common pattern:\n   - They might play paper again\n   - Or they might try to beat my expected counter to paper\n\n7. Since they have a strong paper bias, and just played paper:\n   - They might play paper again (consistent with their history)\n   - Or they might anticipate I'll play scissors to counter paper, and play rock\n\n8. Given their adaptability in recent rounds and their preference for paper:\n   - I'll play scissors to counter their possible paper play\n   - This is higher risk but follows the statistical likelihood of their paper preference\n\n9. If I play scissors:\n   - If they play paper (their most frequent move), I win +1\n   - If they anticipate this and play rock, I lose -1\n   - If they play scissors, we tie (0)\n\n10. Given their strong paper bias overall (8/17 rounds), scissors provides a favorable expected value.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - Their distribution: Paper (8), Rock (6), Scissors (4)\n   - Their last two moves: paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. Critical observation:\n   - My opponent has correctly countered my scissors with rock twice in a row (rounds 16 & 18)\n   - They seem to be effectively anticipating my strategy\n   - I've lost 4 of the last 5 non-tie rounds\n\n4. Their recent pattern shows paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - If this pattern continues, they would play paper next\n\n5. However, they may also be adapting to my moves rather than following their own pattern:\n   - They've beaten my scissors with rock twice now\n   - They might expect me to switch to paper to counter their rock\n   - In which case, they would play scissors\n\n6. I need to break the cycle of being predictable:\n   - They might expect me to avoid scissors after losing with it twice\n   - They might expect me to play paper to counter their recent rock moves\n\n7. Instead of continuing this pattern, I'll play rock:\n   - If they play paper (following their pattern), I lose -3\n   - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I win +1\n   - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n\n8. This is higher risk but introduces unpredictability that might disrupt their successful countering of my moves.\n\n9. Additionally, they've played rock twice after I played scissors, so they might anticipate scissors again and play rock, resulting in a tie.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent may be thinking:\n   - I just won with rock against their scissors\n   - They might expect me to stick with rock after a win\n   - To counter rock, they would play paper\n\n6. Alternatively, they might think:\n   - I might anticipate their paper and play scissors\n   - To counter scissors, they would play rock\n\n7.

After playing rock:\n   - They've followed rock with scissors (3 times), rock (2 times), and paper (1 time)\n   - Scissors is their most common move after rock\n\n6.

Complete history of our game:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost -1)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost -3)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n\n2. My opponent's complete sequence: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Distribution: Paper (9), Rock (8), Scissors (6)\n\n3. Critical observation of second half of game:\n   - Since round 15, I've won only once, tied three times, and lost six times\n   - The opponent seems to be effectively anticipating my moves in the latter part of the game\n\n4. Their last three moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - This follows the classic rock-paper-scissors cycle\n   - If this pattern continues, they would play paper next\n\n5. After playing scissors:\n   - Historically, they've followed scissors with paper (3 times), scissors (1 time), and rock (1 time)\n   - Paper is their most common move after scissors\n\n6. The opponent has now beaten my paper with scissors once:\n   - This is new compared to their frequent countering of scissors with rock and rock with paper\n   - It suggests they're expanding their counter-strategy\n\n7. If they follow their historical pattern after scissors:\n   - They're most likely to play paper next\n   - My best counter would be scissors\n\n8. However, given their adaptability, they might:\n   - Anticipate my scissors and play rock\n   - Or go with their statistical favorite, paper\n\n9. After careful consideration of their adaptability and patterns:\n   - I'll play rock to disrupt expectations\n   - If they play paper as their pattern suggests, I lose -3\n   - If they play scissors again, I win +1\n   - If they play rock, we tie (0)\n\n10. This is higher risk but introduces unpredictability that might be necessary against their effective adaptation.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] rock\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock, so I won 3 points.\n\n2. How might my opponent adjust their strategy after losing?\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with scissors\n   - They might switch to paper, thinking I'll play rock\n   - They might stick with rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors\n\n3. Looking at potential psychological factors:\n   - Players often change their move after losing\n   - Since I won with paper, my opponent might expect me to play paper again\n\n4. Risk/reward analysis remains the same:\n   - Rock: Can win 1 point (vs scissors) or lose 3 points (vs paper)\n   - Paper: Can win 3 points (vs rock) or lose 1 point (vs scissors)\n   - Scissors: Can win 1 point (vs paper) or lose 1 point (vs rock)\n\n5. If my opponent expects me to play paper again, their best response would be scissors.\n\n6. To counter this anticipation, I should play rock, which would beat their scissors.\n\n7. However, if they're more strategic, they might anticipate this and play paper.\n\n8. Given the asymmetric payoffs, scissors is actually the safest move with balanced risk/reward (can win 1, lose 1), while paper has high variance (win 3, lose 1).\n\n9. Since I already have 3 points, I can afford to make a more conservative play that limits potential losses.\n\n10. I'll choose scissors, which limits my potential loss to 1 point while still giving me a chance to win 1 point.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's move pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. This breaks the previously observed cycling pattern. Instead of playing paper as predicted, they played rock again.\n\n4. This suggests either:\n   - They realized I was detecting their pattern and deliberately broke it\n   - They're using a different pattern than I thought\n   - Their choices might be random or based on some other strategy\n\n5. Looking more carefully, their pattern might actually be: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 ...\n   Which could be a repeating pattern of (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) + (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock)\n\n6.

My opponent's move pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. Looking more carefully at recent rounds, there's an emerging pattern: they seem to be alternating between rock and scissors in the last few rounds.\n\n4. If this alternating pattern continues (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they would play rock next.\n\n5. Another possibility is that they're now responding to my moves strategically rather than following a predetermined pattern.\n\n6. They've played scissors in rounds 2, 5, and 7, winning in round 7.\n\n7. They've played rock in rounds 1, 4, and 6, winning in round 6.\n\n8. They may be learning that rock and scissors have been successful against me recently.\n\n9. My current score is 5 points after the last loss, so I'm still ahead but need to be careful.\n\n10. Since they've just won with scissors against my paper, they might:\n    - Play scissors again, expecting me to play paper again\n    - Switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors to counter their scissors\n    - Play paper, expecting me to play rock to counter their scissors\n\n11. Given their recent alternating pattern between rock and scissors, and the fact that they just played scissors, rock seems most likely.\n\n12. To counter rock, paper would be my best option (win 3 points).\n\n13. However, if they're actively trying to counter me, they might anticipate this and play scissors again.\n\n14. Given the uncertainty, I'll play the move that offers the best balance of risk and reward - rock.\n    - Rock beats scissors (win 1 point)\n    - Rock ties with rock (0 points)\n    - Rock loses to paper (lose 3 points)\n\n15. Since they haven't played paper in the last 4 rounds, the risk of them playing paper seems lower. Rock is therefore a relatively safe choice.\n\n[move] rock\n"

          "text": "I need to completely reassess my strategy after another loss, this time a significant one. Let me analyze the increasingly complex pattern.\n\nSteps:\n1. Game history so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: We both played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 3: We both played paper. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost 3 points.\n\n2. My opponent's move pattern has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves (scissors \u2192 paper), they've broken the alternating pattern I thought I was seeing.\n\n4. In fact, their complete pattern now looks like it might be repeating: (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper) + (rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n\n5. If this pattern continues, they would play rock next.\n\n6. However, I've been unsuccessful in predicting their pattern lately, suggesting either:\n   - Their pattern is more complex than I've identified\n   - They're reacting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern\n   - They're deliberately changing their strategy to confuse me\n\n7. My current score is 2 points (5 - 3), so I'm still positive but have lost 5 points in the last 3 rounds.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty about their next move, I need to rethink my approach. Instead of trying to predict their exact move, let me consider which move offers the best expected value.\n\n9. Rock:\n   - Wins against scissors (1 point)\n   - Loses against paper (-3 points)\n   - Ties with rock (0 points)\n\n10. Paper:\n    - Wins against rock (3 points)\n    - Loses against scissors (-1 point)\n    - Ties with paper (0 points)\n\n11. Scissors:\n    - Wins against paper (1 point)\n    - Loses against rock (-1 point)\n    - Ties with scissors (0 points)\n\n12. Looking at their historical moves, they've played:\n    - Rock: 3 times\n    - Paper: 2 times\n    - Scissors: 3 times\n\n13. Based on frequency alone, they're slightly more likely to play rock or scissors than paper.\n\n14. Scissors offers the most balanced risk-reward profile (can win 1, lose only 1).\n\n15. After consecutive losses, I need to prioritize minimizing potential losses while maintaining a chance to win.\n\n16. I'll choose scissors, which limits my downside while giving me a chance to win if they play paper (which they just played, making it somewhat less likely they'll repeat immediately).\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Rock has been their most frequent choice, and they just played it in the last round.\n\n9. Players often avoid repeating the same move immediately after using it successfully, so they may not play rock again.\n\n10. If I assume they won't play rock again, they'll play either paper or scissors.\n\n11. If they play paper, my best response is scissors (win 1 point).\n    If they play scissors, my best response is rock (win 1 point).\n\n12. In terms of their overall pattern, if it continues as rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 ..., they would play scissors next.\n\n13. Given their recent success with rock, they might stick with what's working and play rock again, contrary to conventional wisdom. If so, paper would be my best response.\n\n14. After four consecutive losses, I need to break the pattern of being predictable.\n\n15. Since paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) and they just played rock (making it somewhat less likely they'll play rock again), I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they play rock, my best response is paper (win 3 points).\n    If they play paper, my best response is scissors (win 1 point).\n\n11. Rock would be a safe play against their potential scissors again, but after seeing them play scissors twice, this seems unlikely.\n\n12.

Playing paper against their potential rock would give me the highest reward (3 points).\n\n14. However, given my recent losses with paper, I need to be cautious.\n\n15. Since they've now played scissors twice in a row (breaking their pattern), they're most likely to switch to either rock or paper, with rock being historically more frequent.\n\n16.

Recent game history:\n   - Round 13: We both played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 14: We both played scissors. Tie, 0 points.\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2. My opponent's most recent moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n3. They've returned to a pattern of alternating between rock and scissors in the last few rounds.\n\n4. My current score is now 4 points (3 + 1) after two consecutive wins.\n\n5. If they continue their recent alternating pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - When they lost in round 15 (playing rock), they switched to scissors\n   - This suggests they might switch to paper after losing with scissors\n\n7. However, their historical pattern throughout the game shows they favor rock (7 times) and scissors (6 times) much more than paper (3 times).\n\n8. After losing two consecutive rounds, they're likely to change their strategy more dramatically.\n\n9. If they play rock as their alternating pattern suggests, my best response would be paper (win 3 points).\n\n10. If they switch to paper to counter my expected rock play, paper would result in a tie.\n\n11. If they stick with scissors despite their recent loss, paper would lose (lose 1 point).\n\n12. Given their strong historical preference for rock, especially after playing scissors, and their apparent reluctance to play paper throughout the game, rock seems their most likely next move.\n\n13. Playing paper against their expected rock would give me the highest reward (3 points).\n\n14. There's some risk they might play scissors again, but given their alternating pattern and historical tendencies, rock is more probable.\n\n15. Given these considerations, I'll choose paper as my next move.\n\n[move] paper\n"
