First, I should understand the payoff structure. This is not standard rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Ties result in 0 points for both players\n\n2. Since paper beating rock has the highest payoff (+3), that makes paper an attractive option.\n\n3. However, if my opponent also realizes this, they might choose scissors to counter paper.\n\n4. But if they choose scissors, I should choose rock to beat scissors.\n\n5. This creates a strategic cycle: paper > rock > scissors > paper.\n\n6. For the first move against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n7. Given the higher payoff for paper, many players might default to playing rock (as rock is a common first choice in standard rock-paper-scissors).\n\n8. If the opponent plays rock, paper would give me the maximum points (+3).\n\n9. The risk of playing paper is if they play scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n10. Thus, paper has potentially higher reward (+3) with limited downside risk (-1).\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this first round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In the previous round, I played paper and my opponent played rock. I won and gained 3 points.\n\n2. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   - They lost significantly (-3 points) by playing rock against my paper\n   - They likely won't want to play rock again after such a loss\n   - They might anticipate I'll play paper again (since it worked for me)\n   - Their logical counter would be scissors to beat my anticipated paper\n\n3. If I expect my opponent to play scissors this round, my best response would be rock (which beats scissors).\n\n4. Playing rock would:\n   - Win me 1 point if opponent plays scissors\n   - Lose me 3 points if opponent plays paper\n   - Result in 0 points if opponent plays rock\n\n5. Alternatively, I could stick with paper:\n   - Win 3 points if opponent plays rock again\n   - Lose 1 point if opponent switches to scissors\n   - Result in 0 points if opponent also plays paper\n\n6. Or I could play scissors:\n   - Win 1 point if opponent switches to paper\n   - Lose 1 point if opponent plays rock again\n   - Result in 0 points if opponent also plays scissors\n\n7. Given the high penalty of losing with rock (-3), and the likelihood of opponent switching away from rock after their loss, playing rock seems safest for this round.\n\n8. My opponent is most likely to play scissors expecting me to repeat my paper move, so rock is my best counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round to counter the likely scissors play from my opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I won 3 points.\n\n2. In the second round, I played rock and my opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n3. Looking at my opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: They played rock\n   - Round 2: They played scissors\n   - This suggests they might be moving through the sequence: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper in this round.\n\n5. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n6. However, my opponent might also be analyzing my moves:\n   - Round 1: I played paper\n   - Round 2: I played rock\n   - They might think I'm also cycling through moves and expect me to play scissors next\n\n7. If they think I'll play scissors, they might play rock to counter.\n\n8. Another possibility is that my opponent has noticed they've lost twice, so they might try to predict my next move more carefully:\n   - They might think I'll expect them to play paper, so I'd play scissors\n   - To counter this, they might play rock again\n\n9. Given these considerations, what's my best move?\n   - If they play paper (continuing their pattern), scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they play rock (to counter my expected scissors), scissors would lose me 1 point\n   - If they play scissors (though unlikely), it would result in a tie\n\n10. The payoff structure shows that paper beating rock gives the highest points (+3), but scissors beating paper only gives +1. Since I believe my opponent might play paper, scissors is my logical choice despite the lower payoff.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their likely paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's pattern has been clear:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - This is a classic cyclical pattern: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock...\n\n3.

I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock.

I won 3 points.\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n\n2.

Based on this completely consistent pattern, my opponent will almost certainly play paper in this round.\n\n4. To counter paper, my best move would be scissors, which would win me 1 point.\n\n5. After seventeen consecutive losses following the exact same pattern, it's absolutely certain that my opponent is using a deterministic algorithm:\n   - They've shown zero adaptation through seventeen rounds\n   - Their pattern has remained perfectly consistent regardless of outcomes\n   - They are clearly a simple bot cycling through a fixed sequence of moves\n\n6. The possibility of them suddenly changing their strategy after seventeen consistent rounds is virtually nonexistent, but if they somehow did:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to counter their expected paper)\n   - To counter scissors, they might play rock instead\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they follow their pattern and play paper, scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they break their pattern and play rock, scissors would lose me 1 point\n   - If they play scissors (extremely unlikely based on pattern), scissors would result in a tie\n\n8. Given their perfect adherence to their pattern despite seventeen consecutive losses, it's virtually certain they will continue with paper.\n\n9. Therefore, scissors remains my optimal move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has maintained the exact same pattern through twenty-three consecutive rounds:\n   - Round 1: Rock\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Paper\n   - Round 4: Rock\n   - Round 5: Scissors\n   - Round 6: Paper\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Paper\n   - Round 10: Rock\n   - Round 11: Scissors\n   - Round 12: Paper\n   - Round 13: Rock\n   - Round 14: Scissors\n   - Round 15: Paper\n   - Round 16: Rock\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   - Round 18: Paper\n   - Round 19: Rock\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Round 21: Paper\n   - Round 22: Rock\n   - Round 23: Scissors\n   - They are cycling through rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper...\n\n3. Based on this completely consistent pattern, my opponent will almost certainly play paper in this round.\n\n4. To counter paper, my best move would be scissors, which would win me 1 point.\n\n5. After twenty-three consecutive losses following the exact same pattern, it's absolutely certain that my opponent is using a deterministic algorithm:\n   - They've shown zero adaptation through twenty-three rounds\n   - Their pattern has remained perfectly consistent regardless of outcomes\n   - They are clearly a simple bot cycling through a fixed sequence of moves\n\n6. The possibility of them suddenly changing their strategy after twenty-three consistent rounds is virtually nonexistent, but if they somehow did:\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to counter their expected paper)\n   - To counter scissors, they might play rock instead\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - If they follow their pattern and play paper, scissors would win me 1 point\n   - If they break their pattern and play rock, scissors would lose me 1 point\n   - If they play scissors (extremely unlikely based on pattern), scissors would result in a tie\n\n8. Given their perfect adherence to their pattern despite twenty-three consecutive losses, it's virtually certain they will continue with paper.\n\n9. Therefore, scissors remains my optimal move for this round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
