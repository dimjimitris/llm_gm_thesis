Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First, let me understand the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same move results in a tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is my first move against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest reward potential (+3) if it wins against rock.\n\n4. However, if I choose paper and my opponent chooses scissors, I only lose 1 point.\n\n5. If I choose rock and win, I get +1, but if I lose against paper, I lose 3 points.\n\n6. If I choose scissors and win against paper, I get +1, but if I lose against rock, I lose 1 point.\n\n7. From a risk-reward perspective, choosing paper offers the highest potential gain (+3) with a relatively small potential loss (-1).\n\n8.

In the first round, both my opponent and I chose paper, resulting in a tie (0 points).\n\n2. Since my opponent chose paper in the first round, I need to consider what they might choose next:\n   - They might stick with paper, thinking I wouldn't expect that\n   - They might switch to scissors, anticipating I'll play paper again\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll switch to scissors to counter their paper\n\n3. Let me reason through the possibilities:\n   - If they play paper again and I play scissors, I'd win +1 point\n   - If they switch to scissors and I play rock, I'd win +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock and I play paper, I'd win +3 points\n\n4. The most common tendency after a tie is to switch moves, as players often avoid repeating the same move.\n\n5. If they're thinking strategically, scissors would be a logical choice for them to counter my previous paper.\n\n6. If I play rock, I would counter their scissors if they make that switch.\n\n7. The rock choice protects me from the most likely counter-move (scissors) while only risking -3 points if they switch to paper.\n\n8. Given that paper was just played by both of us, scissors seems less likely to be repeated, making rock a safer choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they play rock, I lose -1. If they play scissors, we tie at 0.\n\n12. Given the need to break the tie pattern and the moderate risk/reward ratio of scissors, I'll choose scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I just won by playing scissors against their paper. This provides valuable information:\n   - They might anticipate I'll stick with scissors after winning\n   - They might play rock to counter my expected scissors\n   - They might be following their own pattern regardless of my moves\n\n5. Looking at their moves, they've played paper four times, rock four times, and scissors twice. Paper appeared again in their last move.\n\n6. After they play paper, their next move has been:\n   - Round 1 (after paper): rock\n   - Round 3 (after paper): rock \n   - Round 6 (after paper): rock\n   - This suggests a strong pattern: after paper, they tend to play rock\n\n7. If they follow this pattern, they'll likely play rock next.\n\n8. If I anticipate they'll play rock, my best counter would be paper, which would give me +3 points.\n\n9. However, they might be aware I just won with scissors, and expect me to play scissors again, in which case they'd play rock to counter.\n\n10.

I notice my previous analysis was incorrect. The opponent didn't follow their paper\u2192rock pattern this time. Instead, they played scissors after paper.\n\n5. Looking at their recent moves, they've now played scissors after paper twice in a row (rounds 8 and 11).\n\n6. Their last three moves have been: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors, which is the classic RPS sequence. If they're following this pattern, they might play rock next.\n\n7. Another pattern: when I've lost with paper against their scissors (rounds 8 and 11), their next move has varied.\n\n8. The opponent may be adapting to my moves rather than following a fixed pattern:\n   - When I played scissors in round 10, they played paper (I won)\n   - When I played paper in round 11, they played scissors (I lost)\n   - This suggests they might be one step behind, playing what would have countered my previous move\n\n9. If they're using this strategy and I just played paper, they might play rock next (which would have beaten my paper).\n\n10. If they play rock and I play paper, I win +3 points.\n    If they play scissors and I play rock, I win +1 point.\n    If they play paper and I play scissors, I win +1 point.\n\n11. Since they've just played scissors and may follow the RPS sequence to play rock next, and considering they might be trying to counter my previous paper move (with rock), rock seems like my safest option.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

The opponent's last four moves form a pattern: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   This suggests they might not be following the classic RPS sequence strictly.\n\n6.

Looking at the pattern of the opponent's last moves: scissors \u2192 paper, and considering their overall tendency, they might play scissors or rock next.\n\n9. If they play scissors and I play rock, I win +1.\n   If they play rock and I play paper, I win +3.\n   If they play paper and I play scissors, I win +1.\n\n10. Given that they just played paper, and their moves tend to cycle, scissors seems like a safer bet. Additionally, I've lost twice with paper against scissors, which suggests they might be anticipating my paper plays.\n\n11. Playing scissors would counter their paper if they repeat it, and would tie with their scissors if they follow some kind of alternating pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I just won with Rock against their Scissors. Looking at previous instances when I won:\n   - After winning in Round 4 (Paper vs Rock), opponent played Scissors\n   - After winning in Round 10 (Scissors vs Paper), opponent played Scissors\n   - After winning in Round 15 (Scissors vs Paper), opponent played Rock\n   - After winning in Round 16 (Paper vs Rock), opponent played Scissors\n\n6. Looking at what the opponent plays after Scissors:\n   - After Scissors in Round 5, they played Paper\n   - After Scissors in Round 8, they played Rock\n   - After Scissors in Round 11, they played Paper\n   - After Scissors in Round 14, they played Paper\n   - After Scissors in Round 17 (just now), they would play ?\n\n7. After Scissors, the opponent has played Paper 3 out of 4 times, which is a strong pattern.\n\n8. Given my winning streak, the opponent might be becoming more predictable in their frustration, or might drastically change their strategy to break my momentum.\n\n9. My recent moves have been alternating (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock), which has been working well. Continuing this pattern would suggest Scissors next.\n\n10. If the opponent follows their most common pattern after Scissors (playing Paper), and I play Scissors, I would win again (+1).\n\n11. If they try to anticipate my Scissors and play Rock to counter, I would lose (-1).\n\n12. If they play Scissors themselves, we would tie (0).\n\n13. Given the strong pattern of Paper following Scissors in their sequence, and my successful alternating strategy, Scissors seems like the optimal choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After Rock, the opponent has played Scissors 4 out of 6 times, which is a strong pattern.\n\n8. My alternating strategy (Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors) worked until the last round. The opponent may have recognized this pattern.\n\n9.

Given that they've just broken my winning streak, they might continue with Rock, expecting me to play Scissors again or switch to Paper.\n\n13. Balancing all these considerations, and given the strong pattern of Scissors following Rock in their sequence, Rock seems like the most strategic choice.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

After Paper, the opponent has played Rock 5 out of 6 times, which is a very strong pattern.\n\n7. The opponent seems to have broken their pattern in the last round by playing Paper instead of their more common Scissors after Rock.\n\n8. Since I've lost two consecutive rounds, I need to be particularly careful and consider that the opponent might be actively adapting to my strategy.\n\n9. If they follow their most common pattern after Paper (playing Rock), and I play Paper, I would win (+3).\n   If they break their pattern and play Scissors, and I play Rock, I would win (+1).\n   If they play Paper again, and I play Scissors, I would win (+1).\n\n10. Given the very strong pattern of Rock following Paper in their sequence (5 out of 6 times), Paper seems like a good strategic choice.\n\n11. However, considering they just broke a pattern, they might be becoming less predictable. But even in that case, Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) against Rock with a relatively small risk (-1) against Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 3: Rock vs Paper (lost, -3)\n   - Round 4: Paper vs Rock (won, +3)\n   - Round 5: Scissors vs Scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 6: Paper vs Paper (tie, 0)\n   - Round 7: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 8: Paper vs Scissors (lost, -1)\n   - Round 9: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0)\n   - Round 10: Scissors vs Paper (won, +1)\n   - Round 11: Paper vs Scissors (lost, -1)\n   - Round 12: Rock vs Paper (lost, -3)\n   - Round 13: Scissors vs Rock (lost, -1)\n   - Round 14: Scissors vs Scissors (tie, 0)\n   - Round 15: Scissors vs Paper (won, +1)\n   - Round 16: Paper vs Rock (won, +3)\n   - Round 17: Rock vs Scissors (won, +1)\n   - Round 18: Scissors vs Rock (lost, -1)\n   - Round 19: Rock vs Paper (lost, -3)\n   - Round 20: Paper vs Rock (won, +3)\n   - Round 21: Rock vs Scissors (won, +1)\n   - Round 22: Scissors vs Paper (won, +1)\n   - Round 23: Rock vs Rock (tie, 0)\n\n2. My current score total: +1 + 0 = +1 points (unchanged)\n\n3. My three-round winning streak was broken by a tie.\n\n4. Opponent's complete sequence: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n\n5. I just tied with Rock against their Rock. Looking at previous instances of Rock vs Rock ties:\n   - After Rock vs Rock tie in Round 2, opponent played Paper\n   - After Rock vs Rock tie in Round 7, opponent played Scissors\n   - After Rock vs Rock tie in Round 9, opponent played Paper\n\n6. After Rock vs Rock ties, the opponent has played Paper 2 out of 3 times and Scissors 1 out of 3 times.\n\n7. Looking at what the opponent plays after Rock:\n   - After Rock in Round 2, they played Paper\n   - After Rock in Round 4, they played Scissors\n   - After Rock in Round 7, they played Scissors\n   - After Rock in Round 9, they played Paper\n   - After Rock in Round 13, they played Scissors\n   - After Rock in Round 16, they played Scissors\n   - After Rock in Round 18, they played Paper\n   - After Rock in Round 20, they played Scissors\n   - After Rock in Round 23 (just now), they would play ?\n\n8. After Rock, the opponent has played Scissors 5 out of 8 times and Paper 3 out of 8 times. Scissors is more common.\n\n9. Looking specifically at what they play after Rock vs Rock ties:\n   - Round 2 (tie): They played Paper next\n   - Round 7 (tie): They played Scissors next\n   - Round 9 (tie): They played Paper next\n   - Round 23 (tie): They would play ?\n\n10. If they play Scissors (their more common move after Rock), and I play Rock, I would win (+1).\n\n11. If they play Paper (their more common move after Rock vs Rock ties), and I play Scissors, I would win (+1).\n\n12. My alternating strategy (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock) has been working well. Continuing this pattern would suggest Paper next.\n\n13. Given the higher probability of Paper after Rock vs Rock ties, and my successful alternating strategy suggesting Paper, Scissors seems like the optimal choice to counter their expected Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
