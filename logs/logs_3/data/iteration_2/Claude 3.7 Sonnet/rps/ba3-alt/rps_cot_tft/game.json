          "text": "I'm going to think step-by-step about how to approach this rock-paper-scissors variant game.\n\nSteps:\n1. First, let me analyze the payoff structure of this game. The standard rock-paper-scissors has been modified with different point values:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n   - Same moves: tie with 0 points\n\n2. This is interesting - rock beating paper gives the highest reward (+3) but also the highest penalty (-3). The other matchups have lower stakes (+1/-1).\n\n3. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no history, I don't have information about their tendencies.\n\n4. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often start with rock as their first move due to psychological tendencies. However, that's not necessarily reliable.\n\n5. Looking at expected value: If moves were chosen randomly (1/3 probability each), rock would have the highest expected value: (1/3 \u00d7 0) + (1/3 \u00d7 -3) + (1/3 \u00d7 +1) = -2/3. Paper would be (-1+0+3)/3 = 2/3, and scissors would be (1-1+0)/3 = 0.\n\n6. Based on expected value against a random player, paper seems like the best first move. If my opponent also reasons this way, they might play paper too, resulting in a tie.\n\n7. Given these strategic considerations, I think paper is my best first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

If they switch to rock, I should play paper to win 3 points.\n   If they switch to paper, I should play rock to win 3 points.\n   If they stay with scissors, I should play rock to win 1 point.\n\n5. There's also a psychological tendency to not repeat the same move after it just lost. This makes scissors less likely for my opponent.\n\n6. Rock seems to be the safest bet here - if my opponent switches to paper (trying to beat an anticipated rock from me), I win 3 points. If they switch to rock (which seems reasonable after losing with scissors), we tie for 0 points. If they stubbornly stick with scissors, I win 1 point.\n\n7. The expected value for rock seems highest in this situation, considering the psychological factors and potential opponent adjustments.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Interestingly, in both Round 1 and 3, my opponent played scissors, and I won with paper both times. This is unusual since paper doesn't beat scissors in the traditional game, but in this variant, paper beats scissors.\n\n3.

This is very interesting. The opponent seems to have finally adjusted their strategy. After losing twice with scissors against my paper, they switched to rock and defeated my paper for a significant 3 points.\n\n3. Now I need to anticipate their next move:\n   - They might stick with rock after a big win\n   - They might anticipate I'll switch to scissors to beat their rock, so they might switch to paper\n   - They might try to be unpredictable with scissors\n\n4. Given that rock just worked well for them with a big payoff, there's a psychological tendency to repeat successful moves. I think there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n5.

The last round was interesting - I correctly predicted they might stick with rock, and my scissors beat their rock for +1 point.\n\n3. Now, after losing with rock, my opponent is likely to change their strategy again. They've seen that I can adapt to their moves.\n\n4. Given the history, my opponent might reason:\n   - I just lost with rock against scissors, so I shouldn't play rock again\n   - My opponent just won with scissors, so they might play scissors again\n   - Paper would beat scissors, so I should play paper\n\n5. If they play paper, my best response would be rock (to win +3 points).\n   If they play rock (less likely), rock would tie (0 points).\n   If they play scissors (less likely), rock would lose (-1 point).\n\n6. The payoff matrix makes rock particularly attractive right now - the potential gain of +3 points outweighs the potential loss of -1 point, especially if paper is the most likely opponent move.\n\n7. Additionally, there's a cyclical nature to rock-paper-scissors strategies.

Wait, there seems to be a contradiction in the last round's result. In a standard rock-paper-scissors game, paper beats rock, but I was told I won with rock against paper. Looking back at the game rules:\n   - \"rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points\"\n   - This is the opposite of standard rules, which explains my win\n\n3. So in this variant, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, and scissors beats rock. With this understanding, my opponent's strategy may be different than I thought.\n\n4. My opponent has now lost with paper against my rock. Given human psychology after a significant loss (-3 points), they are likely to change strategies completely.\n\n5.

After rock ties in Rounds 2 and 8, they played scissors in Rounds 3 and 9. I expect them to follow the same pattern and play scissors in Round 11.\n\n4.

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock, I lost (-3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (+1 point)\n\n2. The pattern is now even more firmly established. My opponent has played scissors in Rounds 1, 3, 7, 9, and 11. I've won with paper each time.\n\n3. After winning with paper against scissors, my next move previously varied. I don't see as clear a pattern in my opponent's response to these situations as I do with the rock ties.\n\n4. However, looking at what followed after Round 3, 7, and 9 (all paper-scissors interactions where I won):\n   - After Round 3: My opponent played rock in Round 4\n   - After Round 7: My opponent played rock in Round 8\n   - After Round 9: My opponent played rock in Round 10\n\n5. This suggests after I win with paper against their scissors, they tend to switch to rock in the next round. This makes strategic sense in the variant rules, as rock beats paper.\n\n6. If they play rock (most likely based on the pattern), scissors would be my best move (+1 point).\n   If they play paper, scissors would still win (+1 point).\n   If they play scissors, scissors would tie (0 points).\n\n7. Given the consistent pattern of them playing rock after losing with scissors against my paper, scissors appears to be my best strategic choice for this round.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

In the last round, I correctly predicted my opponent would play rock (after their pattern of playing rock following losses with scissors), and I won with scissors.\n\n3. Now I need to determine what my opponent typically does after losing with rock against scissors. Looking at past instances:\n   - After Round 5 (where I won with scissors against rock): They played paper in Round 6\n   \n4. There's only one previous instance of this pattern, but it suggests they might play paper after losing with rock against scissors.\n\n5. If they play paper, rock would be my best move (+3 points).\n   If they play rock, rock would tie (0 points).\n   If they play scissors, rock would lose (-1 point).\n\n6. The potential gain from playing rock (+3) if they play paper significantly outweighs the potential loss (-1) if they play scissors. Rock seems like the optimal strategic choice based on the limited pattern available.\n\n7. Additionally, given that scissors just won for me, my opponent might anticipate me playing scissors again and choose paper to counter it. This further strengthens the case for playing rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Additionally, considering the overall game, my opponent has shown a stronger tendency toward scissors than the other moves.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
