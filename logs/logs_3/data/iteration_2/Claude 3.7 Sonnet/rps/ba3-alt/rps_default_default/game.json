Their overall play now shows: 12 rocks, 7 papers, and 3 scissors.\n\nLooking at their pattern after playing rock, they have frequently either:\n1. Played rock again (multiple instances)\n2. Switched to paper (several instances)\n3. Rarely switched to scissors\n\nGiven they've just played rock and have shown a tendency to sometimes play rock multiple times consecutively:\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
