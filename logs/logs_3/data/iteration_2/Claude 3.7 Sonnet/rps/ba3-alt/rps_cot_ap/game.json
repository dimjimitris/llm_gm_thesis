Let me analyze the unusual payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Same moves result in a tie with 0 points for both\n\n2. The payoff structure is asymmetric - rock beating paper gives the highest reward (3 points), while the other winning combinations only give 1 point.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. I need to consider the expected value of each move:\n   - If I play rock: I win 3 points if opponent plays paper, lose 1 if they play scissors, tie if they play rock\n   - If I play paper: I win 1 point if opponent plays scissors, lose 3 if they play rock, tie if they play paper\n   - If I play scissors: I win 1 point if opponent plays rock, lose 1 if they play paper, tie if they play scissors\n\n5. Since rock has the highest potential reward (3 points), it's tempting to choose it. However, a rational opponent might anticipate this and play scissors.\n\n6. Paper seems to have the worst risk-reward ratio, as it can lose the maximum 3 points.\n\n7. For this first move, I'll choose rock since it offers the highest potential reward, and I have no prior information about my opponent's tendencies.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock in this first round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I need to be careful not to fall into predictable patterns. If my opponent is strategic, they might be trying to anticipate my next move based on my previous one.\n\n6. Since scissors beat my rock last time, a natural response would be to play paper. However, if my opponent anticipates this and plays rock, I'd lose 3 points.\n\n7. Instead, I'll play scissors. If my opponent plays scissors again, we tie. If they anticipate I'll switch to paper and play rock, my scissors would lose but only by 1 point. If they play paper, I win 1 point.\n\n8.

Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - My opponent played scissors in both rounds\n   - This suggests they might have a preference for scissors or are using a simple strategy\n\n4.

Given my opponent's consistent play of scissors so far, paper would be the logical counter, winning me 1 point if they continue with scissors.\n\n6. However, there's a risk my opponent anticipates this adjustment and switches to rock, which would cost me 3 points.\n\n7. My opponent might be trying to establish a pattern to trick me into playing paper, only to counter with rock for maximum points.\n\n8. Nevertheless, with two consecutive scissors plays from my opponent, the highest probability move from them is scissors again. Most players don't immediately jump to complex mind games in early rounds.\n\n9. The expected value of playing paper is positive if there's a higher probability they play scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round to counter the apparent scissors preference.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This is a very strong pattern that could indicate:\n   - A fixed strategy (always play scissors)\n   - Limited understanding of the game\n   - An attempt to establish a consistent pattern before breaking it\n\n3.

Given the clear pattern, the most logical move would be to play paper again, as it has worked in the previous round against scissors.\n\n5. However, three scissors in a row is such an obvious pattern that my opponent might finally switch tactics. If they're strategic, they might anticipate I'll play paper again and counter with rock.\n\n6. The risk of playing paper is high (potentially losing 3 points) compared to the reward (gaining 1 point).\n\n7.

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent played scissors three times, then rock six times, then paper once\n   - They finally broke their rock pattern after losing multiple times\n   - They successfully anticipated my scissors play and countered with paper\n\n3. Payoff structure reminder:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n4. Now my opponent has shown adaptability. Their possible next moves:\n   - Continue with paper since it just worked\n   - Return to rock if they think I'll switch to paper\n   - Switch to scissors if they think I'll play rock to counter their paper\n\n5. The most likely scenario is that they'll continue with paper after their successful counter. This suggests I should play rock.\n\n6. If my opponent plays:\n   - Paper again (most likely): my rock would win 3 points\n   - Rock (less likely): my rock would tie\n   - Scissors (possible but less likely): my rock would lose 1 point\n\n7. Playing rock gives me the highest potential gain (3 points) against their likely paper play, with moderate risk.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round to counter their likely continued paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

This is truly puzzling. I expected to win by playing rock against paper, but the result says I won 3 points with rock against paper. This suggests either:\n   - There was an error in reporting the outcome\n   - The payoff structure might be different than what I understood\n   - The opponent's move was misreported\n\n3. Let me reconsider the payoff structure I was given:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n4. According to this structure, rock does indeed beat paper (not the other way around as in standard rock-paper-scissors). So my understanding and the outcome are consistent.\n\n5. So my opponent played paper twice in a row, and lost significantly the second time.\n\n6. Their possible next moves:\n   - Switch to scissors to counter my expected rock\n   - Switch to rock to try something different\n   - Stick with paper despite the loss\n\n7. Given that they've lost substantially with paper, they're most likely to switch, probably to scissors which would beat my rock.\n\n8. If my opponent plays:\n   - Scissors (most likely): my paper would win 1 point\n   - Rock (possible): my paper would lose 3 points\n   - Paper (least likely): my paper would tie\n\n9. Playing scissors would be safe against their likely scissors (tie) or their possible rock (win), but would lose to the unlikely paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round, as it should counter their likely scissors play while avoiding the highest potential loss.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The risk of them finally switching to scissors after repeated losses is growing, but the reward for correctly predicting another paper play is substantial.\n\n9. I'll balance the risk-reward here. Playing scissors would protect against their scissors (tie) and win against rock, but lose to paper.\n\nFinal decision: This is a tough choice, but I'll play scissors this round, anticipating their potential switch to scissors or possible switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Payoff structure reminder:\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n5. Based on their established pattern of blocks, they're likely starting a new block of scissors plays.\n\n6. If my opponent plays:\n   - Scissors again (most likely): my paper would win 1 point\n   - Paper (unlikely): my paper would tie\n   - Rock (very unlikely): my paper would lose 3 points\n\n7. Given their demonstrated pattern of sticking with the same move for multiple rounds, paper is the logical choice to counter their likely scissors play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper this round to counter their expected scissors play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Updated pattern analysis:\n   - They have now played scissors three consecutive times\n   - Their previous pattern was:\n     - 3 scissors \u2192 6 rock \u2192 8 paper \u2192 now 3 scissors\n   - Based on their first cycle, they might continue with scissors or switch to rock soon\n\n3.

If they're strictly following their previous pattern, they might switch to rock after 3 scissors plays, which would match their first sequence of scissors.\n\n5. However, they've previously shown a tendency to extend their sequences (6 rock plays, then 8 paper plays), so they might continue with scissors.\n\n6. If my opponent plays:\n   - Scissors again (still likely): my paper would win 1 point\n   - Rock (increasingly possible): my paper would lose 3 points\n   - Paper (unlikely): my paper would tie\n\n7. Given that they've completed exactly 3 scissors plays (matching their first scissors sequence), there's a reasonable chance they'll switch to rock next.\n\n8. The risk of losing 3 points if they switch to rock now outweighs the potential gain of 1 point if they continue with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: Since they've completed exactly 3 scissors plays and might switch to rock (based on their first cycle pattern), I'll play scissors this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
