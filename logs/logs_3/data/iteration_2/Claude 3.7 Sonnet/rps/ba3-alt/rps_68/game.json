I need to analyze the payoff structure first:\n   - Rock beats paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Paper beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n\n2. Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, I need to make my first move without prior information.\n\n3. Looking at the payoffs, the highest reward comes from winning with rock (3 points), but rock is vulnerable to scissors.\n\n4. Paper might be a reasonable opening move because:\n   - If opponent plays rock, I win 1 point (they lose 1)\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point (they win 1)\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, so paper could be advantageous.\n\n6. The expected value calculation:\n   - If opponent chooses randomly (1/3 probability for each move):\n     - Paper: (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 0 expected points\n     - Rock: (1/3)\u00d70 + (1/3)\u00d73 + (1/3)\u00d7(-1) = 2/3 expected points\n     - Scissors: (1/3)\u00d7(-1) + (1/3)\u00d71 + (1/3)\u00d70 = 0 expected points\n\n7. Based on this expected value calculation, rock seems to offer the highest expected points if my opponent chooses randomly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock as my first move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Many players tend to switch their move after a tie, with paper being a common choice to beat the previous rock.\n\n5. If I expect my opponent to switch to paper, I should choose scissors.\n\n6. However, if my opponent anticipates this and chooses rock again, I would lose 1 point.\n\n7. Looking at the risk-reward ratio:\n   - If I choose scissors and my opponent chooses paper, I win 1 point\n   - If I choose scissors and my opponent chooses rock, I lose 1 point\n   - If I choose scissors and my opponent chooses scissors, it's a tie\n\n8. Alternatively, if I choose paper:\n   - Against rock, I win 1 point\n   - Against scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - Against paper, it's a tie\n\n9.

Looking at the pattern:\n   - Round 1: rock\n   - Round 2: scissors\n   \n5. Following the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle, the next logical move would be paper. However, my opponent might anticipate this.\n\n6. Let me consider my opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might expect me to choose paper next, following the cycle\n   - They might choose scissors to counter my expected paper\n   - Or they might try to break the pattern entirely with an unexpected move\n\n7. If my opponent expects me to play paper and chooses scissors, I would lose 1 point.\n\n8. However, if I break the pattern by choosing rock instead:\n   - If they choose scissors (expecting me to play paper), I win 3 points\n   - If they choose paper (breaking the pattern themselves), I lose 3 points\n   - If they choose rock (matching again), it's a tie\n\n9. The large payoff for winning with rock (3 points) makes it an attractive option if I believe my opponent will choose scissors.\n\n10. Given the two ties so far, there's a psychological tendency to break patterns. Since we've played rock and scissors, my opponent might expect paper next and prepare accordingly.\n\n11. Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points) if my prediction about my opponent choosing scissors is correct.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock to potentially counter my opponent's anticipated scissors move.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review what happened in the previous rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n\n2. This is interesting. In round 3, my opponent played scissors when I expected them to play scissors. I chose rock thinking I would counter their scissors, but I lost because they actually played scissors.\n\n3. There seems to be confusion in my understanding of the game rules. Let me re-examine:\n   - Rock beats scissors (not paper as I thought earlier)\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n\n4. Given the correct rules, if I played rock and my opponent played scissors in round 3, I should have won. The fact that I lost suggests I've misunderstood something or there was an error.\n\n5. Let me double-check the original payoff structure again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n6. Oh, I see. In this variant, the rules are reversed from traditional rock-paper-scissors! Scissors beats rock (not the other way around).\n\n7. Given this understanding, my opponent may be playing according to the correct rules while I was confused.\n\n8. For this round, I need to consider:\n   - If I play rock: I beat paper (3 points), lose to scissors (-1 point), tie with rock\n   - If I play paper: I beat scissors (1 point), lose to rock (-3 points), tie with paper\n   - If I play scissors: I beat rock (1 point), lose to paper (-1 point), tie with scissors\n\n9. Given that my opponent played scissors last round and won, they might stick with it or switch to paper expecting me to play rock again.\n\n10. Paper would be a good counter to scissors in this variant.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

In this variant of rock-paper-scissors:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n3. My opponent has chosen scissors in rounds 2, 3, and 4. This shows a strong preference for scissors.\n\n4. I won in round 4 by playing paper against scissors. My opponent might now:\n   - Continue with scissors (assuming my win was luck or expecting me to change)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my expected paper play)\n   - Switch to paper (to completely change strategy)\n\n5. If my opponent continues with scissors:\n   - Paper would win again (1 point)\n   - Rock would lose again (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n6.

Playing paper again might be risky if they switch to rock (I'd lose 3 points), but would win if they stick with scissors.\n\n10. Rock would tie against rock and win against paper (3 points), but lose against scissors (-1 point).\n\n11.

Let me review all rounds:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\n2. My opponent's pattern history:\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (7 occurrences)\n   - Paper: rounds 7, 10 (2 occurrences)\n   - Rock: round 1 (1 occurrence)\n\n3. Interestingly, my opponent has played paper twice now, both times when I played paper.\n\n4. It appears my opponent may be adapting to my strategy. After I won with paper in round 9, they switched to paper themselves to neutralize my strategy.\n\n5. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n6. Given that my opponent has shifted to paper on this round, they might:\n   - Continue with paper expecting me to play paper again\n   - Return to their dominant scissors strategy\n   - Try rock as a new approach\n\n7. If my opponent plays paper again:\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Rock would win (3 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n8. If my opponent returns to scissors:\n   - Paper would win (1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. The fact that they've adapted twice now with paper suggests they're actively countering my moves rather than following a fixed strategy.\n\n10. There's reasonable evidence to suggest they'll play paper again or switch to rock anticipating I'll play rock to counter their paper.\n\n11. Rock offers the highest potential gain (3 points) if they continue with paper.\n\n12. The cost of being wrong (-1 point if they play scissors) is outweighed by the potential gain.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent has returned to scissors after our paper-paper tie.\n\n4. This suggests a complex pattern:\n   - They predominantly play scissors\n   - They occasionally counter with paper when I've been winning with paper\n   - They quickly return to scissors\n\n5. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n6. I've now lost 4 times with rock against their scissors and won 3 times with paper against scissors.\n\n7. Their strong preference for scissors (8 out of 11 rounds) indicates this is likely their default strategy.\n\n8. If my opponent plays scissors again (which seems likely based on their pattern):\n   - Paper would win (1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n9. There's clear evidence that paper has been my most successful move against this opponent.\n\n10. While they occasionally adapt with paper, they've consistently returned to scissors afterward.\n\n11.

My opponent has played scissors in 9 out of 12 rounds, including the last round.\n\n4. Examining my results:\n   - When I play paper against their scissors, I win (rounds 4, 6, 9, 12)\n   - When I play rock against their scissors, I lose (rounds 3, 5, 8, 11)\n   - Paper against paper results in ties (rounds 7, 10)\n\n5. After I win with paper, my opponent either:\n   - Continues with scissors (rounds 5, 9, now possibly next)\n   - Switches to paper (round 7)\n\n6. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n7. Given that my opponent has played scissors after I won with paper twice (rounds 5 and 9), and maintained scissors in the most recent round, there's a good chance they'll continue with scissors.\n\n8.

The strong historical preference for scissors (9/12 rounds) suggests they're most likely to continue with scissors.\n\n12.

This is a critical development - my opponent has switched to rock after I consistently played paper against their scissors.\n\n4.

The risk if they return to scissors is moderate (-1 point), while the potential gain against rock is positive (1 point).\n\n11. This seems to be a critical juncture where my opponent has demonstrated they're actively adapting.

However, their dominant strategy remains scissors (10 out of 14 rounds), suggesting they may default to this.\n\n12. Given their pattern of adaptations and the immediate return to scissors, I think they're most likely to play paper next to counter my scissors.\n\n13.

My opponent has returned to a scissors-dominant strategy, playing scissors in the last two rounds.\n\n4. Their brief switch to rock in round 13 appears to have been a tactical move rather than a strategic shift.\n\n5.

While there's always a risk they'll switch to rock again to counter paper, the strong statistical evidence suggests they're most likely to play scissors.\n\n11. After their single deviation to rock in round 13, they've played scissors twice in succession.\n\n12.

Given that I've just won with paper, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their dominant strategy)\n   - Switch to paper (to tie against my expected paper)\n   - Switch to rock (to strongly counter my paper)\n\n8. Their most recent adaptation after I won with paper (round 12 to 13) was to switch to rock.\n\n9. However, they've also shown a strong tendency to return to scissors regardless of the outcome.\n\n10. If I expect them to switch to rock:\n   - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n   - Rock would tie (0 points)\n   - Scissors would win (1 point)\n\n11. The risk of them switching to rock is significant (-3 points), while the potential gain if they play scissors again is moderate (1 point).\n\n12.

After our scissors-scissors tie, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their dominant strategy)\n   - Switch to paper (to counter my potential scissors play again)\n   - Switch to rock (to mix up their strategy)\n\n8. Their strong preference for scissors and their tendency to return to scissors after brief deviations suggests they're most likely to continue with scissors.\n\n9. If my opponent plays scissors again:\n   - Paper would win (1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n10. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors and recent commitment to this strategy, paper appears to be the highest expected value play.\n\n11. The statistical evidence (13/17 rounds being scissors, including 4 in a row) strongly suggests scissors is their default strategy.\n\n12. While there's always a risk they'll suddenly adapt, their behavior pattern indicates this is less likely than them continuing with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (14 occurrences)\n   - Paper: rounds 7, 10 (2 occurrences)\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 13 (2 occurrences)\n\n3. My opponent has now played scissors in 14 out of 18 rounds (78%), including the last 5 consecutive rounds.\n\n4. This consistent scissors strategy persists even though I've won against it multiple times with paper.\n\n5. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n6. Looking at patterns after I win with paper:\n   - After round 4: they played scissors\n   - After round 6: they played paper\n   - After round 9: they played paper\n   - After round 12: they played rock\n   - After round 16: they played scissors\n   - Now after round 18: ?\n\n7. There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after I win with paper, but they have occasionally switched to counter my paper strategy (3 out of 5 times).\n\n8. After my win in round 16, they continued with scissors rather than adapting.\n\n9. Given that I've just won with paper, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with scissors (their dominant strategy)\n   - Switch to paper (to tie against my expected paper)\n   - Switch to rock (to strongly counter my paper)\n\n10. While they occasionally adapt after I win with paper, their overwhelming tendency is to play scissors.\n\n11. The statistical evidence suggests scissors is still their most likely move.\n\n12. However, their previous adaptation to rock after I won with paper in round 12 resulted in a significant point swing (-3 points for me).\n\n13. Given their pattern of occasionally adapting after consecutive paper wins, and the fact that I've now won twice in a row with paper, there's an increased risk they might adapt with rock.\n\n14. If I expect them to potentially switch to rock:\n    - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - Rock would tie (0 points)\n    - Scissors would win (1 point)\n\n15. The potential loss from playing paper against rock (-3 points) is significant, while the gain from scissors against rock is moderate (1 point).\n\n16. This seems like a critical juncture where adaptation is more likely than usual.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round to counter their potential switch to rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (14 occurrences)\n   - Paper: rounds 7, 10, 19 (3 occurrences)\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 13 (2 occurrences)\n\n3. My opponent has switched to paper in round 19, breaking their streak of 5 consecutive scissors plays.\n\n4. This confirms they are indeed adapting their strategy. After I won twice with paper, they correctly anticipated I might switch to scissors and countered with paper.\n\n5. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n6. Looking at their adaptation pattern:\n   - They predominantly play scissors\n   - They switched to paper after I won consecutive rounds with paper\n   - They previously switched to rock after I won with paper in round 12\n\n7. Given that they've just switched to paper, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Return to their dominant scissors strategy\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I might play paper to counter their paper\n\n8. If my opponent plays paper again:\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Rock would win (3 points)\n   - Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\n9. If my opponent returns to scissors:\n   - Paper would win (1 point)\n   - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n   - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n10. Since they've just demonstrated adaptability by correctly anticipating my scissors play, there's a good chance they're actively thinking about the next move.\n\n11. In previous cases where they've deviated from scissors, they've shown a tendency to return to scissors quickly rather than maintain the new strategy.\n\n12. However, since their paper strategy just succeeded, there's an increased chance they might continue with it.\n\n13. Rock would be the strongest counter to their potential paper play, with a high reward (3 points).\n\n14. The risk of them returning immediately to scissors (losing 1 point) is outweighed by the potential gain against paper (3 points).\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's updated pattern:\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (14 occurrences)\n   - Paper: rounds 7, 10, 19 (3 occurrences)\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 13, 20 (3 occurrences)\n\n3. This is the first time since round 1 that my opponent has played rock. After switching to paper in round 19, they've now switched to rock.\n\n4. This suggests my opponent is actively adapting their strategy in response to my moves, moving away from their scissors-dominant strategy.\n\n5. Their recent pattern shows increasing adaptability:\n   - Round 18: scissors (their dominant strategy)\n   - Round 19: paper (adapting to counter my expected scissors)\n   - Round 20: rock (adapting again, possibly anticipating my rock play)\n\n6. In this variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n   - Rock beats paper (winner: 3 points, loser: -3 points)\n   - Scissors beats rock (winner: 1 point, loser: -1 point)\n\n7. After our rock-rock tie, my opponent might:\n   - Continue with rock, expecting me to play rock again\n   - Switch to paper to counter my expected rock\n   - Return to scissors, their dominant strategy\n\n8. Given their recent adaptive behavior, there's a strong chance they'll switch to paper to counter my expected rock play.\n\n9. If my opponent plays paper:\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Rock would lose (-3 points)\n   - Scissors would win (1 point)\n\n10. If my opponent returns to scissors:\n    - Paper would win (1 point)\n    - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n    - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n11. If my opponent continues with rock:\n    - Paper would lose (-3 points)\n    - Rock would tie (0 points)\n    - Scissors would win (1 point)\n\n12. Given their demonstrated adaptability in the last few rounds and the fact that paper would be a logical counter to rock, scissors seems like the strongest play to counter their likely paper move.\n\n13. Scissors has the advantage of beating paper and only losing 1 point to scissors if they return to their dominant strategy.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

After recent ties, my opponent has shown different patterns:\n   - After rock-rock tie in round 20: they played scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 21: they played paper\n\n5. Looking at previous paper-paper ties:\n   - After round 7 tie: they played scissors\n   - After round 10 tie: they played scissors\n   - Now after round 22 tie: ?\n\n6.

After our paper-paper tie, my opponent might:\n   - Play scissors (consistent with their behavior after previous paper-paper ties)\n   - Continue with paper (to counter my potential scissors play)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential paper play)\n\n8. Their historical pattern strongly suggests they'll play scissors after a paper-paper tie.\n\n9. Additionally, scissors remains their dominant strategy overall.\n\n10.

Looking at their adaptation pattern after consecutive paper wins:\n   - After rounds 4 & 6 wins: they switched to paper in round 7\n   - After rounds 16 & 18 wins: they switched to paper in round 19\n\n9. This suggests that after I win twice in a row with paper, they tend to adapt by playing paper themselves.\n\n10. However, I've only won once with paper in this current sequence.\n\n11. Their most frequent response after a single paper win is to continue with scissors (3 out of 6 times).\n\n12. If my opponent plays scissors again:\n    - Paper would win (1 point)\n    - Rock would lose (-1 point)\n    - Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\n13. Paper has been consistently successful against their scissors strategy, winning 6 times now.\n\n14. While there's always a risk they'll adapt, the statistics suggest they're more likely to continue with scissors after a single paper win than to immediately adapt.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"
