Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point.\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points.\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point.\n   - Same moves result in no points for either player.\n\n2. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have data on their previous moves or strategy.\n\n3. Let me evaluate the expected value of each move:\n   - If I play rock: I win 3 points if they play paper, lose 1 if they play scissors, and 0 if they play rock.\n   - If I play paper: I win 1 point if they play scissors, lose 3 if they play rock, and 0 if they play paper.\n   - If I play scissors: I win 1 point if they play rock, lose 1 if they play paper, and 0 if they play scissors.\n\n4. Since I have no prior information on the opponent, I'll use the move that has the highest potential gain while considering potential losses. Rock has the highest potential gain (3 points), but also exposes me to losing 1 point. This seems like a reasonable risk-reward tradeoff.\n\n5. Since this is the first round, many players tend to choose rock as their first move. I could try to counter this with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper for the first round to see how the opponent responds.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I won and scored 1 point.\n\n2. Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the feedback. According to the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point.\n   - But if I played paper and my opponent played scissors, scissors should beat paper.\n   \n3. Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point\n   - Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point\n\n4. There seems to be a reversal in the rules provided. Based on traditional rock-paper-scissors, paper should beat rock, rock should beat scissors, and scissors should beat paper.\n\n5. Given the rules as stated, I'll assume scissors beat my paper and I should have lost, but was told I won. This suggests either:\n   - The payoff structure is inverted from traditional rock-paper-scissors\n   - There was a reporting error\n\n6. For this round, I'll adapt my strategy based on the information provided. My opponent played scissors last time. They might:\n   - Play scissors again if they think it was a good move\n   - Switch to rock or paper to try something different\n\n7. If I play rock, I could beat paper (if they switch) for 3 points, but lose to scissors (if they repeat) for -1 point.\n\n8. Given the uncertainty, I'll choose rock as it has the highest potential payoff and protects against a repeat scissors move by my opponent.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock this round.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
