I made a logical error in my previous analysis. If they played scissors and I played rock, I should have won, not lost. The game rules state that rock beats scissors. There must have been a miscommunication or error in the game results.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- Rock beats scissors (winner gets +1, loser gets -1)\n- Scissors beats paper (winner gets +1, loser gets -1)\n- Paper beats rock (winner gets +1, loser gets -1)\n\nActually, I think I misread the rules earlier. Let me reread them:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 points\n\nI see now - the rules in this version are reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors! Scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, and paper beats scissors.\n\nWith this corrected understanding, let me plan my next move:\n\nSteps:\n1. Using the correct rule interpretation (scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors):\n2. The opponent played scissors, beating my rock, which means my understanding of the winning combinations was incorrect.\n3. Given this new understanding, I'll revise my strategy accordingly.\n4. My opponent may expect me to play paper next to counter their scissors.\n5. If they expect me to play paper, they might play rock (which beats paper in these rules).\n6. To counter their anticipated rock, I should play scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Updated frequency of my opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n3. Their distribution is now perfectly balanced across all three moves.\n4. Their most recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n5. After winning with rock against my paper, they played paper and won against my scissors.\n6. This suggests they might be successfully predicting my moves and countering them.\n7. Looking at their overall pattern throughout the game, they seem to have shifted strategies multiple times:\n   - Early game: more random or matching\n   - Mid game: following patterns like playing what loses to my previous move\n   - Recent game: successfully countering my moves\n8. After winning with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Stay with paper (continuing with a winning move)\n   - Switch to rock (if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (if they think I'll play rock to counter their expected rock)\n9. Given their recent success with varying their moves unpredictably, and their now balanced distribution, predicting their next move is challenging.\n10. If I look at their longer-term pattern, they haven't played the same move three times in a row recently, so they're unlikely to play paper a third consecutive time.\n11. Between rock and scissors, they might favor rock given their recent success with it.\n12. To counter their anticipated rock play, I'll choose scissors (which beats rock in these reversed rules).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their most recent sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n5. They broke their pattern of consecutive paper plays by switching to scissors.\n6. After our scissors-scissors tie, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to switch to paper)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting me to stay with scissors)\n   - Stay with scissors (less likely given their tendency to switch after ties)\n7. In previous rounds after a tie, they've typically switched their move.\n8. Given they've used scissors most frequently overall, they might be less inclined to play scissors again immediately.\n9. Between rock and paper, both seem equally likely based on their overall distribution.\n10. Looking at their longer-term patterns, they've recently alternated between paper and another move (rock or scissors).\n11. Following this loose pattern, they might play rock after scissors.\n12. Given their adaptability and unpredictability shown in recent rounds, I need to be cautious in my prediction.\n13. To counter their anticipated rock play, I'll choose scissors again (which beats rock in these reversed rules).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
