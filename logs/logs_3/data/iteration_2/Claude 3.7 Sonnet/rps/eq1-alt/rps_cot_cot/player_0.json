Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

My opponent's moves:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 6 times\n\n5. My opponent broke their apparent pattern by playing paper instead of scissors.\n\n6. This suggests they are actively adapting to counter my strategy rather than following a fixed pattern.\n\n7. After playing paper and winning against my scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with paper, expecting me to play rock\n   - Switch to rock, expecting me to play scissors again\n   - Switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper\n\n8. Given their balanced but adaptive approach, they're likely to switch moves after a win.\n\n9. If they expect me to play rock to counter their paper, they might play scissors.\n\n10. However, they might also expect me to anticipate this and play paper, in which case they would play rock.\n\n11. Since they've shown the ability to adapt quickly and have just broken a pattern, I'll focus on countering their most likely next move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock for this round, anticipating they'll switch to scissors after their win with paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's moves:\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n\n5. My opponent now has a perfectly balanced distribution across all three options.\n\n6. They've won the last two rounds, suggesting they're successfully anticipating my moves.\n\n7. Their recent sequence has been: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   This matches the standard cyclic rotation in Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n8. If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next.\n\n9. To counter their expected rock move, I should play scissors.\n\n10. However, they might be aware I've noticed this pattern and break it, expecting me to play scissors.\n\n11. Given their success in the last two rounds and their demonstrated adaptability, I need to be cautious about assuming they'll follow a simple pattern.\n\n12. I'll counter their most likely next move based on the observed cyclic pattern, while acknowledging they might break it.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors for this round, anticipating they'll continue their cycle with rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their recent sequence has been: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   They're breaking the expected cyclic pattern to successfully counter my moves.\n\n7.

Given their success in breaking patterns and their slight preference for paper, I need a strategy that doesn't rely on pattern prediction.\n\n9. They've used paper in 2 of the last 3 rounds, suggesting they might switch to a different move.\n\n10. After three consecutive wins, they might become more confident in their ability to predict my moves and stick with what's been working (paper).\n\n11. I'll break my own pattern and play the move they've used least recently.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper for this round, which would tie with their paper or win against their rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"
