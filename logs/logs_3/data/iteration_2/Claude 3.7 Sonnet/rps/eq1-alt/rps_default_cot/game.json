However, research suggests that in the first round of rock-paper-scissors, people tend to choose rock more frequently.\n6. This slight psychological tendency could give paper a small theoretical advantage as a first move.\n7. Therefore, I'll choose paper for this first round, which would defeat rock if my opponent follows the common first-move tendency.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This confirms my understanding of the rules: scissors beats rock. I played scissors and they played rock, and I won.\n\n4. My opponent has played rock twice in a row now, which is interesting.\n\n5. They might:\n   - Play rock a third time if they're using a strategy of persistence\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I might play rock to counter their rock\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I might play paper to counter their rock\n\n6. Given that rock has worked well for them overall (they've won with it multiple times), they might continue with it.\n\n7. If they play rock again, scissors would win (as it just did).\n\n8. However, they might also anticipate that I'll play scissors again since it just won, and counter with paper.\n\n9. Since my most recent win was with scissors against rock, I'll stick with scissors again, as they may continue with rock or might overthink and make another move that scissors could beat.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper\n\n3. My opponent has now played paper twice in a row again. They've played paper a total of 10 times out of 20 rounds, showing a strong preference for this move.\n\n4. In fact, I've lost 5 times when playing scissors against their paper, showing that they may be anticipating when I'll play scissors.\n\n5. After playing paper twice in a row, they might:\n   - Continue with paper for a third time (as they've done before)\n   - Switch to scissors (traditional sequence)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential paper play)\n\n6. Given their strong preference for paper overall, there's a reasonable chance they'll play paper again.\n\n7. If they play paper again, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to rock, paper would win.\n   If they switch to scissors, paper would lose.\n\n8. Since they've shown a tendency to stick with paper for multiple rounds, and I've lost several times playing scissors against their paper, I'll play rock, which would beat their paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent seems to be very good at anticipating my moves. They switched from paper to scissors just as I switched to rock.\n\n4. Overall review:\n   - My record: 3 wins, 14 losses, 4 ties\n   - I've noticed they're particularly good at anticipating when I'll play scissors or rock\n\n5. After playing scissors, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (persistence)\n   - Switch to paper (traditional sequence)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential scissors play)\n\n6. Given their ability to predict my moves, I need to be less predictable.\n\n7. Since they just played scissors, the standard response would be to play paper.\n   However, they might anticipate this and play rock to counter.\n\n8. Let me try to break my own patterns. I'll play scissors, which would lose to their potential rock but win against their potential paper.\n\n9. This is a strategic guess based on disrupting any pattern they might be detecting in my play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Opponent's moves (recent): paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. My opponent switched from scissors to rock, and my scissors beat their rock.\n\n4. This is interesting because I've won with scissors against rock multiple times now (rounds 11, 17, and 22).\n\n5. After playing rock and losing, they might:\n   - Switch to paper (traditional sequence)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter my potential scissors play again)\n   - Stick with rock (less likely after just losing with it)\n\n6. Given their adaptability throughout the game, they're likely to switch away from rock after losing with it.\n\n7. If they switch to paper, I should play rock.\n   If they switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n   If they stick with rock, I should play scissors again.\n\n8. Since I've now won with scissors three times against their rock, they're likely to anticipate me playing scissors again and counter with paper.\n\n9.

This suggests they may be anticipating my adaptations very effectively.\n\n5. Looking at our history:\n   - When I win with a move, they often counter it effectively in the next round\n   - They seem to be one step ahead in predicting my strategic adjustments\n\n6. After playing scissors and winning, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors (persistence after success)\n   - Switch to paper (traditional sequence)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter my potential paper play)\n\n7.
