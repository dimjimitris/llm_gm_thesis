Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Now I need to consider what my opponent might do next, given that we both chose paper in round 1.\n4. Common Rock-Paper-Scissors psychology suggests that players who tie often change their move in the next round.\n5. Since we both played paper, there's a higher likelihood my opponent will switch to scissors, expecting me to play paper again.\n6. If I expect my opponent to switch to scissors, my optimal counter-move would be rock.\n7. However, my opponent might also anticipate this reasoning and choose rock themselves.\n8. Given the typical patterns in RPS, the most common move after a tie is to switch to the move that would have beaten the previous tie.\n9. In this case, since we tied with paper, many players would switch to scissors (which beats paper).\n10.

After scissors, they might expect me to play rock.\n10. If they expect rock from me, they might play paper to counter.\n11. To counter their paper, scissors would be optimal.\n12.

This is significant as it's the first time our moves haven't matched, suggesting my opponent may have changed their strategy.\n3. The fact that they played rock when I expected them to play paper implies they might be thinking one step ahead of my predictions.\n4. Previous rounds suggested they were either using similar reasoning or somehow matching my moves, but now it seems they anticipated my paper play.\n5. They've now shown they can break the pattern, which means I need to be more unpredictable.\n6. If my opponent thinks I'll be frustrated by the loss and play rock to beat their previous rock, they might play paper next.\n7.

There isn't an obvious pattern to what my opponent will play next.\n10. Given that my opponent just won with rock, they might be confident and stick with it (known as the \"win-stay\" strategy).\n11.

This is getting complex, but I need to break this cycle of being predictable.\n14.

Looking at their last few moves:\n   - Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: rock\n\n8. They seem to be alternating between rock and paper recently.\n\n9. If they continue this pattern, they would play paper next.\n\n10. Under these rules, to beat paper, I would need to play scissors.\n\n11. However, they might anticipate this and break their pattern.\n\n12. Given their adaptability, they might expect me to play scissors and counter with paper again (which beats scissors).\n\n13. To counter their potential paper, I would need to play rock.\n\n14. But they've shown they can adapt quickly, so they might expect this double-level reasoning.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors, betting that they'll continue their recent alternating pattern and play paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

In the last round, I played scissors expecting paper, and they did play paper, but paper beats scissors in this variant, so I lost.\n\n5. Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: paper\n\n6. They seem to be alternating between rock and paper in the last few rounds.\n\n7.

However, this is assuming they continue their pattern, which they've shown they can break when needed.\n\n10. There's another pattern I notice: whenever I've played scissors recently (rounds 9 and 11), they've played paper.\n\n11. This suggests they might be anticipating my moves rather than following a fixed pattern themselves.\n\n12. If they expect me to play scissors again (to beat their expected rock), they might play paper again (which beats scissors).\n\n13. To counter their potential paper, I would need to play rock.\n\n14. But if they expect this level of reasoning, they might play scissors to beat my rock.\n\n15. Given that I've been consistently outplayed, I need to try something different. I'll break my own recent pattern and choose a move I haven't played recently.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, betting they'll play paper again or scissors in anticipation of my rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves have been:\n   - Round 10: rock\n   - Round 11: paper\n   - Round 12: paper\n\n6.

Given their adaptability throughout the game, I think they're likely to switch to scissors, anticipating I might play rock again after my win.\n\n9. To counter their potential scissors, I would need to play paper.\n\n10. However, they might be thinking multiple steps ahead and expect me to play paper, in which case they might play rock.\n\n11. Looking at their overall pattern, they played paper in rounds 3, 6, 9, 11, and 12 - showing an increasing preference for paper.\n\n12. Given this preference and the psychological impact of just losing a round, they might revert to rock, which has been successful for them previously.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round, betting they'll switch to rock to counter my potential paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The complete game history is now:\n   - Round 1: paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: paper (tie)\n   - Round 4: scissors (tie)\n   - Round 5: paper (I lost to rock)\n   - Round 6: scissors (I lost to paper)\n   - Round 7: rock (I lost to scissors)\n   - Round 8: rock (tie)\n   - Round 9: scissors (I lost to paper)\n   - Round 10: paper (I lost to rock)\n   - Round 11: scissors (I lost to paper)\n   - Round 12: rock (I won against paper)\n   - Round 13: scissors (I won against rock)\n   - Round 14: rock (I lost to scissors)\n   - Round 15: scissors (I lost to paper)\n   - Round 16: paper (I won against scissors)\n   - Round 17: scissors (tie)\n   - Round 18: rock (I lost to scissors)\n   - Round 19: scissors (I lost to paper)\n\n2. My record is now 3 wins, 10 losses, and 6 ties.\n\n3. In the last round, I played scissors and they played paper. Under our rule set (paper beats scissors), I lost.\n\n4. My opponent's recent moves have been:\n   - Round 17: scissors\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: paper\n\n5. They broke their scissors streak by switching to paper, which successfully countered my scissors.\n\n6. This suggests they accurately predicted I would play scissors.\n\n7. Looking at the pattern more broadly:\n   - They played scissors three times (rounds 16-18)\n   - Then switched to paper (round 19)\n   - If they're establishing a new pattern, they might play paper again or switch to rock\n\n8. My opponent has displayed strong adaptability and seem to be very good at anticipating my moves.\n\n9. When I've played scissors recently (rounds 15, 17, 19), they've responded with:\n   - paper (win)\n   - scissors (tie)\n   - paper (win)\n\n10. This shows a tendency for them to play paper against my scissors.\n\n11. If I play scissors again, they might play paper again.\n    If I play rock, they might anticipate this and play scissors.\n    If I play paper, they might anticipate this and play rock.\n\n12. Given their demonstrated ability to predict my moves, I need to be less predictable.\n\n13. Let's try a move they might not expect. Since I've just played scissors and lost to paper, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their paper.\n\n14. If they expect me to play rock, they would play scissors to counter.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, breaking the pattern they might expect (me switching from scissors to rock after losing). This could catch them off guard if they play scissors expecting my rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My record is now 4 wins, 10 losses, and 6 ties.\n\n3. In the last round, I played paper and they played scissors. Under our rule set (paper beats scissors), I won.\n\n4. My opponent's recent moves have been:\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n\n5. They've switched back to scissors after a single paper play.\n\n6. Looking at what happened after my previous wins:\n   - After round 12 (I won with rock), they played rock in round 13\n   - After round 13 (I won with scissors), they played scissors in round 14\n   - After round 16 (I won with paper), they played scissors in round 17\n\n7. This suggests they might play paper next (repeating my winning move from round 20).\n\n8. However, they've also shown adaptability and might break this pattern.\n\n9. If they expect me to counter their potential paper with rock, they might play scissors.\n\n10. The fact that they just lost might make them less predictable as they try to regain momentum.\n\n11. Given their adaptability throughout the game, I think they're likely to play rock, expecting either that I'll repeat my successful paper move or that I'll anticipate their paper and play rock.\n\n12. To counter their potential rock, I would need to play scissors.\n\n13. However, if they anticipate this reasoning and play paper instead, my scissors would lose.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round, betting they'll switch to paper to counter my potential scissors play or to mimic my winning move (as they've done after my wins before).\n\n[move] rock\n"

My opponent's recent moves have been:\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: paper\n\n5. They're alternating between paper and scissors recently.\n\n6. Looking at what happened after my consecutive wins:\n   - Rounds 12-13: After winning with rock, I won again with scissors\n   - Rounds 20-21: After winning with paper, I won again with rock\n\n7. I'm now on a two-win streak, which hasn't happened since rounds 12-13.\n\n8. After my two consecutive wins in rounds 12-13, I lost in round 14 when I played rock against their scissors.\n\n9. Given that I've won twice in a row, my opponent will likely change their strategy more dramatically.\n\n10. If they continue their recent paper-scissors alternation, they would play scissors next.\n\n11. However, they've also shown adaptability and might break this pattern, especially after losing twice.\n\n12. Given their recent losses, they might:\n    - Try to break my momentum with an unexpected move\n    - Return to strategies that were successful earlier in the game\n    - Anticipate that I'll play scissors next (to beat their expected paper)\n\n13. If they expect me to play scissors next, they would play paper to counter.\n\n14. Looking at the full game history, when they've lost two or more consecutive rounds, they tend to change their strategy significantly.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose scissors for this round. This continues my strategy of trying to anticipate their adaptations while building on my momentum. If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'll win under our rule set where scissors beats rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent's recent moves have been:\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - Round 22: paper\n\n5. They've repeated paper, which successfully countered my scissors.\n\n6. This suggests they accurately predicted I would play scissors.\n\n7. When they've repeated paper in the past (rounds 2-3, 21-22), their next moves have varied.\n\n8. Let's examine my opponent's overall tendencies:\n   - Paper has been their most played move (9 times)\n   - Rock has been their second most played (7 times)\n   - Scissors has been their least played (6 times)\n\n9. They've been successful with paper against me, winning 5 times when playing paper.\n\n10. Given their success with paper and their recent paper repeat, they might:\n    - Continue playing paper since it's been successful\n    - Anticipate I'll switch to rock to beat their paper, and play scissors\n    - Mix up their strategy to remain unpredictable\n\n11. Their pattern over the last several rounds has been quite adaptive, suggesting they're good at anticipating my moves.\n\n12. If they expect me to play rock (to counter their paper), they would play scissors.\n\n13. If they expect me to anticipate this and play scissors (to counter their scissors), they would play paper.\n\n14. Given their demonstrated ability to predict my moves and their success with paper, I think they're more likely to play scissors, expecting me to play rock to counter their recent paper success.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round, betting they'll switch to scissors to counter my expected rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"
