    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, psychological research suggests that first-time players tend to choose rock more frequently than the other options.\n4. If my opponent is likely to choose rock, then paper would be my optimal counter-move.\n5. That said, if my opponent is thinking at a deeper level, they might anticipate this and choose scissors.\n6.

Their move to rock might indicate:\n   - They're starting a new pattern\n   - They're now playing randomly\n   - They're countering what they expect me to play\n\n5. Since they played rock last round, if they're playing what beats my previous move, they'll expect me to play paper (to beat their rock) and will play scissors.\n\n6. If they're starting a new fixed pattern with rock, they might play paper next.\n\n7. Without a clear new pattern yet, I need to make a reasonable guess.\n\n8. I'll assume they might be countering what they think I'll play. Since rock was successful for them, they might play rock again expecting me to play scissors again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose paper for this round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I won.\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper.

My opponent broke their previous pattern in round 11 (played rock instead of paper) and in round 12 played scissors.\n\n3. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors\n\n4. Two possibilities for their new strategy:\n   - They could be starting a new fixed pattern\n   - They could be playing what would beat what I just played\n\n5. If they're playing what beats my previous move, since I played paper last round, they'd expect me to play scissors this round, and would counter with rock.\n\n6. If they're following a new fixed pattern starting with rock \u2192 scissors, they might play paper next.\n\n7. Given that they've been adaptive enough to break their previous pattern when I started winning consistently, it seems more likely they're adjusting based on my moves rather than starting a new fixed pattern.\n\n8. Based on this reasoning, I'll assume they'll try to counter what they expect me to play. If they expect scissors from me, I'll play rock instead.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock for this round.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Since I've lost the last 3 rounds, they might expect me to change my strategy dramatically.\n\n7.

Their break in pattern might indicate:\n   - They're starting a new pattern\n   - They're now playing randomly\n   - They're countering what I played last (rock)\n   - They anticipated I would expect scissors and deliberately changed\n\n5. With only one move of the new strategy, it's hard to determine what they'll do next.\n\n6. If they're now playing what beats my previous move, they would play scissors next (to beat my rock).\n\n7. Without a clear new pattern yet, I need to make a reasonable prediction.\n\n8. I'll assume they're trying to counter my moves directly.

If they've started a new pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 ?), we don't yet know what comes next.\n\n7.
