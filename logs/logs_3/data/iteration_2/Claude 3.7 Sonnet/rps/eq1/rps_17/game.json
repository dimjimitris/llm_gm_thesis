In Rock Paper Scissors, without prior information, no single move has an inherent advantage.\n3. Rock, paper, and scissors each have equal 1/3 probability of winning in a truly random game.\n4. Since I have no information about my opponent, any choice is equally rational.\n5. However, studies suggest that rock is often chosen as a first move by many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n6. If my opponent follows this tendency, paper would be the optimal counter.\n7. But I also need to consider that my opponent might anticipate this reasoning and choose scissors.\n8.

Without any information about my new opponent's tendencies, I'm still in a position of making a choice with equal theoretical odds.\n4. Since rock is often a common first choice for many players (as mentioned in my previous reasoning), paper remains a reasonable strategic choice.\n5. However, to avoid being predictable myself, I should consider varying my strategy.\n6. Research suggests that in the absence of patterns, rock is slightly favored by first-time players, followed by scissors, with paper used least often.\n7. Given this, I'll choose rock this time - it has a good chance against scissors if my opponent follows common tendencies.\n8. This also helps me establish unpredictability in case I play multiple rounds against the same opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

In the previous round, I chose rock and my opponent chose scissors, resulting in my win.\n2. Now I need to consider whether my opponent will adapt their strategy based on this outcome.\n3. Common Rock Paper Scissors psychology suggests that after losing, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice.\n4. Since my opponent played scissors and lost, they might switch to rock (which would have beaten my hypothetical paper).\n5. If they follow this pattern and choose rock, my optimal response would be paper.\n6.

Another possibility is that they'll stick with scissors, thinking I wouldn't expect them to repeat a losing move.\n8. Weighing these options, paper seems like the strongest choice because:\n   - It beats rock (their most likely move if they follow common patterns)\n   - If they choose scissors again, I would lose, but this seems less likely\n   - If they choose paper too, it's a tie\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent has now lost 5 consecutive rounds, using all three possible moves during this losing streak:\n   - Paper (rounds 7, 10)\n   - Rock (rounds 8, 11)\n   - Scissors (round 9)\n\n5. Looking at my recent moves:\n   - Round 9: rock (won)\n   - Round 10: scissors (won)\n   - Round 11: paper (won)\n\n6. I've been cycling through all three moves and winning with each one, which suggests my opponent isn't adapting effectively to my strategy.\n\n7. After losing with rock in round 11, they are likely to:\n   a) Switch to scissors (to counter my potential paper play again)\n   b) Try paper again (which they've used most frequently)\n   c) Stick with rock out of frustration or hoping I'll change my pattern\n\n8. Given their pattern of switching moves after losses, option (a) seems most likely - they'll play scissors.\n\n9. The optimal counter to scissors would be rock.\n\n10. Even if they're becoming completely random due to frustration, rock has historically worked well against this opponent (won in rounds 1, 3, 9).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Given their tendency to switch moves after losses and considering they haven't played the same move twice in a row recently, paper seems most likely.\n\n9. They've played paper 5 times in our match, more than any other move, suggesting a preference.\n\n10. If they play paper, my optimal counter would be scissors.\n\n11.

My record is now 16 wins, 2 ties, 1 loss - an extraordinary performance.\n\n4. My opponent has lost an astonishing 13 consecutive rounds, yet continues to follow the exact same predictable pattern.\n\n5. The last nine moves from my opponent confirm their unwavering pattern:\n   - Round 11: rock\n   - Round 12: scissors\n   - Round 13: paper\n   - Round 14: rock\n   - Round 15: scissors\n   - Round 16: paper\n   - Round 17: rock\n   - Round 18: scissors\n   - Round 19: paper\n\n6. They are consistently cycling through rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper without any deviation despite their continued losses.\n\n7. Based on this established pattern, after losing with paper, my opponent's next move will be rock.\n\n8. Despite their 13-round losing streak, they have shown absolutely no adaptation, suggesting they'll continue this pattern.\n\n9. The optimal counter to their anticipated rock would be paper.\n\n10. My strategy of perfectly countering their predictable pattern has been incredibly effective, and I should continue this approach.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
