    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My current score is -1 point after ten rounds (three wins, four losses, three ties).\n\n3. Analyzing the opponent's rock plays:\n   - They've played rock in rounds 2, 4, 6, and 10\n   - When they play rock, they've beaten my scissors three times (rounds 4, 6, 10)\n   - They lost to my paper once with rock (round 2)\n\n4. Looking at my scissors plays:\n   - I've played scissors three times (rounds 4, 6, 10)\n   - Each time I played scissors, they played rock and beat me\n   - This suggests they are good at anticipating when I'll play scissors\n\n5. After I lose a round:\n   - Round 3 loss \u2192 I played scissors in round 4 (lost)\n   - Round 4 loss \u2192 I played rock in round 5 (won)\n   - Round 6 loss \u2192 I played paper in round 7 (tie)\n   - Now after round 10 loss, what should I play?\n\n6. The opponent seems to have a strong tendency to play rock against my scissors.\n\n7. They've played rock in 4 of 10 rounds, making it their most common move.\n\n8. The best counter to rock is paper.\n\n9. If they expect me to adapt after losing to rock again, they might anticipate I'll play paper and switch to scissors.\n\n10. However, given their success rate with rock against me, they might stick with it, thinking I'll play scissors again or switch to rock.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper, anticipating the opponent will play rock again after its success against my scissors in the previous round.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My current score is -2 points after eleven rounds (three wins, five losses, three ties).\n\n3. I've now lost two consecutive rounds:\n   - In round 10: I played scissors, they played rock\n   - In round 11: I played paper, they played scissors\n   - This suggests they're successfully anticipating my moves or I'm becoming predictable\n\n4. Analyzing my opponent's recent plays:\n   - Their last two moves were rock followed by scissors\n   - Looking at their previous moves, they played rock\u2192scissors also in rounds 4\u21925\n\n5. After they play scissors:\n   - In round 5, they played scissors \u2192 I played scissors in round 6 and lost\n   - In round 8, they played scissors \u2192 I played paper in round 9 and tied\n   - Now they played scissors in round 11 \u2192 what should I play?\n\n6. Looking at the full game:\n   - They've played rock 4 times\n   - They've played paper 3 times\n   - They've played scissors 4 times\n   - Their distribution is becoming more balanced over time\n\n7. Given they just won with scissors, they might:\n   a) Stick with scissors expecting me to play paper again\n   b) Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n   c) Switch to paper thinking I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n8. Rock would be the safest move as it beats scissors if they repeat, and ties with rock if they switch.\n\n9. Since I've lost two rounds in a row, I need to break this pattern.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock, anticipating the opponent might stick with scissors after their recent success, or switch to rock which would result in a tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Analyzing the opponent's recent play pattern:\n   - Their last three moves were rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This is a complete cycle through all three options in the canonical order\n\n5. If they continue this pattern, their next move would logically be rock.\n\n6. Looking at their complete strategy:\n   - When I play scissors, they almost always play rock (3 out of 4 times)\n   - When I play paper, they play rock once, paper three times, and scissors once\n   - When I play rock, they play paper twice and scissors twice\n\n7. They've been successful at anticipating my moves in the last three rounds, suggesting they might be identifying patterns in my play.\n\n8. Breaking down my patterns:\n   - After I lose with scissors, I've played rock once, paper twice\n   - After I lose with paper, I've played rock once\n   - After I lose with rock, I haven't established a pattern yet\n\n9. Given the opponent's pattern of rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper in the last three rounds, if they continue this sequence, they'll play rock next.\n\n10. The best counter to their potential rock move would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper, anticipating the opponent will play rock next if they continue their apparent cycle.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Rounds 10-13: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - This confirms they followed the rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock cycle I predicted\n\n4. If they continue this pattern, their next move should be scissors.\n\n5. Looking at their overall behavior when I win:\n   - Round 2: I won with paper \u2192 They played paper in round 3 (breaking cycle)\n   - Round 5: I won with rock \u2192 They played rock in round 6 (breaking cycle)\n   - Round 8: I won with rock \u2192 They played paper in round 9 (following possible cycle)\n   - Now round 13: I won with paper \u2192 If they follow the pattern, they play scissors\n\n6.

The opponent has shown a consistent cycle in the last four rounds (rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock).\n\n8. If they continue this cycle, they'll play scissors next.\n\n9. The best counter to scissors would be rock.\n\n10. However, they might also anticipate that I've detected their pattern and break it.\n\n11. If they expect me to play rock to counter their expected scissors, they might play paper instead.\n\n12. But since they've been so consistent with this pattern recently, I believe they'll likely continue with scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock, anticipating the opponent will follow their established cycle and play scissors next.\n\n[move] rock\n"

However, they might realize I've detected their pattern and break it by playing something unexpected.\n\n11.

My current score is -1 point after fifteen rounds (five wins, six losses, four ties).\n\n3. The opponent's recent pattern was disrupted:\n   - Rounds 10-14: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Expected continuation: scissors (round 15) \u2192 paper (predicted round 16)\n   - Actual: scissors (round 15)\n\n4. They played scissors when I expected paper, breaking their previous rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper cycle.\n\n5. This could mean:\n   a) They realized I had detected their pattern and changed it\n   b) They accidentally played scissors instead of paper\n   c) They're starting a new pattern\n\n6.

The most frequent move after a tie is rock (2 out of 3 times).\n\n8. However, since this is the first scissors-scissors tie, previous patterns may not apply.\n\n9. If they think I'll expect them to play rock after a tie (based on their history), they might play paper instead.\n\n10. Given that we both just played scissors, they might expect me to switch to rock (the natural counter to scissors), and play paper to counter that.\n\n11. Since they broke their established pattern in the previous round, they're likely thinking more adaptively now.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock, anticipating the opponent might play scissors again or switch to a different move that rock would either beat or tie against.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Their pattern after I play rock seems to alternate between paper and scissors, with paper in rounds 3, 12, and 16, and scissors in rounds 5, 8, and 14.\n\n7. If this alternating pattern continues, they should play scissors next time I play rock.\n\n8.

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n\n2. My current score is -1 point after seventeen rounds (six wins, seven losses, four ties).\n\n3. Looking at the opponent's recent plays:\n   - Rounds 13-17: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - There doesn't seem to be a clear pattern anymore\n\n4. Analyzing what happens after I win with paper:\n   - Round 2: I won with paper \u2192 They played paper in round 3\n   - Round 13: I won with paper \u2192 They played scissors in round 14\n   - Now Round 17: I won with paper \u2192 What will they play?\n\n5. Their responses vary, but after my paper wins, they've played both paper and scissors.\n\n6. Let's check what happens when they lose with rock:\n   - Round 2: They lost with rock \u2192 They played paper in round 3\n   - Round 13: They lost with rock \u2192 They played scissors in round 14\n   - Now Round 17: They lost with rock \u2192 What will they play?\n\n7. After losing with rock, they've switched to paper once and scissors once.\n\n8. Since I just won with paper, the opponent might expect me to stick with paper again (a common psychological tendency to repeat winning moves).\n\n9. If they expect me to play paper again, their best move would be scissors.\n\n10. However, they might also think I'll anticipate this and switch to rock, in which case they would play paper.\n\n11. Looking at the overall distribution:\n    - They've played rock 7 times\n    - They've played paper 6 times\n    - They've played scissors 4 times\n    - Rock has been their most common move\n\n12. Given that they just played rock and lost, and considering their previous behavior after losing with rock (switching to paper or scissors), scissors seems like their most likely move.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock, anticipating the opponent will switch to scissors after losing with rock, which would align with one of their previous patterns after a rock loss.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current score is -2 points after eighteen rounds (six wins, eight losses, four ties).\n\n3. Looking at the opponent's recent plays:\n   - Rounds 16-18: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - They seem to be alternating between paper and rock in the last three rounds\n\n4. A concerning pattern is emerging with my rock plays:\n   - Round 3: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Every time I've played rock in recent rounds (except 14), they've played paper and won\n   - They seem to be very successful at anticipating or countering my rock plays\n\n5. Analyzing my opponent's responses to my moves:\n   - When I play rock, they play paper 4 times, scissors 3 times\n   - When I play paper, they play rock 2 times, paper 3 times, scissors 1 time\n   - When I play scissors, they play rock 3 times, scissors 1 time\n\n6. Looking at their recent pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), if they continue alternating, they would play rock next.\n\n7. Also noting that after I lose with rock, I've sometimes switched to paper, which they might anticipate.\n\n8. If they expect me to play paper (based on my past behavior after rock losses), they might play scissors.\n\n9. However, considering their recent alternating pattern of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, rock seems likely to be their next move.\n\n10. Given that I've lost with rock multiple times against their paper, I should avoid playing rock for now.\n\n11. The best counter to their potential rock move would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper, anticipating the opponent will follow their recent alternating pattern and play rock next after playing paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score is -1 point after nineteen rounds (seven wins, eight losses, four ties).\n\n3. Looking at the opponent's recent plays:\n   - Rounds 17-19: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They've continued their alternating pattern between paper and rock\n\n4. My recent paper plays have been very successful:\n   - Round 13: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played rock (I won)\n   - I've won with paper in each of the last three times I've played it\n\n5. If the opponent continues their recent alternating pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), their next move should be paper.\n\n6. Additionally, they might recognize that I've been successful with paper recently and expect me to play it again.\n\n7. If they expect me to play paper again, they would play scissors to counter it.\n\n8. Looking at the opponent's behavior after losing:\n   - After losing in Round 17 (with rock), they played paper in Round 18\n   - This shows they adapt after losses\n\n9. After consecutive losses, they've typically changed their strategy.\n\n10. Given that they just lost with rock against my paper, and considering their recent alternating pattern, they're very likely to play paper next.\n\n11. The best counter to paper would be scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors, anticipating the opponent will follow their recent alternating pattern between rock and paper, playing paper next after their rock loss.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

The opponent broke their alternating pattern of rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock by playing scissors in round 20.\n\n4. Looking at what happened after the previous scissors-scissors tie:\n   - Round 15: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 They played paper in round 16\n   - Now Round 20: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 What will they play?\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after ties in general:\n   - Round 1 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played rock in round 2\n   - Round 7 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played scissors in round 8\n   - Round 9 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played rock in round 10\n   - Round 15 (scissors-scissors tie) \u2192 They played paper in round 16\n   - After ties, they've played rock twice, scissors once, and paper once\n\n6. After the previous scissors-scissors tie (round 15), they played paper in the next round (16).\n\n7. They might expect me to play rock after our scissors tie (a common move after a scissors tie to beat the potential repeated scissors).\n\n8. If they expect me to play rock, they would play paper to counter it.\n\n9. However, they might also anticipate that I'll try to predict their move and play something unexpected.\n\n10. Rock would be a relatively safe choice as it beats scissors (if they repeat) and loses only to paper.\n\n11. Given that we had a tie with scissors and the previous time this happened they played paper next, paper is their most likely next move.\n\n12. The best counter to their potential paper play would be scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose scissors, anticipating the opponent might play paper after our scissors tie, as they did in a similar situation previously.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current score is 0 points after twenty-one rounds (eight wins, eight losses, five ties).\n\n3. I've made progress from -1 to 0 points in the last round.\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's recent plays:\n   - Rounds 19-21: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - This sequence is familiar - it's the classic rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper progression\n\n5. If they continue this sequence, their next move should be rock.\n\n6. Analyzing what happens after I win with scissors:\n   - Round 5: I won with rock \u2192 They played rock in round 6\n   - Round 8: I won with rock \u2192 They played paper in round 9\n   - Round 14: I won with rock \u2192 They played scissors in round 15\n   - Round 21: I won with scissors \u2192 What will they play?\n   - No clear pattern after my wins\n\n7. Looking at what happens when they lose with paper:\n   - Round 3: They lost with paper \u2192 They played rock in round 4\n   - Round 12: They lost with paper \u2192 They played rock in round 13\n   - Round 16: They lost with paper \u2192 They played rock in round 17 \n   - Round 18: They lost with paper \u2192 They played rock in round 19\n   - Round 21: They lost with paper \u2192 What will they play?\n   - Strong pattern: After losing with paper, they've played rock every time (4/4)\n\n8. This pattern is very consistent: when they lose with paper, they play rock in the next round.\n\n9. Also, if they continue their recent rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper sequence, they would play rock next.\n\n10. Both patterns point to rock as their most likely next move.\n\n11. The best counter to rock would be paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose paper, anticipating the opponent will play rock based on both their consistent pattern after paper losses and their recent rock\u2192scissors\u2192paper sequence.\n\n[move] paper\n"

My current score remains 0 points after twenty-two rounds (eight wins, eight losses, six ties).\n\n3. The opponent broke my prediction and didn't play rock as expected, but played paper instead.\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's behavior after paper-paper ties:\n   - Round 1 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played rock in round 2\n   - Round 7 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played scissors in round 8\n   - Round 9 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 They played rock in round 10\n   - Now Round 22 (paper-paper tie) \u2192 What will they play?\n   - After paper-paper ties, they've played rock twice and scissors once\n\n5. There's a 2/3 chance they'll play rock after our paper-paper tie, based on historical data.\n\n6. Looking at their overall pattern after ties:\n   - After paper-paper ties: rock (2 times), scissors (1 time)\n   - After scissors-scissors ties: paper (1 time), scissors (1 time)\n   - After ties in general: rock (2 times), scissors (2 times), paper (1 time)\n\n7. Rock appears to be their most common move after a tie, especially after paper-paper ties.\n\n8. If they play rock as predicted, scissors would lose.\n\n9. If they play scissors as they did once after a paper-paper tie, rock would win.\n\n10. If they play paper again (least likely based on history), it would be another tie.\n\n11. Given that they've played rock more frequently after paper-paper ties, and considering the high risk of scissors losing to rock, rock seems like the safest choice.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock, anticipating the opponent might play scissors after our paper-paper tie, as they did in one previous instance after a paper tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Let's review the updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played scissors \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (1 point)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 23: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n\n2. My current score remains 0 points after twenty-three rounds (eight wins, eight losses, seven ties).\n\n3. This is our first rock-rock tie in the game.\n\n4. Looking at the opponent's behavior after ties:\n   - After paper-paper ties: rock (2 times), scissors (1 time), paper (0 times)\n   - After scissors-scissors ties: paper (1 time), scissors (1 time), rock (0 times)\n   - After rock-rock ties: No historical data yet\n   - After ties in general: rock (2 times), scissors (2 times), paper (1 time)\n\n5. Based on their general behavior after ties, they tend to play rock or scissors more often than paper.\n\n6. After consecutive ties (rounds 22 and 23), they might be seeking to break this pattern with a decisive move.\n\n7. Looking at their behavior after my rock plays:\n   - When I play rock, they've played paper 4 times, scissors 3 times, and now rock 1 time\n   - They've beaten my rock with paper more often than not\n\n8. After I play rock and tie or win, what do they play next?\n   - Round 5: Rock (win) \u2192 They played rock in round 6\n   - Round 14: Rock (win) \u2192 They played scissors in round 15\n   - Round 23: Rock (tie) \u2192 What will they play?\n   - No clear pattern\n\n9. Looking at the frequency of their moves throughout the game:\n   - They've played rock 9 times\n   - They've played paper 8 times\n   - They've played scissors 6 times\n   - Rock has been their most common move\n\n10. Given that we just had a rock-rock tie, and they seem to play rock most frequently, they might:\n    a) Expect me to switch to paper to beat their potential repeated rock\n    b) Play scissors to counter my expected paper\n    c) Play paper themselves to beat a repeated rock\n\n11. The safest move would be rock again, which would beat their scissors if they try to counter my expected paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will choose rock again, anticipating the opponent might play scissors expecting me to switch to paper after our rock-rock tie.\n\n[move] rock\n"
