    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at their behavior after I win:\n   - After I won in round 3, they played scissors\n   - After I won in round 4, they played rock\n   - After I won in round 6, they played paper\n   - Now after I won in round 10, what will they play?\n8. There's no strong pattern in their responses after my wins, but they haven't repeated the same response.\n9. If they follow a non-repetition pattern, they wouldn't play rock, paper, or scissors again (which isn't possible).\n10. More likely, they might expect me to stay with rock after winning and play paper to counter.\n11. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate this and switch to scissors, in which case they'd play rock.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on the analysis, my opponent's most logical move would be to play paper to counter my potentially repeated rock. Given their adaptability shown throughout the game, I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their pattern after I win multiple rounds:\n   - After my wins in rounds 3-4, they played rock\n   - Now after my wins in rounds 10-11, they might feel pressured to break my winning streak\n7. This could lead them to make a more aggressive or unpredictable move.\n8. Their overall pattern shows they've played paper 5 times, rock 3 times, and scissors 3 times.\n9. They've just lost with paper, and psychologically, players often avoid repeating moves that just lost.\n10. This suggests they'll likely switch to either rock or scissors.\n11. If they think I might continue with scissors after winning with it, they would choose rock.\n12. If they think I might anticipate this and switch to rock, they would choose paper.\n13. If they think I might anticipate both of these and play paper, they would choose scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given that my opponent likely won't repeat paper after losing with it, and considering the psychological tendency to counter a winning move (my scissors), I believe they are most likely to play rock next.

I just won with paper against their rock.\n5. Their recent sequence shows: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n6. They've now played rock 7 times, paper 7 times, and scissors 4 times.\n7. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing in round 3 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After losing in round 4 with scissors, they played rock\n   - After losing in round 6 with scissors, they played paper\n   - After losing in rounds 10-12, they played paper\n   - After losing in round 16 with rock, they played paper\n   - Now after losing in round 18 with rock, what will they play?\n8. There's no strong consistent pattern in their post-loss moves.\n9. However, they've now lost with rock multiple times (rounds 3, 12, 16, 18).\n10. After consecutive losses with rock, they might be reluctant to use it again.\n11. Paper has been their most successful move against me.\n12. They might expect me to play paper again after my success, and counter with scissors.\n13. Alternatively, they might switch to paper, which has been their most successful move.\n14. Looking at overall game statistics, I've won 9 rounds, they've won 5, and we've tied 4 times.\n15. Given they're behind, they might take a more aggressive approach or change their strategy.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given their likely frustration after multiple rock losses, their success with paper against me, and the fact they might expect me to repeat my winning paper move, I believe they are most likely to play scissors. Therefore, I'll choose rock to counter their likely scissors play.\n\n[move] rock\n"

I just lost with rock against their paper.\n5. Their recent sequence shows: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n6. They've now played paper 8 times, rock 7 times, and scissors 4 times.\n7. Their preference for paper is becoming more pronounced (42% of their moves).\n8. Paper has been extremely successful for them against me (5 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties).\n9. Looking at patterns after they win:\n   - After winning in round 2 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in round 5 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in round 8 with rock, they played paper\n   - After winning in round 13 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in round 14 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in round 17 with paper, they played rock\n   - Now after winning in round 19 with paper, what will they play?\n10. There's a pattern: when they win with paper, they've played rock afterward 2 out of 3 times.\n11. However, they might recognize their strong success with paper and be tempted to use it again.\n12. They might also expect me to play scissors to counter their paper streak, and play rock to counter that.\n13. Given their increasingly clear preference for paper, I need to strongly consider countering with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Despite some indicators they might play rock after winning with paper, their strong success with paper against me (5-0-3 record) suggests they may stick with what's working. They've shown a statistical preference for paper overall (42%), and this would be a logical choice for them to continue their winning momentum. I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 1, they played paper\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 7, they played rock\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 9, they played scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 15, they played rock\n   - Now after scissors-scissors tie in round 20, what will they play?\n6. There's no consistent pattern in their moves after ties, though they haven't repeated the tie move (except once after the first tie).\n7. After our previous scissors-scissors tie (round 15), they played rock.\n8. Their overall move counts are now: paper 8 times (40%), rock 7 times (35%), scissors 5 times (25%).\n9. The relative rarity of their scissors moves (they've used it less frequently) might make them less likely to repeat it.\n10. Given that rock followed our last scissors-scissors tie, and rock has been their second most common move overall, they might play rock again.\n11. However, they might also recognize that I could anticipate this and instead play paper, which has been their most successful move against me.\n12. They may also be trying to establish new patterns to confuse me after this long game.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Based on their pattern after our previous scissors-scissors tie (playing rock), their statistical tendencies (rock is their second most frequent move), and psychological factors (avoiding repeating a move that just tied), I believe they are most likely to play rock.

I just lost with paper against their scissors.\n5. They've broken my prediction by using scissors after a scissors-scissors tie, contrary to their previous pattern.\n6. Their recent sequence shows: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n7. They've now played scissors 6 times (28.6%), which is still their least frequent move.\n8. Looking at their behavior after winning:\n   - After winning in round 2 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in round 5 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in round 8 with rock, they played paper\n   - After winning in round 13 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in round 14 with rock, they played scissors\n   - After winning in round 17 with paper, they played rock\n   - After winning in round 19 with paper, they played scissors\n   - Now after winning in round 21 with scissors, what will they play?\n9. They've won with scissors only once before, so there's no pattern to analyze there.\n10. However, they have now used scissors twice in a row, which is unusual for their overall pattern.\n11. Players rarely use the same move three times in a row in RPS, especially a move they use less frequently.\n12. After consecutive scissors plays (and a win), they're likely to switch to something else.\n13. Their most common follow-up after winning has been to play rock (3 times after wins).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Given their tendency to not repeat moves three times in a row, their historical pattern of often playing rock after wins, and the psychological satisfaction of winning with scissors, I believe they are most likely to switch to rock. Therefore, I'll choose paper to counter their likely rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We just tied with paper-paper, breaking their potential pattern.\n5. Their recent sequence shows: scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n6. They've now played paper 9 times (40.9%), rock 7 times (31.8%), and scissors 6 times (27.3%).\n7. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 1, they played paper\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 7, they played rock\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 9, they played scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 15, they played rock\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 20, they played scissors\n   - Now after paper-paper tie in round 22, what will they play?\n8. There's no consistent pattern in their moves after paper-paper ties (they've played paper, rock, and scissors).\n9. This is now our 4th paper-paper tie in the game, which is statistically significant.\n10. They might recognize this paper-paper pattern and try to exploit it by playing scissors.\n11. Alternatively, they might follow their pattern after our first paper-paper tie and play paper again.\n12.

Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 1, they played paper\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 7, they played rock\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 9, they played scissors\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 15, they played rock\n   - After scissors-scissors tie in round 20, they played scissors\n   - After paper-paper tie in round 22, they played rock\n   - Now after rock-rock tie in round 23, what will they play?\n8. There's no consistent pattern in their moves after ties, though they've never played the same move after different types of ties.\n9. After our previous paper-paper tie, they played rock, which I matched.\n10. They might be trying to establish a pattern to trick me into following it.\n11. After this rock-rock tie (our first), they have no established pattern to follow.\n12. Given the psychological tendency to not repeat the same move after a tie, they're unlikely to play rock again.\n13. Their most common move is paper, which would be reasonable for them to return to.\n14. They might also anticipate me thinking this way and play scissors instead.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: After analyzing their patterns and considering the rock-rock tie, I believe they are most likely to switch to their statistically preferred move (paper), rather than repeat rock or use their least common move (scissors). Therefore, I'll choose scissors to counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
