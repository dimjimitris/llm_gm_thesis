    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Rock-Paper-Scissors is theoretically a game of chance with each move having equal probability of winning if played randomly.\n3. However, studies suggest that in the first round, people tend to choose Rock more frequently as their first move (a common psychological tendency).\n4. Given this information, choosing Paper as my first move might give a slight advantage.\n5. However, this is a fresh opponent whose tendencies I don't know yet.\n6. For the first move, I'll go with Paper to potentially counter a Rock opening.\n7. As the game progresses, I can adjust my strategy based on any patterns I observe.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for my first move.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now I need to predict what they might do in the second round after a tie:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll switch to Rock (as Paper beat Rock last time)\n   - They might keep playing Paper if they think I'll stick with Paper\n   - They might switch to Scissors thinking I'll stay with Paper\n4. Most players tend to change their move after a tie, following a principle of strategic randomization.\n5. If they're thinking strategically, they might switch to Scissors expecting me to play Paper again.\n6. To counter this potential move to Scissors, my optimal play would be Rock.\n7. There's also the possibility they might overthink and choose Rock, in which case Paper would be best.\n8. Given the most common pattern in RPS of players switching after a tie, I'll assume they'll most likely switch to Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock to counter their likely switch to Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

After losing, players often change their strategy. My opponent lost with Scissors, so they're likely to switch.\n5. Common psychology in RPS suggests players often move to the option that would have beaten their previous choice.\n6. Since their last choice was Scissors, they might play Rock (which beats their previous Scissors).\n7. To counter a predicted Rock move, I should play Paper.\n8. There's also the possibility they might expect this reasoning and play Scissors again, but this seems less likely given the loss.\n9.

Statistical reinforcement:\n   - My opponent has now played Paper 8 times (80%) and Scissors 2 times (20%)\n   - They've played Paper SIX consecutive times now (rounds 5-10)\n   - They have still never played Rock after 10 rounds\n   - When I play Scissors, I'm now 4 for 4 in winning (100% success rate)\n\n3. Pattern certainty:\n   - After 10 rounds, the pattern is statistically significant\n   - They've lost 4 consecutive rounds playing Paper against my Scissors\n   - Despite these losses, they continue to play Paper\n   - This indicates either:\n     a) A programmed player with fixed probability distribution heavily favoring Paper\n     b) A human player committed to a Paper-dominated strategy regardless of results\n\n4. Rational strategy:\n   - The optimal move against an opponent showing 80% Paper play is clearly Scissors\n   - Their lack of adaptation despite repeated losses suggests they will continue with Paper\n   - Even after losing 4 consecutive rounds to the same move, they haven't changed strategy\n\n5. Adaptation consideration:\n   - If they were going to adapt, they likely would have done so already\n   - Four consecutive losses with Paper against Scissors hasn't changed their behavior\n   - The probability they suddenly change now seems extremely low\n   - Even if they do change, the expected value of Scissors is still highest given their history\n\n6. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Playing Scissors has consistently generated positive returns\n   - The cumulative evidence for Paper as their dominant strategy is overwhelming\n   - Any other play would ignore the clear statistical pattern\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors again, as all evidence continues to support that they will play Paper despite multiple consecutive losses to this counter-move.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Pattern assessment:\n   - The pattern has reached a level of consistency that defies normal strategic adaptation\n   - Five consecutive losses with Paper against my Scissors hasn't altered their behavior\n   - This strongly suggests either:\n     a) A programmed player with fixed probabilities\n     b) A player following a predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes\n     c) A player deliberately testing if I'll maintain my counter-strategy\n\n4. Game theory application:\n   - In a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, players should randomize equally\n   - My opponent's 82% Paper strategy is dramatically unbalanced\n   - The optimal exploitation of such an unbalanced strategy is to play Scissors consistently\n   - Even if they finally adapt, one loss would be minimal compared to 5 straight wins\n\n5. Risk evaluation:\n   - There is virtually no strategic reason to change my approach\n   - The expected value of playing Scissors remains significantly positive\n   - The probability they suddenly change after 7 consecutive Paper plays is extremely low\n\n6.

Critical pattern shift analysis:\n   - My opponent has finally played Rock for the first time after 11 rounds\n   - They broke their 7-consecutive Paper streak\n   - They specifically countered my Scissors strategy that had been winning\n   - This indicates they were aware of the pattern and deliberately chose to break it\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - Their dramatic shift suggests:\n     a) They were testing how long I would exploit their Paper pattern\n     b) They were setting up a trap by establishing a strong pattern, then breaking it\n     c) They knew I would continue with Scissors and planned this counter\n   - They've demonstrated strategic awareness and adaptation capability\n\n4. Prediction challenges:\n   - Their behavior has fundamentally changed, making prediction more difficult\n   - They could:\n     a) Return to their Paper-heavy strategy, thinking I'll abandon Scissors\n     b) Continue with Rock, anticipating I'll play Scissors again\n     c) Play Scissors, expecting me to counter their Rock with Paper\n\n5.

Strategic adaptation:\n   - Given their demonstrated ability to adapt and their recent success with Rock\n   - And considering they might expect me to counter Rock with Paper\n   - My optimal move is Rock, which would beat their potential Scissors\n   - This also protects against another Rock play (resulting in a tie)\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, adapting to their significant pattern break and anticipating either Rock again or a Scissors counter.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Pattern evolution analysis:\n   - After a long Paper streak, they've now played Rock twice consecutively\n   - This confirms a strategic shift in their gameplay\n   - Their move distribution is now: Paper 9 times (69%), Scissors 2 times (15%), Rock 2 times (15%)\n   - They seem to be transitioning to a more balanced strategy\n\n3.

Historical tendencies:\n   - When they lose with Paper against my Scissors:\n     - Early game: They continued playing Paper despite losses\n     - Mid-game: After multiple Paper losses, they eventually switched to Rock\n     - Now: They've just lost after returning to Paper\n   - Their history suggests they might persist with Paper despite losses, but they have demonstrated capacity to adapt\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - Their most logical move after losing to Scissors would be Rock\n   - However, their historical pattern shows a tendency to stick with moves despite losses\n   - They've now returned to their Paper-dominant strategy after their Rock phase\n   - The likelihood they'll switch to Rock to counter Scissors is higher than in early rounds but not certain\n\n6. Risk-reward evaluation:\n   - If they switch to Rock (somewhat likely): Rock ties, Paper wins, Scissors loses\n   - If they continue with Paper (somewhat likely based on history): Scissors wins\n   - If they play Scissors (least likely): Rock wins\n   - Considering their demonstrated adaptability mixed with stubbornness, Paper offers balanced risk-reward\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they might switch to Rock after losing to Scissors, while accepting the risk they might continue with Paper.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Pattern analysis update:\n   - After two Paper plays, they've switched back to Rock\n   - Their overall distribution: Paper 11/18 (61%), Rock 5/18 (28%), Scissors 2/18 (11%)\n   - They lost with Rock against my Paper\n   - They've shown a tendency to switch moves after losing\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - After losing with Rock against my Paper, they're likely to change strategies\n   - Their options:\n     a) Switch to Paper to counter my expected Rock\n     b) Switch to Scissors to counter my expected Paper\n     c) Stay with Rock despite the loss (less likely based on their pattern)\n\n4. Strategic prediction:\n   - Given their demonstrated adaptability after losses\n   - And my recent success with Paper against their Rock\n   - They would most logically play Scissors to counter my expected Paper play\n\n5. Risk-reward evaluation:\n   - If they play Scissors (most likely after their loss): Rock wins\n   - If they play Paper (possible if expecting me to play Rock): Scissors wins\n   - If they play Rock again (least likely given their pattern): Paper wins\n\n6. Meta-game reasoning:\n   - I've won the last two rounds\n   - They've shown they adapt after losses\n   - They would logically expect me to play Paper again (since it just worked)\n   - Their optimal counter would be Scissors\n   - To counter their expected Scissors, Rock is my best play\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Rock, anticipating they'll switch to Scissors to counter my previous successful Paper play.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Revised pattern analysis:\n   - Contrary to expectation, they played Rock again despite losing with it in round 18\n   - They've now played Rock 6/19 times (32%), with 5 Rock plays occurring in recent rounds\n   - Their distribution: Paper 11/19 (58%), Rock 6/19 (32%), Scissors 2/19 (10%)\n   - They seem willing to stick with Rock even after losses, similar to their earlier Paper persistence\n\n3. Psychological considerations:\n   - After a tie with Rock, they might:\n     a) Continue with Rock for a third consecutive time\n     b) Switch to Paper expecting me to play Rock again\n     c) Switch to Scissors anticipating I'll counter with Paper\n\n4. Pattern persistence assessment:\n   - They've previously shown they can stick with moves despite suboptimal results:\n     - Early game: Multiple Paper plays despite losses\n     - Mid-game: Multiple Rock plays despite ties and losses\n   - Their current Rock persistence suggests they might continue this pattern\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - If they continue with Rock (moderately likely given their pattern): Paper wins\n   - If they switch to Paper (possible if they expect repeated Rock): Scissors wins\n   - If they switch to Scissors (possible as a counter to expected Paper): Rock wins\n   - Given their demonstrated tendency to persist with moves and their recent Rock preference, Paper offers the highest expected value\n\n6. Balancing exploitation vs. prediction:\n   - While they might anticipate and counter my Paper play\n   - Their history shows a stronger tendency toward move persistence than adaptation\n   - The expected value of Paper against their Rock tendency outweighs the risk\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper, anticipating they might continue with Rock based on their demonstrated pattern of move persistence.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
