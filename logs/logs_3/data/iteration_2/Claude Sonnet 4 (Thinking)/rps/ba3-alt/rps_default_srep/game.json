Let me make sure I understand:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n- Rock beats paper (3 points to winner, -3 to loser)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nSo I played paper, opponent played scissors, paper beats scissors, I won and got 1 point. That makes sense now.\n\nFor the next round, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They played scissors first round and lost. They might:\n1. Stick with scissors\n2. Switch to rock (which would beat my paper if I play it again)\n3. Switch to paper\n\nIf they switch to rock, I should play scissors (scissors beats rock for 1 point).\nIf they stick with scissors, I should play paper again (paper beats scissors for 1 point).\nIf they switch to paper, I should play rock (rock beats paper for 3 points).\n\nRock gives me the highest potential payoff (3 points), so maybe I should go with rock, hoping they switch to paper.",

Paper beats scissors, so I won 1 point.\nIn round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper. Rock beats paper, so I won 3 points.\n\nSo the opponent's pattern so far: scissors, then paper.\n\nThey might be trying to counter what I played previously, or they might be going in some pattern. Let me think:\n- Round 1: opponent played scissors\n- Round 2: opponent played paper\n\nIf they're trying to counter my previous moves:\n- Round 1: I played paper, they played scissors (scissors beats paper, but they were wrong about the rules? No wait, paper beats scissors according to the rules)\n- Round 2: I played rock, they played paper (paper beats rock, but rock beats paper according to the rules)\n\nIt seems like they might be confused about the rules, or they're playing randomly, or they're trying to anticipate what I'll play.\n\nIf they continue this pattern, next might be rock. But that's a pretty weak pattern with only 2 data points.\n\nGiven that I've won both rounds so far, I should be careful not to get overconfident. The optimal strategy might depend on if they're learning or adapting.\n\nLet me consider what to play:\n- If they play rock next, I should play scissors (1 point)\n- If they play paper next, I should play rock (3 points) \n- If they play scissors next, I should play paper (1 point)\n \nI'm intrigued by the potential randomness of my opponent's strategy. With rock offering the highest reward, I'll experiment with my approach. Scissors could introduce an element of unpredictability, potentially catching them off guard. My previous moves of paper and rock suggest a need for strategic variation.\n\nConsidering their seemingly inconsistent play, I'll opt for scissors this round. This choice mixes up my strategy and might reveal more about their decision-making process.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
