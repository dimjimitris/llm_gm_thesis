Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-1)\n2. Paper and scissors both have lower rewards (+1) but different penalty structures\n3. Paper's worst case is -3 (against rock)\n4. Scissors' worst case is -1 (against paper)\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (presumably someone new), I need to think about what they might choose:\n- Fresh players often go with rock (it seems strong/aggressive)\n- Or they might go with paper (simple, common choice)\n- Scissors might be less intuitive for beginners\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. If I expect them to play rock, I should play scissors (+1 for me)\n2. If I expect them to play paper, I should play rock (+3 for me)  \n3. If I expect them to play scissors, I should play paper (+1 for me)\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player, rock seems like a common beginner choice.
