Since I'm playing against a fresh player, they likely don't have an established strategy yet and may play somewhat randomly or go with their first instinct.\n\n3. I should calculate expected values:\n   - Rock has the highest potential reward (+3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Against random play, rock has the best expected value of +2/3 points\n\n4. Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option people think of.\n\n5. Even if my opponent chooses scissors (which beats rock), I only lose 1 point, whereas if I chose paper and they chose rock, I'd lose 3 points.\n\n6. The high reward potential of rock (+3 points) makes it worth the risk in this first round.\n\n[move] rock"

Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move since it's often the first option people think of.\n\n5. Even if my opponent chooses scissors (which beats rock), I only lose 1 point, whereas if I chose paper and they chose rock, I'd lose 3 points.\n\n6.

I need to think about what move gives me the best expected value. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (someone new), I should consider what they might do.\n\n3. Let me think about the strategic considerations:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses\n   - Paper and scissors both give lower rewards/penalties (+1/-1)\n   - A fresh player might not have a sophisticated strategy yet\n\n4. What might a fresh player choose?\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might choose rock because it's often the first thing people think of\n   - They might choose based on what seems \"strongest\" \n\n5. If I assume random play from opponent:\n   - If I play rock: 1/3 chance of +3 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs rock)\n     Expected value = (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 + (-1/3) + 0 = 2/3\n   - If I play paper: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs scissors), 1/3 chance of -3 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs paper)  \n     Expected value = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 + (-1) + 0 = -2/3\n   - If I play scissors: 1/3 chance of +1 (vs rock), 1/3 chance of -1 (vs paper), 1/3 chance of 0 (vs scissors)\n     Expected value = (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 + (-1/3) + 0 = 0\n\nI'll choose rock as it offers the best expected value against random play.

If they anticipate my paper choice, they would logically choose rock to get +3 points against paper.\n\n6. To counter their likely rock choice, I should choose scissors, which beats rock for +1 point.\n\n7. Risk assessment for scissors:\n   - vs rock (their likely counter to expected paper): I win +1\n   - vs paper: I lose -1\n   - vs scissors: tie for 0\n\n8. This continues my successful pattern of staying one step ahead of their tactical thinking.",

I'll switch to scissors - it gives a decent reward if they stick with rock, and if they go to paper (thinking I'll play rock again), scissors loses to paper but only -1 points.\n\nActually, let me reconsider.
