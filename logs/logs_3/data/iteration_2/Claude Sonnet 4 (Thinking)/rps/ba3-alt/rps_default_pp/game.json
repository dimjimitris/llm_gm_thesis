According to the rules:\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\n\nSo my opponent got 1 point and I got -1 point. That means scissors beats rock, not the other way around.\n\nLet me think about this strategically. My opponent just played scissors. What might they play next? They might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it worked\n2. Switch to something else\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll play next\n\nSince they beat my rock with scissors, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll go to paper (which beats scissors), they might go to rock (which beats paper and gives 3 points). \n\nBut this is getting into complex game theory. Let me think about the payoff matrix:\n- paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- rock beats paper: +3 for rock, -3 for paper  \n- scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nRock gives the highest reward when it wins (+3), but also the highest penalty when it loses (-3). The other moves give +1/-1.\n\nSince my opponent just played scissors successfully, they might try it again, or they might expect me to counter with paper. If I play paper and they play scissors again, I lose 1 point. If I play paper and they switch to rock, I lose 3 points. If I play rock and they play scissors again, I lose 1 point.

I won, got 1 points.\n\nSo my current total is 0 points.\n\nThe opponent's pattern so far:\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\n\nThis could be random, or they could be following some pattern. Let me think about what they might do next:\n\n- If they're trying to be unpredictable, they might go with paper next (completing the cycle)\n- If they're reacting to my moves, they might think I'll continue with scissors and play rock again\n- If they're trying to counter-predict, they might expect me to play paper (thinking they'll play rock again) and play scissors\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n- paper beats scissors: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n- rock beats paper: winner gets 3, loser gets -3  \n- scissors beats rock: winner gets 1, loser gets -1\n\nSince rock beating paper gives the highest payoff (3 points), I should consider when to play rock strategically. If I think they'll play paper, rock is the best choice.\n\nGiven that they played scissors then rock, if they're trying to cycle through all options, paper would be next. If I play rock against their paper, I'd get 3 points.\n\nBut they might be thinking the same way - expecting me to expect paper and counter with rock, so they might play scissors instead.\n\nThis is getting into a lot of mind games.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
