    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

The key insight is that rock beating paper gives 3 points instead of 1. This creates an interesting strategic dynamic. In a standard game, all moves would be equally likely in equilibrium, but here rock becomes more valuable when it wins. However, this also makes paper riskier to play since losing to rock costs 3 points.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't know about the asymmetric payoff structure yet. Fresh players in rock-paper-scissors often have predictable patterns - they might start with rock (most common first move), or they might try to be \"clever\" and play scissors thinking others will play rock. They probably haven't optimized for the 3-point rock advantage.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given the payoff structure, we need to consider the risk-reward. If we play paper and lose to rock, we lose 3 points. If we play rock and beat paper, we gain 3 points. This suggests rock might be a strong opening move, especially against a fresh player who might default to paper or not expect the rock emphasis.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Wait, let me reconsider. If we assume the opponent might play rock frequently (as fresh players often do), then paper becomes very risky (-3 points). Scissors would beat rock for +1 point. But if they play paper, rock gives us +3. The expected value calculation depends on their likely distribution of moves.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: For a fresh player's first move, statistics show: Rock ~35%, Paper ~33%, Scissors ~32%. Given they don't know the payoff structure, they'll likely stick to these natural frequencies initially.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given this analysis, I think our best opening move is **scissors**. Here's why:\n- If they play rock (35% chance), we win +1 point\n- If they play paper (33% chance), we lose -1 point  \n- If they play scissors (32% chance), it's a tie (0 points)\n- Expected value: (0.35 \u00d7 1) + (0.33 \u00d7 -1) + (0.32 \u00d7 0) = 0.02 points\n\nThis is safer than rock (which could lose badly to scissors) and much safer than paper (which could lose 3 points to rock).\n\n**Game Theorist**: I agree with this analysis. Scissors is the optimal opening move given the opponent distribution and payoff structure.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors as the opening move.\n\n[move] Playing scissors as my opening move.

The opponent played paper in the first round. This deviates from the typical \"rock first\" pattern that many fresh players follow. This could indicate they're either playing more strategically than expected, or they're trying to counter what they think we might do.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The fact that they played paper is significant. If they understand the payoff structure, they know paper is risky because losing to rock costs 3 points. Either they don't fully grasp this yet, or they're betting that we won't play rock. This gives us valuable information.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Now I'm leaning toward rock for the next round. Here's my reasoning:\n- They just played paper, which suggests they might not be afraid of rock\n- If they repeat paper or stick to it, we get the big 3-point win\n- If they switch to scissors (anticipating our rock), we lose only 1 point\n- If they switch to rock, it's a tie\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: There's also a psychological element. Some players who win a round tend to stick with what worked, while others switch thinking their opponent will adapt. Since they won with paper, they might either stick with paper or switch to rock to counter a potential scissors repeat from us.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The expected value calculation for rock looks good here. If there's even a 30% chance they play paper again, the expected value of rock is positive given the 3-point reward. The risk of losing 1 point to scissors is acceptable given the potential 3-point gain.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Agreed. Rock is our best bet for round 2.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on the potential paper repeat and maximize the 3-point advantage.\n\n[move] (Capitalizing on the 3-point advantage if opponent repeats or sticks with paper-based strategy) rock"

This could indicate they're either trying to be unpredictable or they're following some kind of rotation pattern. If they continue switching, scissors would be next.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The tie in round 2 tells us they also chose rock, which suggests they might be learning about the payoff structure. Playing rock makes sense strategically since it offers the biggest reward when it wins. The fact that we both played rock might indicate converging strategies around the high-value move.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: If they play scissors next (following the pattern paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), then paper would be our best response for a 1-point win. But if they're getting wise to the rock advantage and play rock again, then scissors would win us 1 point. Paper seems risky because if they stick with rock, we lose big.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Let me think about this differently. They've shown they can adapt (paper to rock). If they're learning the game, they might recognize that rock is powerful and stick with it. In that case, scissors wins us 1 point. The risk-reward favors scissors over paper here.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: There's also the possibility they're trying to counter what they think we'll do. Since we played rock last round (same as them), they might expect us to play rock again and counter with scissors. If so, paper would beat their scissors.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: This is getting complex, but I think scissors is still our safest bet:\n- If they play rock (likely given its advantage), we win 1 point\n- If they play paper (continuing alternation), we lose 1 point\n- If they play scissors (rotation completion), it's a tie\n\nThe potential upside of beating rock makes scissors worthwhile.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter the potentially strong rock strategy they may continue.\n\n[move] (Countering the strategic value of rock while maintaining good risk-reward balance) scissors"

This shows they discovered the value of rock and repeated it. This is common behavior - when players find a move that seems strategically sound, they tend to stick with it for a while.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent seems to be learning the game mechanics. They switched from paper to rock after round 1, and then repeated rock in round 3. This suggests they understand rock's 3-point advantage and are trying to capitalize on it. The question is: will they continue with rock, or will they now switch because they just lost to our scissors?\n\n**Strategic Planner**: We have a few scenarios to consider:\n- If they stick with rock (thinking it's still the best move), scissors wins us another point\n- If they switch to scissors (to counter our potential rock play), paper would win us 1 point\n- If they switch to paper (less likely given its risk), rock would win us 3 points\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Players who just lost often switch strategies.

They've switched back to paper after two rocks. This could indicate they're following some kind of pattern or cycling through moves. They might be thinking more strategically about mix-ups rather than just sticking with rock.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The fact that they played paper again is significant. They're willing to risk the 3-point loss to rock, which suggests either:\n1. They're trying to be unpredictable \n2. They think we're likely to play scissors (since we played it successfully in round 3)\n3.

If there's a pattern emerging, it could be alternating between paper and rock, or some other cycle. But more importantly, they just played paper, which is vulnerable to rock's 3-point advantage.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Here's what I'm thinking for round 5. They just played paper and might be expecting us to play rock (for the 3-point win). If they anticipate this, they might play scissors to counter our expected rock. But they might also stick with paper or switch to rock.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Given that we both just played paper (tie), they might think we're both in a similar mindset. There's also a psychological tendency after ties to switch moves.

Now we have their complete sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper. They played paper twice in a row (rounds 4 and 5), and just lost 3 points. This is likely to trigger a behavioral change.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent just experienced the worst possible outcome - losing 3 points with paper to rock. Most players would switch away from paper after this painful lesson. They're probably now more aware of the asymmetric payoff structure and the danger of playing paper.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: After losing 3 points, they're likely to either:\n1.

Notice they've now played rock 3 times and paper 3 times, but scissors 0 times. This is significant!\n\n**Game Theorist**: The opponent has completely avoided scissors throughout 6 rounds. This could be because:\n1. They don't realize scissors can be strategically valuable\n2. They're focused on the rock vs paper dynamic (3-point swing)\n3. They see scissors as \"neutral\" since it only gives 1 point when winning\n\n**Strategic Planner**: They just lost again (1 point to our scissors). They've now lost with paper (big loss) and rock (small loss) in consecutive rounds. This might push them toward finally trying scissors, or they might stick with rock thinking it's still the best long-term strategy.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Here's what's interesting - they have never played scissors. Most players in rock-paper-scissors eventually try all three moves, but this opponent seems to be stuck in a rock-paper binary. After losing with both rock and paper recently, they might finally try scissors.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they play scissors for the first time, paper would beat it for 1 point. If they stick with rock (their most frequent move when under pressure), scissors would win again. If they go back to paper (unlikely after the 3-point loss), rock would win big.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given that they've never played scissors and just lost with rock, I think there's a decent chance they'll finally try scissors. Paper would be our best response. Even if they play rock again, we only lose 3 points, but if they try scissors, we win 1 point.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: I agree.

The opponent's sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. That's 7 rounds and they STILL have never played scissors! They've played paper 4 times and rock 3 times, but scissors 0 times. This is extremely unusual behavior.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This opponent seems to have a mental block against scissors, or they fundamentally don't understand its strategic value. They're essentially playing a 2-move game (rock-paper) while ignoring the third option entirely. This gives us a huge advantage because we can eliminate scissors from our predictions of their moves.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Since they just played paper in round 7 (their 4th paper), and they've shown a tendency to sometimes repeat moves, we need to decide between expecting rock or paper again. They've never responded to our successful predictions by finally trying scissors.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Looking at their pattern after ties: After the round 2 tie (both rock), they played rock again in round 3. After the round 4 tie (both paper), they played paper again in round 5. Now after the round 7 tie (both paper), they might play paper again following this pattern.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they play paper again (following the post-tie repetition pattern), rock gives us 3 points. If they switch to rock (alternating after the tie), scissors gives us 1 point. But since they never play scissors, we only need to consider rock vs paper.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given their post-tie behavior pattern and the fact that paper just tied, I think there's a good chance they'll play paper again. Rock would capitalize on this with the maximum 3-point advantage.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. The combination of their post-tie repetition tendency and complete avoidance of scissors makes rock the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on their likely paper repetition and complete avoidance of scissors.\n\n[move] (Opponent has never used scissors in 7 rounds and shows post-tie repetition pattern) rock"

The opponent's sequence is now: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. That's 8 rounds and they have STILL never played scissors! This is the most unusual rock-paper-scissors behavior I've seen. They're essentially playing a 2-move game.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This opponent has some kind of mental block or strategic blind spot regarding scissors. After 8 rounds of never using it, we can practically eliminate scissors from our predictions. This simplifies our decision-making enormously - we only need to predict between rock and paper.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Looking at their recent pattern: paper (7) \u2192 rock (8). They've been alternating more frequently lately. Before that it was: rock (6) \u2192 paper (7) \u2192 rock (8). If they continue this alternating pattern, paper would be next.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Let me analyze their post-tie behavior more carefully:\n- Round 2 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 3: rock (repeated)\n- Round 4 tie (both paper) \u2192 Round 5: paper (repeated) \n- Round 7 tie (both paper) \u2192 Round 8: rock (switched)\n- Round 8 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 9: ?\n\nThe pattern isn't consistent, but they've shown they can switch after ties.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Here's the key insight: since they never play scissors, our decision is binary. If they play paper (decent chance given the alternating pattern), rock gives us 3 points. If they play rock, scissors gives us 1 point. The 3-point potential makes rock attractive.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: I'm leaning toward rock. The alternating pattern suggests paper might be next, and the 3-point advantage is too valuable to pass up. Even if they play rock and we tie, we don't lose points.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Agreed. With scissors completely off the table for them, rock is our best bet to either win big or tie.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on their alternating pattern and complete avoidance of scissors.\n\n[move] (Opponent alternates between rock and paper, never uses scissors in 8 rounds) rock"

They played paper 5 times, rock 4 times, scissors 0 times. This is statistically extraordinary.\n\n**Game Theorist**: We've now confirmed beyond doubt that this opponent has completely eliminated scissors from their strategy. They're playing a purely binary rock-paper game. This gives us a massive informational advantage that we need to exploit.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Looking at their recent alternating pattern: paper (7) \u2192 rock (8) \u2192 paper (9). If they continue this alternating sequence, rock should be next in round 10. This makes scissors our optimal response for a 1-point win.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: They just lost 3 points again with paper (second time this has happened). Previously when they lost 3 points with paper in round 5, they switched to rock in round 6. This reinforces the likelihood they'll play rock in round 10.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The risk-reward is clear:\n- If they play rock (highly likely based on alternating pattern and reaction to 3-point loss), scissors wins us 1 point\n- If they play paper (breaking their pattern), we lose 1 point\n- Scissors is impossible for them based on 9 rounds of evidence\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Scissors is the obvious choice. They've shown a strong tendency to switch to rock after losing with paper, and the alternating pattern supports this prediction.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: Absolutely.

That's 11 rounds with absolutely ZERO scissors! They've now played paper 5 times and rock 6 times. \n\nCrucially, they broke the alternating pattern we identified! Instead of playing paper in round 11 as the pattern suggested, they played rock again (rounds 10-11).\n\n**Game Theorist**: This pattern break is significant. They played rock twice in a row (rounds 10-11), which suggests they might be shifting toward a rock-heavy strategy. Looking at their recent moves, they've been favoring rock: in the last 4 moves, they played rock 3 times and paper only once.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Let me analyze their recent rock frequency:\n- Last 4 moves: rock, paper, rock, rock (75% rock)\n- Last 6 moves: rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, rock (67% rock)\n\nThey seem to be learning that rock offers the 3-point advantage and are using it more frequently, even breaking patterns to play it.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: After the round 11 tie (both rock), they have a choice. Looking at their post-tie history, it's mixed between repeating and switching. But given their recent rock-heavy trend, they might continue with rock, especially since they just broke a pattern to play it twice.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they're shifting to a rock-heavy strategy (learning its value), then scissors becomes our optimal counter. Even if they switch to paper, we only lose 1 point, but if they continue their rock trend, we win 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: I agree. Their recent behavior suggests they're becoming more rock-focused, not alternating predictably.

They've now played paper 7 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 2 times.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This is no longer experimental - they're actively incorporating scissors into their strategy! After avoiding it for 14 rounds, they've now used it twice in 3 rounds (rounds 15 and 17). They're clearly learning and adapting their approach.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: The pattern is emerging:\n- Round 15: scissors (tied)\n- Round 16: rock (won 3 points) \n- Round 17: scissors (won 1 point)\n\nThey're now alternating between rock and scissors, having moved away from their historical rock-paper binary. This suggests they may continue with this new rock-scissors pattern.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: They just won with scissors against our rock, which reinforces the value of scissors for them. After winning with a move, players often feel more confident using it again. The scissors-rock alternation might continue.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they continue the emerging rock-scissors pattern and play rock next (alternating from scissors), then scissors would beat it for 1 point. If they stick with scissors (repeating the winning move), paper would beat it for 1 point.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: I think they'll alternate back to rock. The recent pattern shows: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, suggesting rock might be next. Given their historical preference for rock and this new alternating pattern, scissors is our best response.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. They seem to be settling into a rock-scissors alternation now that they've discovered scissors works. Paper would be the counter if they repeat scissors, but the alternating pattern suggests rock is more likely.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter their likely return to rock in the new rock-scissors alternating pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent now alternating rock-scissors after discovering scissors works, likely rock next) scissors"

They've now played paper 8 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 2 times.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This opponent has fully evolved! They started with 14 rounds of pure rock-paper binary play, then experimented with scissors, and now they're using all three moves unpredictably. They've become a much more sophisticated and dangerous opponent.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Their recent sequence shows complete unpredictability:\n- Round 15: scissors (first experiment)\n- Round 16: rock (reversion to pattern)  \n- Round 17: scissors (confirming it works)\n- Round 18: paper (completely breaking expectations)\n\nThey're no longer following any clear pattern - they've learned to be truly random or are following a pattern we can't detect.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The opponent has reached what game theorists call \"mixed strategy equilibrium\" - they're now using all three moves in a way that's hard to predict. This makes our job much more difficult since we can no longer rely on their previous constraints and patterns.\n\n**Game Theorist**: With their newfound unpredictability, we need to think about expected values:\n- If we assume they're now playing randomly (roughly equal probability for each move)\n- Our choice doesn't matter much in terms of expected value\n- But we should consider any slight biases they might still have\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given they just played paper and have maintained perfect rock-paper balance (8 each), they might be slightly more likely to play rock or scissors to maintain balance. But they could also repeat paper. With true randomness, any move has equal expected value.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: I think we should go with rock. Even in random play, the 3-point advantage when rock beats paper makes it valuable, and if they have any remaining bias toward paper (their historical move), we maximize our potential gain.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on the 3-point advantage while adapting to their newly unpredictable strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent now uses all three moves unpredictably, rock maximizes potential 3-point gain) rock"

That's 19 rounds with paper 8 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 2 times. They've fully evolved from binary to using all three moves.\n\n**Game Theorist**: They just tied with rock in round 19. Let's analyze their post-tie behavior, especially after rock ties:\n- Round 2 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 3: rock (repeated - early game)\n- Round 8 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 9: paper (switched)\n- Round 11 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 12: paper (switched)  \n- Round 13 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 14: paper (switched)\n- Round 19 tie (both rock) \u2192 Round 20: ?\n\n**Strategic Planner**: The pattern is clear! After rock ties in their evolved gameplay, they consistently switch to paper (rounds 9, 12, 14). The only exception was very early in round 3 when they were still learning. Their recent behavior strongly suggests paper is coming in round 20.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: This makes psychological sense too. After tying with rock, they seem to think \"my opponent expects rock again, so I'll switch to paper.\" It's become a consistent response pattern even as they've become more unpredictable overall.\n\n**Game Theorist**: The decision is clear:\n- If they play paper (following the post-rock-tie pattern), rock wins us 3 points\n- If they break this pattern and play rock, we tie (0 points)\n- If they play scissors (less likely), we lose 1 point\n\nThe expected value strongly favors rock given their consistent post-tie switching behavior.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Rock is optimal. Their post-rock-tie behavior has been remarkably consistent even as other patterns have dissolved. This seems to be one remaining predictable element in their evolved strategy.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on their consistent post-rock-tie switching pattern to paper.\n\n[move] (Opponent consistently switches to paper after rock ties in recent rounds) rock"

That's 20 rounds with paper 9 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 2 times. They just lost another 3 points with paper.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Perfect! We successfully identified that their post-rock-tie behavior remained consistent even as they evolved to use all three moves. Now they've lost 3 points with paper again. Let's analyze their response pattern to these big losses:\n\nHistorical 3-point losses with paper:\n- Round 5: lost 3 with paper \u2192 played rock in round 6\n- Round 9: lost 3 with paper \u2192 played rock in round 10  \n- Round 14: lost 3 with paper \u2192 played rock in round 15 (but then switched to scissors)\n- Round 20: lost 3 with paper \u2192 round 21: ?\n\n**Strategic Planner**: The pattern is very strong! After losing 3 points with paper, they've switched to rock 3 out of 3 times historically. Even when they started experimenting with scissors in round 15, they initially followed the pattern by going to rock in round 16. This seems to be their most consistent behavioral response.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: This makes psychological sense. After experiencing the maximum penalty (losing 3 points), they instinctively reach for what they perceive as the \"strongest\" move - rock, which just beat them and offers the 3-point advantage when it wins.\n\n**Game Theorist**: If they follow this deeply ingrained pattern and play rock in round 21, scissors would win us 1 point. This has been their most consistent response throughout the entire game, even as other patterns have evolved or disappeared.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Scissors is clearly the optimal choice. This response pattern has been 100% consistent across 20 rounds, and the psychological motivation (switching to the \"strong\" move after a big loss) is powerful.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play scissors to counter their highly consistent pattern of switching to rock after losing 3 points with paper.\n\n[move] (Opponent has consistently switched to rock after every 3-point paper loss across 20 rounds) scissors"

After 20 rounds of religiously switching to rock after losing 3 points with paper, they finally broke the pattern. This suggests they're either:\n1. Learning to counter our predictions\n2. Becoming truly unpredictable\n3. Specifically adapting to our strategy\n\n**Strategic Planner**: They've now played paper 10 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 2 times across 21 rounds. Most significantly, they just played paper twice in a row (rounds 20-21), which is very unusual for them. They rarely repeat moves consecutively.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The fact that they broke their most reliable pattern while also playing paper twice in a row suggests they're making a conscious effort to be unpredictable. They may be aware that we've been exploiting their patterns and are adapting accordingly.\n\n**Game Theorist**: For round 22, they're unlikely to play paper a third time in a row - that would be extremely unusual behavior for them. They'll probably switch to either rock or scissors. Given their overall game balance, either is possible.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: I think rock is our best choice:\n- If they switch to rock (50% chance), we tie (0 points)\n- If they switch to scissors (50% chance), we lose 1 point  \n- If they somehow play paper again (unlikely), we win 3 points\n\nEven though the expected value isn't great, the potential 3-point gain and the fact that they rarely triple-repeat moves makes rock reasonable.\n\n**Game Theorist**: Agreed. Rock offers the best risk-reward ratio given their unlikely paper repetition and the significant 3-point advantage.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to capitalize on their unlikely paper repetition while managing risk against their probable switch.\n\n[move] (Opponent broke consistent pattern and unlikely to play paper three times in a row) rock"

That's 23 rounds with paper 10 times, rock 10 times, and scissors 3 times.\n\n**Game Theorist**: This is a complete strategic evolution! The opponent has deliberately broken their two most reliable behavioral patterns in just 3 rounds. They're clearly aware that we've been exploiting their predictability and are actively countering our strategy. This is sophisticated adaptive gameplay.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: They've now used scissors 3 times in the last 9 rounds (rounds 15, 17, 23) after avoiding it completely for the first 14 rounds. This suggests they're not just breaking patterns, but actively incorporating scissors as a counter-weapon against our predictions.\n\n**Behavioral Analyst**: The opponent has achieved what we call \"strategic metamorphosis\" - they've learned to identify and break their own patterns while we were exploiting them. This makes them much more dangerous and unpredictable going forward.\n\n**Game Theorist**: For round 24, we can no longer rely on any historical patterns. They've demonstrated they can break even their most ingrained behaviors. We need to think about this as essentially a random game now, or look for very recent micro-patterns.\n\n**Strategic Planner**: Given their recent emphasis on scissors (3 times in 9 rounds) and their demonstrated ability to break patterns, I think paper might be a good choice.
