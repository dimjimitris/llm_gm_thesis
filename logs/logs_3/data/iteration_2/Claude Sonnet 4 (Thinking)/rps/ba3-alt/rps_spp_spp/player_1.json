    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They're more strategic than typical beginners\n2. They anticipated that we might expect rock and tried to counter-counter\n3. It was a random choice\n4. They may have read similar advice about rock being common and chose paper to counter it\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie gives us valuable information. Now we need to think about second-round psychology. After a tie, players often:\n1. Stick with the same move (thinking it \"worked\")\n2. Switch to try something different\n3. Try to counter what they think you'll do next\n\nGiven they played paper first, if they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to switch to scissors to counter their paper. This could make them want to play rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we have a few possibilities for their next move:\n- Stay with paper (if they think it \"worked\" or want consistency)\n- Switch to rock (if they expect us to play scissors)\n- Switch to scissors (random change or trying to be unpredictable)\n\nWhat's our best counter-strategy?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If we think they're likely to switch to rock (expecting us to play scissors), then paper again would give us the big 3-point win. If they stick with paper, it's another tie. The risk is if they switch to scissors, we lose 1 point.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I lean toward them switching to rock.

Let me re-examine the rules:\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)  \n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n\nI made an error! If we predicted the opponent would play rock, we should have chosen SCISSORS to beat rock, not paper. Paper loses to rock. This is a critical mistake in understanding the basic game mechanics.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** You're absolutely right about the rules correction. However, our psychological read was accurate - the opponent did switch to rock after the tie, just as we predicted. We just chose the wrong counter-move.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're now at -3 points total. The opponent has shown they're thinking strategically:\n- Round 1: Played paper (countering expected rock from fresh players)\n- Round 2: Played rock (perhaps expecting us to play scissors after the tie)\n\nWhat's their likely next move?\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After winning big with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it just worked and gives maximum points\n2. Switch to scissors expecting us to now play rock to counter their previous rock\n3. Go back to paper thinking we'll play scissors to counter their rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given they're showing strategic thinking, option 2 seems most likely - they may expect us to play rock to counter their successful rock strategy, so they'd play scissors. But they could also stick with the high-reward rock.\n\nIf we think they'll play scissors, we should play rock (gives us +3). If they stick with rock, we should play scissors (+1).

Psychologically, players often avoid playing the same move three times consecutively as it feels too predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. Plus, they may think we're catching onto their rock pattern and expect us to play scissors next. If they're strategic, they might:\n1. Switch to paper to counter our expected scissors\n2. Switch to scissors if they think we'll play rock to beat their expected scissors\n3. Stick with rock again, but this seems less likely after two rocks\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Current score is -3, so we need to be strategic about recovery. If we think they'll switch to paper (expecting us to play scissors), we should play rock for the big +3 points. If they play scissors, we lose -1. If they play rock again, it's a tie.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's the right risk analysis. The opponent has shown they can think multiple levels deep. Playing paper twice, then rock twice suggests they're not random. The high-reward play is rock if they choose paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree.

Our current score is -4 points, so we need to start winning to recover.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent just played scissors after two rocks. This suggests they anticipated we might play scissors to counter their rock pattern, so they played scissors to beat our potential rock. They're thinking at least two levels deep - what we think they'll do, and what we'll do in response.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their unpredictability and strategic depth, what's our best approach now? They've used all three moves, with rock appearing twice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** After winning with scissors, they might:\n1. Stick with scissors since it just worked\n2.

This confirms rock is their true preference - the paper was just a temporary tactical adjustment to our scissors streak.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Perfect example of their adaptation strategy. They switched to paper just long enough to disrupt our scissors momentum, then went right back to their preferred rock. This suggests they're not abandoning their rock-heavy strategy, just making temporary adjustments.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So we're back to the statistical advantage situation. Rock at 65% frequency means scissors should be profitable again. That one paper was likely just a tactical counter, not a strategic shift.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! All our wins came from scissors vs rock. The brief paper counter doesn't change the fundamental math. If they continue their rock preference, scissors remains our best play.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They may have thought that paper counter would make us abandon scissors entirely. But the data shows rock is still their dominant choice by far.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to scissors, betting they've returned to their rock-heavy pattern after the brief paper counter.\n\n[move] (Opponent returned to rock after brief paper counter, resuming statistical approach) scissors"

This is the same pattern as the paper counter - they disrupt our successful strategy with a tactical counter, then likely return to rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This confirms their adaptive approach:\n1. Let us establish a pattern (scissors beating their rock)\n2. Counter it temporarily (paper, then scissors)  \n3. Likely return to their preferred rock strategy\n\nAfter this scissors tie, they probably expect us to switch to rock to counter scissors, so they might go back to their beloved rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** So this scissors tie is probably just another temporary disruption, like the paper was. Their core strategy remains rock-heavy. Should we bet on them returning to rock?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Yes, the statistics still favor rock at 62%. These brief counters are tactical adjustments, not strategic shifts. They're trying to break our successful scissors pattern, but rock remains their fundamental preference.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After countering our scissors with their own scissors, they'll likely expect us to switch away from scissors. This might make them comfortable returning to rock.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Continue with scissors, expecting them to return to their rock pattern after the brief tactical counter.\n\n[move] (Opponent used scissors as tactical counter like they did with paper, expecting return to rock) scissors"

They returned to rock after the scissors counter. ALL 4 of our wins have come from scissors beating rock. The statistical approach is clearly superior to psychological prediction with this opponent.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The pattern is ironclad now:\n1. They prefer rock (64% usage)\n2. They make brief tactical counters when we succeed (paper, scissors)\n3. They return to rock after the counter\n4.

Every attempt at complex strategy failed, while simple statistical play (scissors) has given us all our wins. Should we continue the successful approach?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely! Rock at 64% frequency makes scissors mathematically optimal. Even if they occasionally counter, the overall expected value strongly favors scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** They might try another tactical counter soon since we just won again, but the fundamental rock preference seems unchangeable.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Stick with scissors, maintaining the statistically successful strategy.\n\n[move] (All wins came from scissors vs rock, continuing proven statistical approach) scissors"
