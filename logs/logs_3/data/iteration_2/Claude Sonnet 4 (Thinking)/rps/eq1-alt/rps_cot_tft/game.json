Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable.\n\n3. Think about common first-move patterns: Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice.\n\n4. Choose a counter-strategy: If they're likely to play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and gain +1 points.\n\n5.

Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - this suggests they may be inexperienced or unpredictable.\n\n3. Think about common first-move patterns: Many beginners tend to start with rock as it's often the most intuitive first choice.\n\n4. Choose a counter-strategy: If they're likely to play rock, I should play paper to beat rock and gain +1 points.\n\n5.

They might be inexperienced and make predictable moves\n2. They might choose randomly\n3. They might have some common beginner patterns\n\nFor a first move against a fresh player, I should consider:\n- Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first move people think of)\n- Some might go with scissors as it's perceived as aggressive\n- Paper is less commonly chosen as a first move\n\nIf I assume they're likely to choose rock, then I should choose paper to beat rock.\nIf I assume they choose scissors, then I should choose rock to beat scissors.\nIf I assume they choose paper, then I should choose scissors to beat paper.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about their playing style, I need to make an educated guess. Many psychological studies suggest that beginners often choose rock first, so paper would be a good counter-strategy.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that they might be thinking similarly and expect me to expect rock, so they might choose paper instead.\n\nGiven that this is a fresh player and the first move, I'll go with paper since:\n1. It beats rock (which is commonly chosen by beginners)  \n2. It's a solid choice that doesn't reveal too much about my strategy\n3. It gives me a good chance to score points early",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
