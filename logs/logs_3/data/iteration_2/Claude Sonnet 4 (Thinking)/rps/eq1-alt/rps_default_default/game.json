After breaking their rock streak with paper, they might go back to rock, or they might continue with a different pattern. Given that they just played paper and rock is their most common move, I should play paper to counter rock.\n\nBut wait, they might also think I expect them to go back to rock and play scissors instead. \n\nConsidering their pattern, I'm leaning towards anticipating another paper move.
