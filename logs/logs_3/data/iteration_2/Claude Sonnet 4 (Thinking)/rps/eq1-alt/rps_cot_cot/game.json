Looking at the payoff matrix: if they choose rock and I choose paper, I win (+1 point for me, -1 for them).\n\n4. Even if they don't choose rock, I have equal chances against the other options, so there's no downside to this strategy.\n\n5.

Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" (meaning they're new), I need to think about what a new player might do:\n   - New players often don't have a sophisticated strategy\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might have psychological biases (like choosing rock because it seems \"strong\")\n   - They might overthink and try to be clever\n\n3. Since this appears to be a single round (no information about previous rounds), I don't have any data about the opponent's patterns.\n\n4. In a pure game theory sense, the optimal strategy for rock-paper-scissors is to play each move with equal probability (1/3 each), making your play unpredictable.\n\n5. However, against a \"fresh player,\" there might be some psychological tendencies I can exploit:\n   - Many beginners tend to choose rock first (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Some people choose scissors thinking others will choose paper\n   - Paper is sometimes seen as the \"weakest\" option psychologically\n\n6. Given that this is against a fresh player, I think rock is statistically the most common first choice for new players. If they choose rock, I should choose paper to beat it.\n\n7.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
