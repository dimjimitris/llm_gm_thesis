If they play scissors, I need to play rock since rock beats scissors.\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (scissors gets -1, paper gets +1)\n- Rock beats paper (paper gets -1, rock gets +1) \n\n\n- Scissors beats rock (rock gets -1, scissors gets +1)\n\nI'll strategically choose rock to counter their potential scissors move, understanding the scoring implications of each possible outcome.",
