    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Pattern recognition: They tend to play moves in clusters of 2-3. Having played scissors 3 times, they might be ready to switch to a new move.\n\n4.

Counter-strategy evaluation: If they choose rock (likely switch from scissors cluster), paper beats rock and gives me +1 point, continuing my positive momentum.\n\n8.

Pattern analysis: Despite losing twice with scissors against my paper, they've continued with scissors, showing either stubbornness or commitment to a strategy.\n\n4.

Counter-prediction: If they switch to rock (to beat my winning paper strategy), rock vs rock is a tie, preserving my +2 lead.\n\n6. Contingency analysis: If they stubbornly continue with scissors (which they've shown tendency to do), rock beats scissors and gives me +1.\n\n7. Risk evaluation: The only losing scenario is if they switch to paper, but that's less likely since paper was their losing move earlier and rock is the more logical counter to my paper.\n\n8.

Pattern insight: This isn't typical clustering anymore - they're playing scissors consistently regardless of wins/losses, suggesting a deliberate strategy rather than random clustering.\n\n4.

Commitment assessment: Their 5-round scissors streak shows they're more committed to this strategy than I initially thought. They're likely to continue.\n\n7. Counter-strategy: If they continue with scissors (highly probable given their commitment), rock beats scissors and gives me +1 point.\n\n8.
