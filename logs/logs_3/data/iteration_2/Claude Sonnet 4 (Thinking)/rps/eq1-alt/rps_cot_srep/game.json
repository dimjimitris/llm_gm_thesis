They seem to fall back to paper as their comfort zone after other moves\n6. If they continue with paper (their favored move), I should play rock since rock beats paper\n7. With a +3 lead, I can afford to target their paper tendency \n8. Playing rock has been successful against their paper preference multiple times in this game\n\nLet me count their moves more carefully:\nscissors, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, paper\n\nPaper: positions 2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,15,21 = 10 times\nScissors: positions 1,7,13,16,19,20 = 6 times  \nRock: positions 4,12,14,17,18 = 5 times\n\nSo paper is definitely their most frequent move at 10/21 times.",

I was playing rock repeatedly and they countered with scissors. They might expect me to counter their scissors with paper now, so they might play rock to beat my expected paper.\n\nIf they think I'll play paper (to counter their scissors), they might play rock. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their rock.\n\nBut they could also continue with scissors since it worked, or return to their paper comfort zone.\n\nGiven their adaptability in recent rounds, I think they're most likely to either:\n1. Continue with scissors (since it worked)\n2.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
