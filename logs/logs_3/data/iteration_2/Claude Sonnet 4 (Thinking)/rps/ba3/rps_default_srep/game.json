Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only give +1 when they win. The risk is that paper also has the highest penalty (-3) when losing to scissors.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior information about their tendencies, and paper has the best expected value in a random scenario, I'll choose paper.

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this rock-paper-scissors game and the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nSo the payoff matrix from my perspective is:\n- If I play rock: beat scissors (+1), lose to paper (-3), tie with rock (0)\n- If I play paper: beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1), tie with paper (0)\n- If I play scissors: beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1), tie with scissors (0)\n\nInteresting - paper has the highest potential reward (+3) but also the highest potential penalty (-3). Rock and scissors have smaller rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\", I don't have any information about their tendencies or strategy. In a single game with no prior information, I need to think about:\n\n1. Expected value of each move assuming random opponent play (1/3 probability for each move)\n2. Risk considerations\n3. Psychological factors\n\nExpected values assuming random opponent:\n- Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1 + 0 = -2/3\n- Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1 - 1/3 + 0 = +2/3  \n- Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1/3 + 0 = 0\n\nSo paper has the highest expected value (+2/3), scissors is neutral (0), and rock is negative (-2/3).\n \nI notice a common human tendency to start with rock, which makes paper an even more strategic choice. Combining the mathematical advantage with this psychological insight, paper emerges as the optimal move.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
