    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This makes paper vs rock the highest stakes matchup.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: A \"fresh player\" likely hasn't developed complex strategies yet and may default to common first moves.\n\n3. Rock is often the most popular first choice for new players since it's mentioned first and feels \"strong.\"\n\n4. If my opponent chooses rock and I choose paper, I get the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Even if wrong, the worst case scenarios for paper are either a tie (0 points) or losing 1 point to scissors, which is less severe than losing 3 points.\n\n6. The risk-reward calculation favors paper against a potentially rock-heavy fresh player.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best combination of high reward potential and reasonable risk for a first move against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyze the previous round: My opponent chose scissors, showing they may think strategically rather than defaulting to rock like typical fresh players.\n\n2. Consider opponent's next move options: They might repeat scissors since it worked, or switch thinking I'll counter with rock.\n\n3. Evaluate my response options:\n   - If they repeat scissors and I play rock: I win +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper (expecting my rock) and I play rock: I lose -3 points\n   - If they switch to rock and I play rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n4. Consider the meta-game: Since scissors worked for them last round, there's a good chance they might stick with a winning strategy, at least for one more round.\n\n5. Rock directly counters scissors and gives me a solid +1 point win if they repeat their successful move.\n\n6. The risk is if they anticipated my counter and switched to paper, but the reward of beating repeated scissors makes this worthwhile.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock counters their previous winning move and gives me the best chance to recover from the -1 deficit.\n\n[move] rock"
