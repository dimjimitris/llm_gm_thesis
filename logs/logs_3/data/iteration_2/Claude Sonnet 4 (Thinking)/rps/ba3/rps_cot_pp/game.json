This makes paper vs rock the highest stakes matchup.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: A \"fresh player\" likely hasn't developed complex strategies yet and may default to common first moves.\n\n3. Rock is often the most popular first choice for new players since it's mentioned first and feels \"strong.\"\n\n4. If my opponent chooses rock and I choose paper, I get the maximum possible reward of +3 points.\n\n5. Even if wrong, the worst case scenarios for paper are either a tie (0 points) or losing 1 point to scissors, which is less severe than losing 3 points.\n\n6.

Consider the meta-game: Since scissors worked for them last round, there's a good chance they might stick with a winning strategy, at least for one more round.\n\n5.
