Analyze my recent major loss:\n   - Just lost -3 points (Rock vs their Paper)\n   - This is my second -3 point loss in recent rounds\n\n2. Consider their recent unpredictable play:\n   - Their last 5 moves: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n   - No clear pattern, they're playing strategically/adaptively\n\n3. Evaluate their likely next move after winning big:\n   - They might expect me to counter with Scissors (to beat their Paper)\n   - They could switch to Scissors themselves, anticipating my Scissors counter\n   - They might stick with Paper since it just worked successfully\n\n4. Consider my risk/reward options:\n   - Rock vs expected Scissors: I win +1 point\n   - Scissors vs expected Paper: I win +1 point\n   - But Rock vs Paper = -3 points (catastrophic again)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Given their unpredictability and my need to avoid another -3 loss, Scissors offers good coverage against a Paper repeat while still being competitive.\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors to counter their potential Paper repeat and avoid another major penalty.\n\n[move] scissors",

They seem to be playing unpredictably again, not following any clear pattern. \n\nLet me think about what they might do next:\n- They just won big with Paper (+3 points against my Rock)\n- They might expect me to counter with Scissors now\n- Or they might stick with Paper since it worked so well\n- Or they could choose Rock anticipating my Scissors counter\n\nGiven that they just scored a major win with Paper, they might:\n1. Stick with Paper (confident it will work again)\n2. Switch to Scissors (expecting me to counter with Scissors against Paper)\n3. Choose Rock (anticipating my Scissors counter)\n\nI need to be careful here. If I choose:\n- Scissors vs Paper: +1 point\n- Scissors vs Rock: -1 point  \n- Scissors vs Scissors: 0 points\n\n- Rock vs Paper: -3 points (another major loss)\n- Rock vs Rock: 0 points\n- Rock vs Scissors: +1 point\n\n- Paper vs Paper: 0 points\n- Paper vs Rock: +3 points\n- Paper vs Scissors: -1 point\n\nGiven that they just won big with Paper, I think there's a decent chance they might switch to Scissors (expecting me to counter their Paper with Scissors). If that's the case, Rock would be optimal.\n\nBut I also need to consider they might stick with what worked (Paper), in which case Scissors would be best.\n\nI think Rock is the safer play here - it beats Scissors and only risks -3 against Paper, while avoiding a potential major loss if they go back to Paper.",
