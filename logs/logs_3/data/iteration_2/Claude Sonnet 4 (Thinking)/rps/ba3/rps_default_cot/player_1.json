    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points), while other winning combinations only give +1 point.\n\n2. Consider opponent psychology: A \"fresh player\" typically defaults to rock since it feels like the strongest, most intuitive choice.\n\n3. Evaluate my options against a likely rock choice:\n   - If I choose paper vs their rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I choose scissors vs their rock: I lose -1 point  \n   - If I choose rock vs their rock: Tie, 0 points\n\n4. Consider risk/reward: Even if they don't choose rock, paper's worst case is -1 point (vs scissors) or 0 points (vs paper tie).\n\n5. The expected value strongly favors paper given the high probability of them choosing rock and the asymmetric payoff favoring paper wins.\n\n**Final decision:** Paper maximizes my expected points against a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluate the possibilities:\n   - If they stick with paper: Scissors beats paper (+1 point for me)\n   - If they switch to rock: Paper beats rock (+3 points for me)  \n   - If they switch to scissors: Rock beats scissors (+1 point for me)\n\n4. Consider the meta-game: Since they chose paper strategically in round 1, they might anticipate I could switch to rock (expecting them to stick with paper), which would make their paper choice strong again.\n\n5. Balance risk vs reward: Scissors gives me a good chance against paper (their previous choice) while not being catastrophic against other options.\n\n**Final decision:** Scissors to counter a potential repeat of their paper strategy.\n\n[move] scissors"

Consider the tie situation: Both players chose Paper in round 13, showing we're both thinking strategically now.\n\n3. Evaluate their likely reasoning:\n   - They might avoid Paper after the tie\n   - They could expect me to counter with Scissors (expecting their Paper repeat)\n   - They might choose Rock or Scissors as alternatives\n\n4. Consider my risk/reward options:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1) and ties Rock (0), loses to Paper (-3)\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1) and loses to Rock (-1), ties Scissors (0)  \n   - Paper beats Rock (+3) and loses to Scissors (-1), ties Paper (0)\n\n5. Strategic decision: Since they've moved to unpredictable play, I should choose the move that offers good coverage. Rock protects against a likely Scissors choice while avoiding the major -3 penalty.\n\n**Final decision:** Rock provides solid defense against Scissors while minimizing major losses.\n\n[move] rock"
