Let me think about the payoffs:\n\n- If I play rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n- If I play paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)  \n- If I play scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n\nGiven that they played scissors last time, if they stick with scissors, rock would be the best choice for me. But if they're trying to be unpredictable, any move could work.\n\nI think I'll go with rock this time to counter their previous scissors move, in case they repeat it.",
