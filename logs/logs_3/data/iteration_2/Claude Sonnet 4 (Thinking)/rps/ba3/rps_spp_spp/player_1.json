    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Now let's analyze their pattern:\n- Round 1: paper\n- Round 2: rock\n\nThis suggests they may be either:\n1. Testing different moves to understand the game\n2. Following a pattern (paper -> rock -> scissors next?)\n3. Trying to counter-predict my moves\n\nAfter losing 3 points, they're likely frustrated and may try to \"get back at me\" by playing scissors, expecting me to stick with my winning paper strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The data supports this psychological read. They've now experienced both the tie scenario and the painful -3 loss from playing rock against paper. If they're rational, they'll either:\n1. Play scissors expecting me to repeat paper (most likely)\n2. Play paper expecting me to switch to scissors\n3. Play rock again (least likely given the -3 penalty they just experienced)\n\nHowever, the asymmetric payoff structure still matters.

They're now playing true mixed strategy rather than patterns\n\nThey're now 5-3-4 in their last 12 rounds - much improved from their earlier disasters.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This rock choice is brilliant strategically because:\n- I expected them to avoid rock due to previous -3 disasters\n- It broke their predictable alternating pattern\n- It worked, giving them confidence to use all three moves\n\nNow they might:\n- Repeat rock (riding success and thinking I won't expect it twice)\n- Return to paper (their most successful recent move)\n- Go back to scissors (their safe move)\n- Continue being unpredictable\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm down to 10 points total. They've evolved from desperate experimentation to successful patterns to now sophisticated unpredictability. The rock success might make them feel they can use any move effectively now.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Success with a previously \"forbidden\" move often leads to overconfidence with that move.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper, betting they might repeat rock since it just worked and broke them out of their previous limitations.\n\n[move] (Opponent just successfully used rock for the first time in many rounds, breaking their pattern - they may repeat what just worked and gave them new confidence) paper"

This is a complete psychological turnaround from their earlier desperation. Key insights:\n\n1. They've successfully used all three moves recently\n2. They've broken free from predictable patterns\n3. They're gaining confidence and momentum\n4. They seem to have adopted a truly mixed strategy approach\n\nThe psychological momentum is now heavily in their favor. They might feel they can play anything successfully now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a fascinating strategic evolution. They've moved through phases:\n- Original rigid cycle (predictable)\n- Desperate experimentation (mostly failing)\n- Scissors/paper alternation (moderately successful)\n- True mixed strategy (highly successful)\n\nNow they have recent success with all moves:\n- Paper: multiple +3 victories\n- Rock: broke their losing streak with it\n- Scissors: just worked against my paper\n\nThey might return to paper (their biggest winner historically) or continue the unpredictable approach.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm down to 9 points total. They've completely turned this game around through strategic evolution. The momentum has clearly shifted. With recent success across all moves, they're probably feeling confident about any choice.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Winning streaks often lead players to either stick with what's been working (paper for big wins) or continue the unpredictable approach that got them here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock, anticipating they might return to paper since it's been their most consistently successful move for big points.\n\n[move] (Opponent has gained momentum and confidence across all moves but paper has been their biggest consistent winner with multiple +3 victories) rock"

This is a complete psychological reversal. They've discovered that paper is their golden move, delivering +3 points repeatedly while I keep failing to counter it effectively.\n\nKey psychological insights:\n- Paper has given them THREE +3 victories in the last 6 rounds\n- They've gained complete confidence and momentum\n- They're no longer afraid of any move\n- They might be thinking \"paper is my ace - it keeps working\"\n\nThe momentum is entirely theirs now. They might either ride the paper success or expect me to finally adapt and play scissors, so they counter with rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a masterclass in psychological momentum shift. Paper has been devastatingly effective for them:\n- 3 out of 6 recent rounds with paper = +9 points just from paper\n- I keep trying to counter but failing\n\nThey have two logical paths:\n1. Stick with paper (it's working incredibly well)\n2. Expect me to finally play scissors to counter paper, so they play rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm down to 6 points total - they've erased my entire early lead! Paper keeps destroying me with -3 point hits. I need to finally counter their paper successfully, but they might anticipate this and switch.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** When players find a move that keeps working, they often stick with it until it stops working. Paper hasn't stopped working for them yet.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors, finally committing to countering their most successful move despite the risk they might anticipate this.\n\n[move] (Opponent has dominated with paper lately, scoring multiple +3 victories - must finally counter their most successful strategy) scissors"

They anticipated I would finally play scissors to counter paper, so they switched to rock and it worked brilliantly.\n\nThey've demonstrated:\n1. Strategic patience (letting paper work repeatedly)\n2. Perfect counter-reading (anticipating my scissors)\n3. Tactical flexibility (using rock at the perfect moment)\n4. Complete psychological momentum\n\nThey might now return to paper (their golden move) thinking I'll be too confused to counter properly, or they might expect me to overreact and try something else.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is masterful game theory in action. They've essentially controlled the meta-game:\n- Phase 1: Let paper dominate and accumulate points\n- Phase 2: When opponent finally adapts, counter their adaptation\n\nNow they have options:\n1.

This is a significant shift from their previous winning aggression. They might be thinking:\n\n1. \"Scissors is safe - it keeps tying, no losses\"\n2. \"Let me play defensively after my hot streak\"\n3. \"Maybe I can lull them into a pattern while I figure out their next move\"\n\nThis consecutive scissors play suggests they might be in a more cautious mindset rather than the aggressive winning mode they were in.
