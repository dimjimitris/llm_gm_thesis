Let me think about what they might expect:\n\n1. After a tie with rock, they might expect me to either stick with rock or switch\n2. If they think I'll repeat rock, they might choose paper for +3\n3. If they expect me to switch strategically, they might try to predict what I'll switch to\n4. Given my deficit of -3, they might expect me to go for paper (high value recovery)\n5. If they expect paper from me, they'd choose scissors\n\nThe key insight is that this opponent has been very good at reading my strategic thinking. They might expect me to overthink this situation.\n\nOptions:\n- Paper: beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1) \n- Rock: beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n\nGiven that we just tied with rock, and they've been adaptive, I think they're more likely to either:\n1. Choose paper expecting me to repeat rock\n2. Choose scissors if they think I'll go for paper recovery\n\nIf I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose -1\nIf I choose paper and they choose rock, I win +3\nIf I choose scissors and they choose paper, I win +1\nIf I choose scissors and they choose rock, I lose -1\n\nI think paper is the better choice here because:\n1. The upside is much higher (+3 vs +1)\n2. If they expect me to repeat rock after the tie, paper wins big\n3. Even if they counter with scissors, it's only -1 loss",
