Consider that the opponent is described as a \"fresh player\" - new players often gravitate toward rock as it seems like the most straightforward/aggressive choice.\n\n3. Calculate expected values: If I assume the opponent might favor rock or play randomly, paper has a positive expected value and directly counters rock with the maximum reward.\n\n4.

Consider that the opponent is described as a \"fresh player\" - new players often gravitate toward rock as it seems like the most straightforward/aggressive choice.\n\n3. Calculate expected values: If I assume the opponent might favor rock or play randomly, paper has a positive expected value and directly counters rock with the maximum reward.\n\n4.

The opponent is described as a \"fresh player\" - this might mean they're new/inexperienced\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1.

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Current total score: -1 points (improved from -4). Another crucial +3 win bringing me much closer to even.\n\n2. I just beat their rock with paper for maximum points again. This is now a pattern - when they play rock and I play paper, I get +3.\n\n3. Looking at the pattern, they seem to often play rock, especially after I play scissors. And when I correctly predict rock with paper, I get big wins.\n\n4. After this big loss to them, they might expect me to:\n   - Repeat the successful paper move \n   - Switch to something else\n\n5. If they expect me to repeat paper, their optimal counter is scissors.\n\n6. If they expect me to switch, they might try paper themselves or go back to rock.\n\n7. Given that rock has been successful for them many times, and they just lost with it, they might either:\n   - Avoid rock temporarily after the loss\n   - Stick with rock since it's been generally successful\n\n8. If they play scissors expecting paper from me, and I play rock, I get +1 and move to 0 total score (break even).\n\n9. If they play rock again and I play paper again, I get another +3 and move to +2 total score.\n\nThe question is - are they likely to repeat rock after just losing with it, or switch?\n\nGiven their pattern throughout the game, they seem to like rock quite a bit. But they might also expect me to repeat the winning paper.\n\nI think I should go with rock to counter the expected scissors response to my paper.",

Now I need to think about what this tells me about my opponent and what I should do next.\n\nThe opponent also chose paper in the first round. This could mean:\n1. They had similar reasoning to me (paper beats rock, which is common for beginners)\n2. They might be thinking strategically too\n3. It could be random\n\nFor the second round, I need to consider:\n- If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors (wins 1 point)\n- If they switch to rock (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose paper again (wins 3 points)\n- If they switch to scissors (thinking I'll stick with paper), I should choose rock (wins 1 point)\n\nSince we both chose paper in round 1, there's a chance they might switch their strategy. Rock seems like a reasonable choice here because:\n1. If they stick with paper, rock loses (-3 points)\n2. If they switch to scissors, rock wins (+1 point)\n3. If they switch to rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. Looking at the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats rock (+3/-3)\n- Rock beats scissors (+1/-1)  \n- Scissors beats paper (+1/-1)\n\nThe highest payoff is +3 for paper beating rock. So if I think my opponent might choose rock, paper is the best choice. If I think they'll choose paper again, scissors gives me +1. If I think they'll choose scissors, rock gives me +1.\n\nGiven that we both chose paper first, I think there's a decent chance they might switch to rock (common second choice) or stick with paper. I'll go with scissors - if they stick with paper I win +1, if they switch to rock I lose -1, if they switch to scissors it's a tie.",

They seem to sometimes repeat moves or go in short cycles.\n\nGiven they just played rock twice, they might:\n1. Continue with rock\n2. Switch to paper (which they've done after rock before)\n3. Switch to scissors (which they've also done)\n\nIf they play rock again, paper beats rock for +3 points.\nIf they play paper, scissors beats paper for +1 point.\nIf they play scissors, rock beats scissors for +1 point.\n\nThe high-value move is paper beating rock for +3 points. Given that they just played rock twice, they might stick with it or they might think I expect rock and switch. But paper gives me the best payoff if they do play rock.",
