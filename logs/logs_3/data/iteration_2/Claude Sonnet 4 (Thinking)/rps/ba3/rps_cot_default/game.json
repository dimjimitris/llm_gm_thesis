Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points) but also the highest penalty if I lose (-3 points)\n2. Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give moderate rewards (1 point) with moderate penalties (-1 point)\n3. This creates an asymmetric payoff structure\n\nSteps to consider:\n\n1. Analyze the risk-reward of each move:\n   - Playing rock: Can win 1 point vs scissors, lose 3 points vs paper, tie vs rock\n   - Playing paper: Can win 3 points vs rock, lose 1 point vs scissors, tie vs paper  \n   - Playing scissors: Can win 1 point vs paper, lose 1 point vs rock, tie vs scissors\n\n2. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - They might not have a strategy yet\n   - They might choose randomly\n   - They might go with a common first choice (rock is often popular as a first move)\n\n3. Evaluate expected values if opponent plays randomly:\n   - If I play rock: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-3) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1 = -2/3\n   - If I play paper: (1/3)*3 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3  \n   - If I play scissors: (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*0 = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n   \nPaper emerges as the optimal choice.

      "reasoning_text": "Interesting! The other player also played paper. This gives me some information about their strategy. Let me think step-by-step:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. The opponent also played paper in round 1, which suggests they might have similar reasoning to mine - either they're thinking about the payoff structure or they made a common choice.\n\n2. Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2. They could:\n   - Stick with paper (thinking it's a good strategy)\n   - Switch to rock (to counter if they think I'll play paper again)\n   - Switch to scissors (to counter if they think I'll play paper again)\n   - Play randomly\n\n3. Let me think about the psychology here. Since we both played paper and tied, they might think:\n   - \"They played paper too, maybe they'll stick with it\" - leading them to play scissors\n   - \"Let me try something different\" - leading them to play rock or scissors\n   - \"Paper worked well last time\" - leading them to stick with paper\n\n4. If I assume they're likely to either stick with paper or switch to scissors (to beat paper), then:\n   - If they play paper again: tie (0 points)\n   - If they play scissors: rock beats scissors (+1 point)\n   - If they play rock: paper beats rock (+3 points)\n\n5. Rock seems like a good choice because:\n   - It beats scissors (which they might play to counter my potential paper)\n   - If they stick with paper, I lose 3 points, but if they switch to scissors, I win 1 point\n   - Actually wait, let me recalculate this...\n\nLet me reconsider the payoffs:\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point  \n- If I play rock and they play rock: tie (0 points)\n\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n\n\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play paper: tie (0 points)\n\n- If I play scissors and they play paper: I win 1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play rock: I lose 1 point\n- If I play scissors and they play scissors: tie (0 points)\n\nI'm analyzing their potential strategy carefully. Their previous paper move suggests they might switch to scissors, which makes rock an attractive option. This could give me a strategic advantage by potentially winning 1 point if they choose scissors.\n\nHowever, the expected value calculations reveal paper as the most promising move. By assuming equal probability across moves, paper provides the best potential outcome at 2/3 points expected.\n\nAnticipating my opponent's potential strategy of countering my previous paper play with scissors, I recognize rock would effectively neutralize that approach.",
