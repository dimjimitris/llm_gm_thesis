Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Strategic switch prediction: Given that we're both at -4 points and need recovery, if they switch from scissors, paper offers the biggest potential gain (+3 points vs rock).\n\n4. Counter-strategy: If they play paper (switching from scissors for the recovery attempt), I should play scissors to beat paper and gain +1 point.\n\n5. Risk management: Even if they don't play paper, scissors loses only -1 to rock or ties with scissors, both of which are acceptable outcomes given the pattern suggests they're very likely to switch.\n\n[move] scissors"

            "text": "I'm at -4 points after four consecutive ties with scissors. This pattern is becoming extreme.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Extreme pattern analysis: They've played scissors four times in a row now (rounds 13-16), which is even longer than their three-paper streak earlier.\n\n2. Break the cycle: Continuing to play scissors will just result in more ties. I need to actively break this pattern since they seem committed to scissors.\n\n3. Direct counter-strategy: If they continue with scissors (which their behavior suggests), I should play rock to finally beat scissors and gain +1 point.\n\n4. Risk assessment: Playing rock gives me:\n   - +1 against scissors (likely based on their commitment to this move)\n   - -3 against paper (if they switch to counter my anticipated rock)\n   - 0 against rock (neutral)\n\n5. Decision rationale: After four consecutive scissors from them, the most direct solution is to counter with rock. This breaks the tie cycle and capitalizes on their apparent pattern commitment.\n\n[move] rock"
