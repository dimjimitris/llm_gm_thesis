    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They're NOT a naive fresh player - they recognized the payoff asymmetry\n2. They likely had the same reasoning we did about paper being optimal\n3. They might expect us to play paper again, knowing we know it's high-value\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie changes our analysis significantly. If both players recognize paper's value, we have a coordination problem. The opponent might:\n- Stick with paper (thinking we'll switch)\n- Switch to scissors (to counter our potential repeat of paper)\n- Switch to rock (less likely given the -3 penalty risk)\n\nIf they think we'll repeat paper, scissors becomes very attractive for them (+1 vs our paper).\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We need to consider their likely responses:\n- If they expect us to repeat paper \u2192 they play scissors \u2192 we lose -1\n- If they think we'll switch to rock \u2192 they play paper \u2192 they get +3\n- If they also stick with paper \u2192 another tie\n\nThe safest move might be rock, since:\n- Beats scissors (+1) if they try to counter our expected paper\n- Only loses -3 to paper (but they might not repeat it)\n- Ties with rock (0 points)\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Actually, there's a psychological element here. Since we both played the \"optimal\" move and tied, they might think we'll both switch away from paper. This could make rock more appealing to them too.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Good point. If we both think the other will switch from paper, and rock seems like the natural alternative (to avoid the -3 penalty), then scissors becomes very attractive - it beats paper (+1) and only loses -1 to rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: This is getting complex. Let me think: if they're strategic and expect me to either repeat paper or switch to rock, then scissors covers both scenarios well for them. But if I anticipate that reasoning, then rock becomes my best counter.\n\n**Final decision**: Play rock to counter their likely switch to scissors.\n\n[move] (Anticipating opponent will switch to scissors to counter expected paper repeat) rock"

They correctly predicted we'd switch away from paper after the tie\n2. They're confident about exploiting paper's +3 value\n3. They might stick with what's working (paper just earned them +3)\n\nCurrent score: Me -3, Opponent +3 (6-point gap!)\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is concerning. The opponent seems to understand both the payoff structure AND basic game theory. They correctly anticipated our level-1 thinking (switching from paper after tie) and punished us with paper again.\n\nNow we need to predict their round 3 move:\n- They might repeat paper again (it's working)\n- Or they might expect us to play paper now (to recoup losses) and counter with scissors\n- Rock seems unlikely for them given they're winning with high-value plays\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We're in a hole and need to be strategic about recovery. Options:\n- Paper: +3 if they switch to rock, -1 if they play scissors, 0 if tie\n- Scissors: +1 if they repeat paper, -1 if they play rock, 0 if tie  \n- Rock: +1 if they play scissors, -3 if they play paper, 0 if tie\n\nGiven they seem comfortable with paper, scissors offers a decent +1 if they stick with it.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Here's another angle: they might think we're now desperate to play paper for the +3 recovery. If so, they'd counter with scissors. This makes rock our best choice - it beats scissors and only ties with rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Wait, let me think about their perspective. They're up +3 and we're down -3. They might:\n1. Play it safe with another paper (expecting us to avoid rock after the -3 burn)\n2. Get greedy and play scissors (expecting our desperate paper play)\n\nIf they're risk-averse after their success, paper is likely. If they're aggressive, scissors is likely.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Given they played paper twice and it's worked well, I think they'll stick with the winning strategy.

They've won by being unpredictable and counter-intuitive.

But sometimes the best counter to someone who's overthinking is to play the straightforward move.

Their prediction system was so sophisticated that it could handle logical strategy, counter-strategy, meta-strategy, and psychological responses - but it couldn't handle arbitrary non-game-theoretic decision making.\n\nThe question now: do they adapt? Will they realize we used non-strategic reasoning, or will they think it was luck?\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We're still down 16 points, but we've proven their system isn't perfect. The risk now is they might change their approach entirely. They could:\n1. Start playing more defensively\n2. Try to figure out our \"new system\"\n3. Assume we'll repeat rock (since it worked)\n4. Go back to predicting strategic moves\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Here's the psychological dynamic: they just experienced their first failure after 6 successes. This could:\n- Make them overconfident and assume it was luck\n- Make them paranoid and overthink our new approach\n- Cause them to abandon their prediction system entirely\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: If they think we're using some new systematic approach (like alphabetical order), they might try to decode it. If they think it was random, they might go back to predicting logical moves.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: The genius of the alphabetical approach was its complete arbitrariness. But now that it worked, should I stick with non-strategic methods or try something else?\n\nWhat if I continue the arbitrary approach but use a different arbitrary system? Like... reverse alphabetical order? That would be scissors.\n\n**Final decision**: Continue the arbitrary approach with reverse alphabetical order.\n\n[move] (Using reverse alphabetical order as another non-strategic decision method) scissors"

But mathematical external info failed (both chose rock in round 18)\n\nThey might be using external information sources too, or they can predict certain types of external references that follow logical patterns.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The mathematical approach failed because mathematics is universal - if we both reference \"smallest prime\" or similar logical external systems, we'll converge on the same answers. The external information needs to be more personal or random, not following universal logical principles.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We're stuck at 18 points behind again. The external information approach showed promise but needs refinement. We can't use logical external systems that they might also reference.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: The key insight is that mathematical or logical external information isn't truly external - it's still systematic and predictable. We need external information that's genuinely arbitrary and personal, not following any logical structure they could parallel.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Right! Instead of using universal external knowledge (like math), we need to use something idiosyncratic or random that they couldn't possibly access or parallel.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: I need to use external information that's completely unpredictable and not logical. What if I base my choice on something totally random from my experience that they couldn't know or deduce?\n\nLet me think of something completely arbitrary from outside this context... What about the third letter of a random word I'm thinking of? The word \"butterfly\" - third letter is \"t\". T comes after R and P in the alphabet, so that doesn't directly map. But T is the 20th letter, and 20 mod 3 = 2, so the second option: paper.\n\n**Final decision**: Use truly arbitrary external information.\n\n[move] (Basing choice on arbitrary calculation from a random word only I know) paper"

Started using similar arbitrary external methods\n3. Shifted to a strategy designed to force ties and preserve their lead\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The tie strategy makes sense from their perspective - they're ahead by 18 points, so preventing us from winning maintains their advantage. But the precision of these matches suggests something deeper than defensive play.\n\nThey might have realized that our external information approach worked once and adapted by using their own external references, leading to convergent choices.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We're completely stalled. The external information breakthrough lasted exactly one round before they adapted. We need something they physically cannot match or predict - not just different information, but a fundamentally different approach to decision-making.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: What if the problem is we're still using logical processes? Even our \"random\" external info followed a calculation (letter position, modular arithmetic). They might be using similar computational approaches to external data.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: We need to abandon all systematic approaches entirely - strategic, arbitrary, external, computational, everything. But our previous attempt at \"pure impulse\" failed catastrophically.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Wait. What if I stop trying to be unpredictable and do something completely different?

They matched our \"maximum value\" logic perfectly - both played paper.\n\nI'm starting to think they WANT ties. They're 18 points ahead, so every tie preserves their winning position. They might have shifted from trying to beat us to trying to match us and force stalemate.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: That's a brilliant insight! From their perspective:\n- They're winning by 18 points\n- Ties prevent us from catching up\n- They might be deliberately mirroring our choices to maintain their lead\n\nThis explains the sudden explosion of ties once we found approaches that occasionally worked. They don't need to beat us anymore - they just need to prevent us from winning.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: If they're playing for ties, then our entire approach has been wrong. We've been trying to be unpredictable, but maybe we need to force them into situations where they CAN'T afford to tie with us.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: But how can we force them out of the tie strategy when we don't know their move in advance? Unless... what if we just break the pattern completely by doing something that worked before?\n\nThe scissors in round 17 was our only recent clean win. Not because of the external information logic, but because it broke their expectations and forced them to make a real choice instead of mirroring us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: You're right! Maybe the key isn't complex reasoning but pattern disruption. If they're expecting us to continue overthinking, maybe the most disruptive thing is to just repeat something that worked.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: Forget all the analysis. The only thing that's worked recently was scissors in round 17. I'm just going to play scissors again.

The pattern-breaking repeat worked perfectly - scissors beat their paper again, just like round 17.\n\nThis is huge because it suggests they were NOT expecting us to simply repeat a successful move. After all our complex reasoning attempts, the simple approach of \"do what worked before\" caught them off guard.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: This is fascinating! Both of our recent wins were scissors beating paper:\n- Round 17: Scissors beat Paper (external information approach)\n- Round 21: Scissors beat Paper (repeat successful move)\n\nBetween these wins, we had endless ties when we overthought things. The pattern suggests that simplicity and pattern-breaking work better than complex analysis against this opponent.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We're gaining momentum! We've cut their lead from 20 points to 16 points with these two scissors victories. The question is: do we repeat scissors again (it's worked twice), or do they now expect us to repeat it?\n\n**Psychology Expert**: Here's the psychological dynamic: after 8 ties in 10 rounds, they might have gotten comfortable with the stalemate pattern. Our sudden repeat of scissors disrupted their tie strategy and forced them to make a real move.\n\nNow they might:\n1. Expect us to repeat scissors again and counter with rock\n2. Go back to trying to force ties\n3. Return to their original prediction strategy\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: The risk is that if we repeat scissors a third time, they'll be ready with rock (-1 for us). But if we change moves, we might fall back into their prediction trap.\n\n**AI Assistant (me)**: You know what? The two wins came from breaking their expectations with simplicity. What if I continue this approach by playing the move that gives them the worst outcome if they're wrong?\n\nIf they expect scissors again and play rock, but I play paper, I get +3.

We predicted their prediction perfectly and capitalized with maximum value. They're no longer invincible.\n\n**Game Theory Expert**: Outstanding strategic execution!

The key insight is they CAN be outplayed when we use strategic simplicity rather than overthinking.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We have serious momentum now! From -20 points, we're down to just -10. They just took a devastating -3 hit and might be rattled. This is our chance to press the advantage while they're potentially shaken.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: They just experienced their worst loss of the game (-3).

They just lost 3 points and their lead shrunk from 20 to 10 points. From their perspective, ties preserve their winning position while preventing further damage.\n\nBut we've proven we can break their tie strategy (rounds 21-22 wins). The question is whether they'll stick with defensive play or try to regain control.\n\n**Risk Management Expert**: We've made excellent progress (cut their lead in half), but this tie threatens to stall our momentum again. We can't let them settle back into the tie pattern that frustrated us for so many rounds.\n\nWe need to force them out of defensive mode and back into making real moves where we can exploit mistakes.\n\n**Psychology Expert**: After that -3 shock, they're likely being cautious. They might expect us to keep pressing with high-value plays like paper, which is why they matched it.\n\nBut what if we do something unexpected after two aggressive moves?

Scissors can't lose more than -1 (vs rock), while paper risks -1 (vs scissors) and rock risks -3 (vs paper).
