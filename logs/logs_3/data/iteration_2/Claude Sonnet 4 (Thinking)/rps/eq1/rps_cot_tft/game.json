The payoff structure is:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 for me, -1 for them) \n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 for me, -1 for them)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both\n\n3. Since this is against a fresh player with no prior information, I need to think about what might be a good opening strategy.\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors, there's no inherently \"best\" move since it's a game of pure strategy with no dominant strategy. However, there are some psychological tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to play rock first (it's the first option mentioned, feels \"strong\")\n   - Some might overthink and go with paper to beat the expected rock\n   - Scissors is often the least chosen initially\n\n5. Given that this is a fresh player, rock is statistically the most common first move among beginners.\n\n6. If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper to beat it and get +1 points.\n\n7. However, I should also consider that they might be thinking the same way (expecting me to expect rock) and choose paper themselves, in which case I'd want scissors.\n\n8. But this could lead to infinite recursion of thinking. For a first move against a fresh player, I'll go with the statistical approach: assume they're likely to play rock, so I'll play paper.\n\nFinal decision: Paper",
