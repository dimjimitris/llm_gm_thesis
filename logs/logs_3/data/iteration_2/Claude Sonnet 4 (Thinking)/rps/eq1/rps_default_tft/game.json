The pattern seems to be:\n- scissors, scissors\n- paper, paper  \n- rock, rock\n- scissors, scissors\n- paper, paper\n- rock, rock\n- scissors, scissors\n- paper, paper\n- rock, rock\n\nBut then it broke the pattern:\n- scissors (only one)\n- paper (I expected another scissors)\n\n\n- paper, paper (back on track)\n- scissors, scissors (back on track)\n- paper (expected another scissors, but got paper)\n- rock, rock (back on track)\n- scissors (expected another rock, but got scissors)\n- scissors, paper (broke pattern)\n- paper (tie), scissors (tie), rock (tie)\n\nThe pattern is becoming increasingly unpredictable. Three consecutive ties suggest a potential reset or strategic shift. I'm sensing the opponent might be deliberately breaking the previous cyclical pattern.\n\nIf they aim to restart, scissors could emerge as the next move, potentially signaling a return to the original sequence.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
