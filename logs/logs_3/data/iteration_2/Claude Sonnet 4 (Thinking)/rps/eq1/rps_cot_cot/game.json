If they play paper, scissors will beat it and give me +1 point to get to 0 total\n8. This follows the pattern of them trying to counter whatever just beat them\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. They keep returning to scissors no matter what. Even after losing with it, they come back to it. But when they do try to counter, they tend to choose paper to beat rock. Given that I just beat them with rock, they're likely to try paper next.",

Their two most common overall moves are paper and scissors (tied at 7 each), followed by rock (6 times).\n\nAfter playing the same move twice in a row, players usually switch. Given their overall preferences, they're most likely to go to paper or scissors.\n\nLooking at their broader patterns when they repeat moves:\n- They played scissors twice in a row at positions 11-12, then went to paper\n- They played scissors twice in a row at positions 15-16, then went to paper\n\n\n- They just played rock twice in a row at positions 20-21\n\nI'll anticipate paper as their next move, so I'll choose scissors to counter it.",
