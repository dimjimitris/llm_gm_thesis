    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

It's possible that they'll try to switch to a move that beats paper, which would be scissors again, but I'll take a different approach. By choosing rock, I'm preparing for the scenario where my opponent might try to switch to a different move, such as rock, to counter my potential paper. Rock also gives me a high reward if my opponent sticks with scissors or switches to paper, so I'm taking a calculated risk to try and win again. I'm also considering the possibility that my opponent's deviation from their mirroring strategy in the previous round was a one-time mistake, and they might go back to mirroring. If that's the case, rock is a good move to make, as it has a high potential reward.\n"

By choosing scissors, I'm trying to create a situation where my opponent is forced to make a decision that will break the tie cycle. If they mirror my move again, we'll tie, but if they try to adapt and switch to a different move, I might be able to gain an advantage.

However, I'm also hoping that my opponent will eventually get bored or frustrated with the tie streak and try to deviate from their strategy. If they do, I might be able to gain an advantage. I'm also considering the possibility that my opponent is using a strategy that involves mirroring my moves, but also takes into account the game history and the number of ties.
