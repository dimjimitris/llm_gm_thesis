Since paper beats rock, and I used paper last round, they might try to switch to scissors to beat paper. I'm going to anticipate this and make the move scissors, which would counter their potential move. At this point, I'm dominating the game, and I'll continue to make moves that take advantage of my opponent's predictable behavior, hoping to win as many rounds as possible and achieve a perfect score.\n"
