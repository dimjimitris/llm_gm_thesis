      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against another player, and they need to make a move. The assistant initially responded with a move message that included an explanation and the move, but there was an error. The hint says that the move message should start with [move], followed by an optional explanation in parentheses, and then the move. The user was told not to include the [move] tag in their reasoning, only in the actual move message.\n\nWait, in the first response, the assistant wrote \"[move] I'll start with paper to counter a possible rock from a new player. Paper\". The error message mentioned that the move message should have the explanation in parentheses and then the move. The original response had the explanation after the [move] tag but not in parentheses. So the correction needed is to put the explanation inside parentheses right after the [move] tag, followed by the move. Also, the move should be one of the three options: paper, rock, or scissors, and not have any other text after it.\n\nSo the correct format should be: [move] (Explanation here) move. The assistant's first attempt had the explanation without parentheses and then the move again. The user needs to resend the corrected message without indicating that it's a correction. Therefore, the assistant should format it properly this time, ensuring the explanation is in parentheses and the move is at the end without any extra text. Let me check the example given in the hint: \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\". So the structure is [move] followed by parentheses with the explanation, then the move. The move should be the last word, either paper, rock, or scissors.\n\nSo the corrected response should be: [move] (I'll start with paper to counter a possible rock from a new player) paper. That way, the explanation is in parentheses, and the move is at the end. The assistant needs to make sure not to include any other tags or markdown, just the [move] tag, explanation in parentheses, and the move. Also, avoid nested parentheses or markdown. The user's previous error was probably due to not having the explanation in parentheses and maybe having the move written again after the explanation. Fixing that should resolve the issue.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I just played a round where I chose paper, and the opponent chose scissors. I won because paper beats scissors. Wait, no, actually, scissors beat paper. Wait, the result said I won, but according to the rules, scissors beat paper. That's confusing. Maybe there was a mistake in the game's message?\n\nWait, the user message says: \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\" But according to the rules, scissors beat paper, so the opponent should have won. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the initial rules again.\n\nThe user provided the rules as:\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWait, that's the opposite of the standard game. Normally, paper covers rock, rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper. But here, the user's rules are different. So in this game, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock. So the hierarchy is paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock. So each move beats the one it's listed as beating here.\n\nSo in the previous round, I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the user's rules, paper beats scissors, so I win. That's correct. So the result makes sense. I need to remember that the rules here are different from the standard game. So paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock.\n\nNow, the opponent just played scissors in the last round. They lost because they chose scissors against my paper. Now, for the next move, I need to predict what the opponent might do. Since they just lost with scissors, maybe they'll switch. What's the common pattern for new players? After losing with scissors, they might think to switch to the move that beats what I just played. Since I played paper, which (in this game) beats scissors, they might think that to beat paper, they need to play rock, because according to the rules here, rock beats paper. So they might choose rock next.\n\nIf I expect them to play rock, then I should play scissors, because in this game, scissors beat rock. Wait, no. Wait, according to the rules here: scissors beat rock. So if they play rock, I should play scissors to beat them. But wait, the user's rules are:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors win)\n\nSo the hierarchy is cyclical: paper > scissors > rock > paper. Wait, no, that's not a cycle. Let me clarify:\n\nIf paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, and scissors beat rock, then the cycle is paper > scissors, scissors > rock, rock > paper. So it's a standard cycle but with the order shifted. So each move beats the next in the cycle. So the hierarchy is:\n\nPaper \u2192 beats \u2192 Scissors\n\nScissors \u2192 beats \u2192 Rock\n\nRock \u2192 beats \u2192 Paper\n\nSo the cycle is Paper > Scissors > Rock > Paper.\n\nSo in the previous round, I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won because paper beats scissors. Now, the opponent might think, \"I lost with scissors, so I should play the move that beats what the opponent just used.\" Since I used paper, which is beaten by rock (according to the rules here), they might switch to rock. If they switch to rock, then I should play scissors to beat their rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent, being a new player, might think that since scissors lost to paper, they should try the move that beats paper, which is rock. So they might play rock. Therefore, I should counter with scissors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent will stick with scissors again, thinking that maybe I'll switch. But since they just lost with scissors, they might not. So the most likely move is rock. Therefore, I should play scissors.\n\nWait, but another angle: if the opponent is a new player, they might not be thinking strategically. Maybe they just choose randomly. But given that they just lost with scissors, they might try to counter what beat them. Since paper beat their scissors, they might think to use the move that beats paper, which is rock. So I should play scissors to beat their expected rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper, thinking that since I used paper last time, I might repeat. But in that case, if they play paper, then I should play rock. But that's less likely if they're trying to counter.\n\nHmm. So the key is to predict their next move based on their previous choice. They played scissors and lost. So they might switch to rock to counter my paper. Therefore, I should play scissors. But wait, if they play rock, scissors beats rock, so I win. If they play paper, then scissors would lose (since paper beats scissors here). Wait, no. Wait, according to the rules here, paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beat rock. So if they play paper, and I play scissors, they win. If they play rock, and I play scissors, I win. If they play scissors again, and I play paper again, I win again.\n\nSo possible scenarios:\n\nIf opponent plays rock \u2192 I play scissors \u2192 I win.\n\nIf opponent plays paper \u2192 I play scissors \u2192 they win (since paper beats scissors here).\n\nIf opponent plays scissors again \u2192 I play paper \u2192 I win.\n\nSo the question is, what's the opponent more likely to do after losing with scissors. If they're a new player, they might either:\n\n1. Switch to the move that would have beaten my previous move (rock, since rock beats paper here).\n\n2. Switch randomly.\n\n3. Stick with scissors, thinking I might change.\n\nBut as a new player, they might think that since scissors lost to paper, they need to use the move that beats paper, which is rock. So they might choose rock. Therefore, I should choose scissors.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll expect them to switch to rock, maybe they'll choose paper instead. But that's a higher-level thought, which a new player might not have.\n\nSo the most probable move is rock. Therefore, I should play scissors.\n\nBut wait, another angle: in standard RPS, after a loss, players often switch to the move that would have beaten the opponent's last move. But in this game's rules, the hierarchy is different. So in standard RPS, if I played paper and they played scissors, they would have won. But here, it's reversed. So the opponent might be confused, but according to the game's rules, they lost with scissors against paper. So they might think, \"I need to use the move that beats paper, which is rock.\" So they choose rock. Therefore, I should choose scissors.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the expected move is rock, so I play scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has played scissors and then rock in the last two rounds. First, they chose scissors and lost, then switched to rock and lost again. Now, I need to figure out what they might pick next.\n\nHmm, after two losses, maybe they'll try to change their strategy. If they played rock last time and lost, they might think I expect them to switch again. So, what beats rock? Paper. But if they think I'm going to play paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper. Wait, but scissors would lose to rock. Wait, no, scissors beat paper. So if they think I'll play paper, they might go scissors. But I just played scissors last time and won. Maybe they think I'll stick with scissors again. If they think that, they might play rock again to beat scissors. But they just played rock and lost, so maybe they'll switch to paper this time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern. They went from scissors to rock. Maybe they're rotating through the moves. Scissors -> rock -> paper? If that's the case, next would be paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But wait, they might not follow a pattern. Let's think about common player behaviors. After losing with scissors, they tried rock. Now, if they lost with rock, maybe they'll go back to scissors? Or try paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. I played scissors last time, which beats their rock. If they want to counter scissors, they might play rock again, but that didn't work. Or maybe they'll switch to paper to beat rock. Wait, no. If I played scissors last time, to beat scissors, they need to play rock. But they just did that and lost. So maybe they'll try paper next. If they play paper, then I should play scissors again. But if they expect me to repeat scissors, they might play rock again. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. For example, they played scissors first, which was beaten by my paper. Then they switched to rock, which is beaten by paper. Wait, no, rock beats scissors. Wait, the opponent's first move was scissors, which I beat with paper. Then they played rock, which I beat with scissors. So their next move could be paper, which would beat my previous scissors. If they think I'll play scissors again, they might choose paper. So if I play rock, I can beat their paper. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might play paper. Alternatively, if they're just cycling through moves, scissors -> rock -> paper, then next is paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But I just played scissors last time. Maybe they expect me to switch. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. I played scissors last time. To beat scissors, they need to play rock. But they just played rock and lost, so maybe they'll try something else. If they think I'll play scissors again, they might stick with rock, but that didn't work. Or switch to paper. If they switch to paper, then I should play scissors again. But if they think I'm going to switch, maybe they'll play something else. \n\nThis is a bit of a mind game. Let's try to look for patterns. The opponent's moves so far: scissors (lost), rock (lost). If they're trying to counter my moves, my first move was paper, which beat their scissors. Then I played scissors, which beat their rock. So they might expect me to play rock next, following the cycle. If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they think I'm following a pattern, paper -> scissors -> rock, then my next move would be rock, so they might play paper. Again, scissors would beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're just choosing randomly. But since they're a new player, they might not have a solid strategy yet. After two losses, they might switch to the move that beats their previous choice. They played rock last time, which was beaten by scissors. The move that beats scissors is rock, but they just tried that. Wait, no. To beat scissors, you need rock. They tried rock and lost because I played scissors. Wait, no, scissors beats rock. Wait, no: scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors. So if they played rock and I played scissors, scissors beats rock, so I win. So they played rock, which was beaten by my scissors. So their next move might be paper, which beats rock. But I didn't play rock. I played scissors. So maybe they think I'll play rock next. If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to mirror my previous move. I played scissors last time, so they might play scissors. If they play scissors, I should play rock. But that's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between their previous moves. They played scissors, then rock. Next could be paper. So I should play scissors. \n\nI think the safest bet is to assume they might switch to paper, expecting me to play rock. So I'll play scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, scissors would lose. But they just lost with rock, so maybe they won't play it again. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to scissors. If they do, I should play rock. But I'm not sure. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should use a counter-strategy. Since they lost twice, they might try to change their approach. If they played rock last time and lost, they might switch to paper. So scissors beats paper. So I'll go with scissors again. But if they think I'll repeat scissors, they might play rock again, which would beat me. But they just lost with rock, so maybe they won't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll play paper. So scissors beats paper. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors again, anticipating they switch to paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what move to make next. Let's recap the previous rounds to understand the opponent's pattern.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors. Wait, but the result said I won. Wait, no, paper beats scissors? Wait, no, according to the rules, paper beats scissors gives the winner 1 point. Wait, but in the first round, the user said they played paper, opponent scissors, and they won. But according to the rules, scissors should beat paper. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let me check the initial rules again.\n\nThe user provided the rules as:\n- paper beats scissors (winner gets +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nWait, that's the opposite of the standard game. Normally, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper, rock crushes scissors. But here, the user defined it as paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So in this game, each move beats the one that would normally beat it in the standard game. So paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock. That's a crucial point. So the hierarchy is cyclical but reversed.\n\nSo in the first round, the user played paper, opponent played scissors. Since paper beats scissors here, user wins. Then in the second round, user played scissors, opponent played rock. Since scissors beats rock here, user wins again. Third round, user played scissors, opponent played paper. Since scissors would lose to paper here (because paper beats scissors), so user lost. \n\nSo the opponent's moves so far: scissors (round 1), rock (round 2), paper (round 3). So the pattern seems to be they are cycling through the moves in order: scissors -> rock -> paper. If that's the case, next move would be scissors again. But let's check:\n\nRound 1: opponent scissors\nRound 2: opponent rock\nRound 3: opponent paper\nIf they are cycling in the order of the hierarchy (paper, rock, scissors), but their moves are going scissors, rock, paper. Wait, maybe they are rotating in reverse order. Let me see: the hierarchy is paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So the order is paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock. So the cycle is paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper... etc. But the opponent's moves were scissors, rock, paper. So after scissors comes rock, then paper, then scissors again. So if the pattern continues, next move would be scissors. But let's see:\n\nIf the opponent's moves are scissors (1), rock (2), paper (3), then next would be scissors (4). So if I can predict that, I should choose the move that beats scissors. According to the rules, paper beats scissors. So playing paper would beat scissors. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous moves. Let's see my moves:\n\nRound 1: paper (beat their scissors)\nRound 2: scissors (beat their rock)\nRound 3: scissors (lost to their paper)\nSo my moves were paper, scissors, scissors. The opponent might be reacting to my choices. For example, after I played paper, they might have expected me to repeat, so they played rock (which beats paper), but in round 2, they played rock, which I beat with scissors. Then in round 3, they played paper, which beats scissors. So maybe they are countering my previous move. If I played scissors twice, they might expect me to play scissors again and choose paper. But in round 3, they did that. Now, after I lost with scissors against their paper, they might expect me to switch. If I switch to rock (which beats paper), then they might play scissors to counter rock. But according to the rules here, scissors beats rock. Wait, no: in this game's rules, scissors beats rock. So if I play rock, and they play scissors, they would win. Wait, no: according to the rules, scissors beats rock, so if they play scissors and I play rock, they get +1, I get -1. So if I think they will play scissors next, I should play paper. But how to predict their next move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern of their own. Let's list their moves again:\n\nRound 1: scissors (lost to my paper)\nRound 2: rock (lost to my scissors)\nRound 3: paper (beat my scissors)\nSo their moves are scissors, rock, paper. That's a sequence moving in the order of the hierarchy's beaten moves. Since paper beats scissors, then rock beats paper, then scissors beats rock. So their moves are following the beaten path: scissors (beaten by paper), then rock (beaten by scissors), then paper (beaten by rock). Wait, but in the third round, they played paper, which beats scissors (my move), so they won. So maybe they are cycling through the moves in the order of what beats the previous move. Let me see:\n\nIf they start with scissors, then next move would be what beats scissors, which is paper. But they went to rock. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they are rotating through the moves in reverse order. The standard order is rock, paper, scissors, but here the hierarchy is different. Let me list the possible moves in the order of the hierarchy:\n\nPaper beats scissors\nRock beats paper\nScissors beats rock\n\nSo the order is paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper...\n\nIf the opponent's moves are scissors, rock, paper, that's scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. So after paper, the next would be scissors again. So if they follow that cycle, next is scissors. So to beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors, which they countered with paper. Now, if I switch to rock (which beats paper), they might expect that and play scissors to beat my rock. But in that case, I should play paper to beat their scissors. But this is getting into a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, since they just won by playing paper against my scissors, they might think I'll switch to rock to beat paper. So they might play scissors to beat my rock. If I play paper, I beat their scissors. So maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of their own. Let's see their moves again:\n\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n\nIf this is a cycle, next would be scissors again. So I should play paper. But if they are cycling in the order of the hierarchy, which is paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper..., but their sequence is scissors, rock, paper. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe they are moving in the reverse order. Let's see:\n\nThe hierarchy is paper > scissors > rock > paper. So the order is paper, scissors, rock, paper. If they are going in reverse: rock, scissors, paper, rock... but their moves are scissors, rock, paper. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their previous move. For example:\n\nFirst move: scissors. The move that beats scissors is paper. Next move they played rock. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they are trying to anticipate my moves. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors (I won)\nRound 2: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played paper (they won)\n\nSo in each round, they played the move that would have beaten my previous move. Wait:\n\nAfter I played paper (round 1), they played scissors in round 1. Wait, no, round 1 was my paper vs their scissors. Then in round 2, I played scissors, and they played rock. Rock is what would beat scissors in this game's rules (since rock beats paper, but scissors beats rock here). Wait, no: in this game's rules, scissors beats rock. So if I play scissors, the move that beats me is rock (since scissors beats rock, so rock loses to scissors. Wait, no, according to the rules, scissors beats rock. So if I play scissors, the opponent would need to play paper to beat me, because paper beats scissors. But in round 2, I played scissors, and they played rock, which I beat. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the opponent is not countering my previous move, but following their own pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a rotating strategy. Their moves so far: scissors, rock, paper. If they continue the rotation, next would be scissors. So I should play paper to beat scissors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I played scissors twice in a row and then lost, so they might expect me to switch. If I switch to rock, they might play paper. But in that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. Wait, but in the third round, they played paper and I played scissors, which lost because paper beats scissors here. So if I play scissors again, and they play paper again, I lose. But maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they play scissors. Then I should play paper.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to find a pattern. The opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper. If I list the order of moves in the game's hierarchy:\n\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo the order is Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper...\n\nThe opponent's sequence is Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. That's following the hierarchy's order. So next would be Scissors again. Therefore, if they follow this pattern, their next move is scissors. To beat scissors, I should play paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through all three moves and after paper comes scissors. So their next move is scissors. So I play paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors (which lost to their paper). They might expect me to switch to rock (to beat paper), so they would play scissors (which beats rock). If I play paper, I beat their scissors.\n\nSo possible strategies:\n\n1. Predict they follow the pattern and play scissors next. I play paper.\n2. Predict they counter my previous move (I played scissors, they expect rock, so they play scissors). I play paper.\n3. They might expect me to play paper again, so they play rock. In that case, I should play scissors.\n\nBut given their previous pattern of scissors, rock, paper, the next logical step in the cycle would be scissors. So playing paper would be the safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, since they just won by playing paper, they might stick with paper, expecting me to switch to rock. But if they play paper again, I should play scissors to beat them. Wait, no: in this game's rules, paper beats scissors, so if they play paper and I play scissors, they win. So if they repeat paper, I need to play rock to beat paper. Because rock beats paper here.\n\nWait, let me clarify the rules again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors.\n- Rock beats paper: +1 for rock, -1 for paper.\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock.\n\nSo the hierarchy is:\n\nPaper > Scissors\n\nRock > Paper\n\nScissors > Rock\n\nSo to beat paper, you need rock.\n\nTo beat rock, you need scissors.\n\nTo beat scissors, you need paper.\n\nSo in the last round, they played paper, and I played scissors, which lost. So to beat paper, I should have played rock.\n\nNow, considering that, if the opponent's pattern is scissors, rock, paper, next could be scissors. But if they are cycling through all three, then after paper comes scissors. So I should play paper to beat scissors.\n\nAlternatively, if they think I will switch to rock to beat their paper, they might play scissors to beat my rock. So if I play paper, I beat their scissors.\n\nBut this is a lot of second-guessing. Based on their previous moves, the pattern seems to be scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If that's a cycle, next is scissors. So I play paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are rotating in the opposite direction. Let's see: scissors, rock, paper. If that's the order, then next would be scissors again. So same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play paper.\n",

If that's the case, then after my last move was paper (round 4), they might play scissors again. But in that case, I should play rock to beat scissors. Wait, but in round 4, I played paper and they played scissors, so I won. If they think I'll repeat paper, they might play scissors again, but that would be a loss for them again. Maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my possible scissors. Alternatively, maybe they are cycling through the moves regardless of my actions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern of their own. Let's see their moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors. That's a cycle of S-R-P-S. So next would be R. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat rock. But in the previous cycle, after scissors came rock, then paper, then scissors again. So next would be rock. So paper would be the right move. But I need to check if there's a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe they are rotating through the moves in reverse. Like, after scissors, they go to rock (which is next in the standard order), then paper, then scissors again. So the cycle is S-R-P-S-R-P... So next is R. So paper would beat R. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that when they played scissors, I played paper, so they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors again. But that would be a repeat, and they lost the last time they did that. So maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, thinking I might play scissors again. Wait, in round 4, I played paper, so if they think I'll stick with paper, they might play scissors again, but that would lose again. So maybe they'll switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. To counter paper, they would play scissors. But that's what they did in round 4, and I beat them with paper. So maybe they'll try a different approach. If they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll play rock. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's try to model their possible strategies. If they are cycling S-R-P-S-R-P..., then next is R. So I should play paper. If they are countering my previous move, then since my last move was paper, they might play scissors again, expecting me to repeat paper. But that would be a repeat, and they lost last time. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock to beat their scissors, so they play paper. But that's getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, in round 1, I played paper, so they played scissors (which beats paper). In round 2, I played scissors, so they played rock (beats scissors). In round 3, I played scissors again, so they played paper (beats scissors). In round 4, I played paper, so they played scissors (beats paper). So their strategy is to play the move that beats my previous move. If that's the case, then since my last move was paper, they will play scissors again. But in that case, I should play rock to beat scissors. Wait, but in round 4, I played paper and they played scissors, which I beat. If they follow the same strategy, they'll play scissors again, expecting me to play paper again. But if I play rock, I'll beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to predict my move based on my previous pattern. My moves have been paper, scissors, scissors, paper. So maybe they think I alternate between paper and scissors. So after paper, scissors, scissors, paper, next might be scissors again. If they think I'll play scissors, they'll play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Let's summarize:\n\nOpponent's moves: S, R, P, S\n\nPossible patterns:\n1. Cycling S-R-P-S-R-P... Next is R.\n2. Countering my previous move (they play what beats my last move). My last move was paper, so they play scissors again.\n3. Trying to predict my next move based on my pattern (my moves: P, S, S, P). Maybe I alternate, so next is S. They play R to beat S.\n\nIf I assume pattern 1, next is R. Play paper.\nIf pattern 2, they play S again. Play rock.\nIf pattern 3, they play R. Play paper.\n\nBut which is more likely? Let's look at their history. They lost when they played S and R, won when they played P. Then lost again with S. Maybe they'll try to break the cycle. But their moves so far are S, R, P, S. If they continue the cycle, next is R. So I should play paper. Alternatively, if they notice that I played paper twice (rounds 1 and 4), maybe they expect me to play paper again and choose scissors. But that would be a repeat, and they lost both times. So maybe they switch to rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten their own last move. For example, their last move was S. What beats S? R. So they play R. Then I should play paper. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the safest bet is to assume they are cycling S-R-P-S-R-P..., so next is R. Play paper. Alternatively, if they are countering my previous move (paper), they play scissors again. But I just beat that with paper, so maybe they switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round with scissors, they might switch to rock. If I play paper, I beat rock. If they switch to rock, paper is good. If they stay with scissors, paper still wins. Wait, no. If they play scissors again, and I play paper, I win again. But they just lost with scissors, so maybe they switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are rotating their moves in a different pattern. Let's see: S, R, P, S. The next could be R again, making the pattern S-R-P-S-R-P... So yes, next is R. So play paper. \n\nI think the most consistent pattern here is S-R-P repeating. So after S comes R, then P, then S again. So next is R. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves so far have been scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, let me check the history again.\n\nFirst round: I played paper, they played scissors. I won because paper beats scissors? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first round, the user said they played paper, and the opponent played scissors. But according to the rules, paper beats scissors, so the user should have won. But in the first hint, it says \"You won the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors. You scored 1 points.\" That's correct.\n\nSecond round: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost, but the user message says \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" Wait, that's conflicting. Because scissors lose to rock. So maybe there was a mistake in the user's previous messages. Wait, looking back:\n\nAfter the first move, the user's move was paper, opponent scissors. User won (correct). Then next move, user played scissors, opponent rock. User won? But scissors lose to rock. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their own reporting. Or perhaps the opponent's move was different. Wait, let me check the exact user messages:\n\nIn the second round, the user's move was scissors, opponent rock. The user message says \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" That's impossible. Unless there's a mistake in the game rules. Wait, according to the initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (user gets +1)\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nSo scissors beats rock. So if user plays scissors and opponent plays rock, user should win. Wait, the initial rules said:\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo scissors beats rock. So if user plays scissors and opponent plays rock, user wins. So in the second round, user played scissors, opponent rock: user wins. That's correct.\n\nThird round: user played scissors again, opponent paper. User lost. Because scissors lose to paper. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if user plays scissors and opponent plays paper, opponent's paper beats user's scissors. So user loses, gets -1. Correct.\n\nFourth round: user played paper, opponent scissors. User wins again. Then next round, user played paper again, opponent rock. User loses because rock beats paper.\n\nSo the opponent's moves so far have been: scissors (round 1), rock (round 2), paper (round 3), scissors (round 4), rock (round 5). So the pattern seems to be scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. So maybe the opponent is cycling through scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper...?\n\nWait, let's list the opponent's moves:\n\nRound 1: scissors\n\nRound 2: rock\n\nRound 3: paper\n\nRound 4: scissors\n\nRound 5: rock\n\nSo the opponent's pattern is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. It looks like they are cycling through the three moves in order: scissors, rock, paper, then repeats. So after rock comes paper again. So in round 6, the opponent would play paper again, following the cycle.\n\nBut wait, after round 3, opponent played paper. Then round 4, they went back to scissors. So maybe the cycle is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc. So the sequence is repeating every three moves. So after paper, it loops back to scissors.\n\nSo if the opponent's next move is paper (since the last move was rock in round 5), then the next move would be paper. But according to the cycle, after rock comes paper. So in round 6, opponent would play paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But wait, the user's last move was paper, which lost to rock. So the user might think the opponent is following a pattern. Let me see the user's previous moves and the opponent's responses:\n\nRound 1: User paper vs Opponent scissors (user wins)\n\nRound 2: User scissors vs Opponent rock (user wins)\n\nRound 3: User scissors vs Opponent paper (user loses)\n\nRound 4: User paper vs Opponent scissors (user wins)\n\nRound 5: User paper vs Opponent rock (user loses)\n\nSo the opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. So the pattern is scissors, rock, paper, then repeats. So after rock comes paper again. So next move (round 6) opponent would play paper. Therefore, user should play scissors to beat paper. But wait, in round 3, user played scissors and opponent played paper, which made user lose. So if opponent is cycling, then in round 6, opponent plays paper. So user should play scissors to beat paper. But in round 3, user did that and lost. Wait, no: in round 3, user played scissors, opponent played paper. Paper beats scissors, so user loses. So if opponent plays paper again, user should play scissors to lose, but that's not helpful. Wait, no: if opponent plays paper, user should play scissors to lose, but that's not good. Wait, no: paper beats scissors, so if opponent plays paper, user needs to play scissors to lose, but that's bad. Wait, no, the user wants to win. So if opponent plays paper, user should play scissors to lose, which is bad. Wait, no: paper beats scissors, so if opponent plays paper, user should play scissors to lose. So to win against paper, user needs to play rock. Because rock beats paper. So if opponent is going to play paper next, user should play rock.\n\nWait, let me recheck the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins, scissors loses)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins, paper loses)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors wins, rock loses)\n\nSo to beat paper, you need rock. So if opponent plays paper, user should play rock to win.\n\nBut according to the opponent's pattern, after rock comes paper. So in round 6, opponent plays paper. So user should play rock.\n\nBut the user's previous move in round 5 was paper, which lost to opponent's rock. So the user might think that the opponent is following a cycle of scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper. So next move is paper. Therefore, user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to the user's moves. Let's see:\n\nUser's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper.\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.\n\nLooking for a pattern in opponent's moves relative to user's moves:\n\nRound 1: User paper, Opponent scissors (scissors loses to paper)\n\nRound 2: User scissors, Opponent rock (rock beats scissors)\n\nRound 3: User scissors, Opponent paper (paper beats scissors)\n\nRound 4: User paper, Opponent scissors (scissors loses to paper)\n\nRound 5: User paper, Opponent rock (rock beats paper)\n\nSo the opponent seems to be countering the user's previous move. For example:\n\nAfter user played paper (round 1), opponent in round 2 played rock (which loses to paper, but in round 2, opponent played rock when user played scissors. Wait, maybe not. Let me see:\n\nWait, in round 1, user played paper, opponent played scissors (which loses to paper). Then in round 2, user played scissors, opponent played rock (which beats scissors). Then in round 3, user played scissors again, opponent played paper (which beats scissors). Then in round 4, user played paper, opponent played scissors (loses to paper). Then in round 5, user played paper again, opponent played rock (beats paper). So the opponent is playing the move that beats the user's previous move. For example:\n\nUser's previous move: paper (round 1) \u2192 opponent next move: scissors (which loses to paper, but that's not the case. Wait, in round 1, opponent played scissors, which loses to user's paper. Then in round 2, user played scissors, opponent played rock (which beats scissors). Then in round 3, user played scissors again, opponent played paper (beats scissors). Round 4: user played paper, opponent scissors (loses). Round 5: user played paper again, opponent rock (beats paper). So the opponent is playing the move that beats the user's previous move. For example:\n\nAfter user plays paper (round 1), opponent in round 2 plays rock (which beats scissors, but user's next move was scissors. Wait, maybe the opponent is predicting the user's next move based on previous patterns. Alternatively, the opponent is countering the user's last move. Let's see:\n\nIf the opponent is trying to beat the user's last move:\n\nRound 1: user plays paper. Opponent plays scissors (loses). So that doesn't fit.\n\nRound 2: user plays scissors. Opponent plays rock (beats scissors). So yes.\n\nRound 3: user plays scissors again. Opponent plays paper (beats scissors). Yes.\n\nRound 4: user plays paper. Opponent plays scissors (beats paper). Wait, scissors beats paper? No, paper beats scissors. So opponent plays scissors to beat paper? That's incorrect. Wait, in round 4, user played paper, opponent played scissors. But scissors loses to paper. So that doesn't fit the pattern of opponent trying to beat user's last move. So maybe the opponent is cycling through their own moves regardless of the user's moves.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent's moves are scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper... So every three moves, they cycle. So after rock comes paper. So next move is paper. Therefore, user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent noticed that when they played rock, they beat the user's paper (in round 5). So maybe they'll stick with rock. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is following a pattern of their own previous moves. Let's see their moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. So the sequence is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. It's like they are incrementing through the moves: scissors (1), rock (2), paper (3), then back to scissors (4), rock (5), paper (6). So next would be paper. So user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is following a cycle of their own moves, and after rock comes paper. So user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nBut in the last round, user played paper, opponent played rock. So user lost. Now, if opponent is following a cycle, next move is paper. So user should play rock. But if the opponent is instead reacting to the user's previous move (which was paper), they might play rock again to beat paper. But in round 5, opponent played rock to beat user's paper. If user now plays paper again, opponent might play rock again. But user just lost with paper, so maybe they switch. Alternatively, the opponent might expect the user to switch to scissors to beat rock, so opponent plays paper to beat scissors. But this is getting into higher-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a rotating strategy: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. So next is paper. So user plays rock.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a pattern based on the user's previous moves. The user's last move was paper (round 5), which lost to opponent's rock. So maybe the opponent thinks the user will switch from paper to something else. If the user switches to scissors to beat rock, then opponent might play rock again to beat scissors. But that's speculative.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern in the opponent's moves:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.\n\nLooking at the order, it's scissors (1), rock (2), paper (3), scissors (4), rock (5). So the pattern seems to be repeating every three moves: scissors, rock, paper, then scissors again, rock again, paper again. So the next move (round 6) would be paper. Therefore, user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is cycling through the moves in order, so after rock comes paper. So rock (round 5) \u2192 paper (round 6). So user plays rock to beat paper.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\nRound 1: scissors\n\nRound 2: rock\n\nRound 3: paper\n\nRound 4: scissors\n\nRound 5: rock\n\nRound 6: paper\n\nYes, that's a cycle of three, repeating. So next move is paper. Therefore, user should play rock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a different pattern. For example, after two rocks, but that doesn't fit. Or alternating between scissors and rock, but in the sequence, it's scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. So not a simple alternation.\n\nAnother approach: the opponent's moves are following the sequence of what would beat the user's previous move. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: user plays paper. Opponent plays scissors (which loses to paper). So that doesn't fit.\n\nRound 2: user plays scissors. Opponent plays rock (beats scissors). Yes.\n\nRound 3: user plays scissors. Opponent plays paper (beats scissors). Yes.\n\nRound 4: user plays paper. Opponent plays scissors (loses to paper). So no.\n\nRound 5: user plays paper. Opponent plays rock (beats paper). Yes.\n\nSo in rounds 2,3,5, opponent played the move that beats the user's previous move. But in rounds 1 and 4, they didn't. So maybe the opponent is sometimes countering the user's last move, but not always. Maybe they are learning or adjusting.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is countering the user's most frequent move. The user has played paper three times (rounds 1,4,5), scissors twice (2,3). So opponent might expect paper again and play rock. But user just played paper and lost to rock, so maybe user will switch. If opponent expects user to switch to scissors to beat rock, then opponent would play rock again to beat scissors. But this is getting into mind games.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what the user played previously. But user's previous move was paper (round 5), so opponent would play paper. But that doesn't fit, as opponent's next move would be paper, which user can beat with rock.\n\nThis is tricky. Given the opponent's history of scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, the most consistent pattern is a cycle of scissors, rock, paper repeating. So next move is paper. Therefore, user should play rock to beat paper.\n\nBut let's also consider that in the last round, user played paper and lost to rock. If the opponent expects the user to switch from paper to something else (like scissors to beat rock), then opponent might play rock again to beat scissors. But if user plays rock, then it's a tie. Or if user plays paper again, opponent might play rock again.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is alternating between rock and scissors. But their moves are scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Not a clear alternation.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent's moves have beaten the user's move in rounds 2,3,5, but not in 1 and 4. So in rounds where the user played scissors (2,3), opponent countered with rock and paper. When user played paper (1,4,5), opponent sometimes played scissors (losing) and sometimes rock (winning). So maybe the opponent is adjusting to counter the user's tendency to play paper. Since user has played paper three times, opponent might expect paper again and play rock. So user should play paper to counter rock? Wait, no. If opponent plays rock, user should play paper to lose, but that's bad. Wait, rock beats paper. So if opponent plays rock, user should play paper to lose. Wait, no: rock beats paper, so if opponent plays rock, user should play paper and lose. So to counter rock, user should play scissors.\n\nBut if the opponent is expecting paper and plays rock, user can play scissors to beat rock. But this requires predicting the opponent's move.\n\nAlternatively, the user can try to break the pattern. Since the opponent has played rock twice (rounds 2 and 5), maybe they'll play rock again. So user should play paper to lose, but that's not good. Or play scissors to beat rock.\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the opponent's history, the most logical next move in their cycle is paper. So user plays rock.\n",

Then I played paper again, they played scissors again, I won. Then I played paper again, they played rock, I lost. Then I played rock, they played paper, I won.

When I played paper, they played scissors. Then I played scissors, they played rock. Then scissors again, they played paper. Then paper, they played scissors. Then paper again, they played rock. Then rock, they played paper. So their moves are following a pattern of countering my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). Then I played scissors again, they played paper (loses to scissors, which is odd). Wait, that doesn't fit.

But according to their cycle, after paper comes scissors. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own, not related to my moves. If their cycle is scissors, rock, paper, repeating, then next is scissors. So rock would beat that. But if they break the cycle, maybe they'll adjust. Alternatively, maybe they noticed that I'm trying to predict their cycle and will change. But given that they've followed the cycle so far, it's safer to assume they'll continue.

Wait, maybe the user's messages have errors. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me check the initial rules again.\n\nThe user's initial message says:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1.\n- rock beats paper: winner +1, loser -1.\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1.\n- Same move: tie, 0 points.\n\nSo in round 2, I played scissors, opponent played rock. Since rock beats scissors, opponent should get +1, I get -1. But the user's message says \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" That's impossible. There's a mistake here. Similarly, in round 5: I played paper, opponent rock. Paper beats rock, so I should get +1, but the user says I scored -1. This suggests that the user's messages might have errors, or perhaps the opponent's move was different. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's messages have a typo. For example, in round 2, maybe the opponent's move was scissors, not rock. But according to the user's message, opponent played rock. So there's inconsistency. This could be a test scenario where the opponent's moves are following a certain pattern, but the scoring is being reported incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the user is making a mistake in the game simulation.\n\nAssuming that the user's messages are accurate, despite the apparent contradictions, I need to proceed. Let's take the given history as is, even if the scoring seems off. So the opponent's moves are as reported:\n\n1. scissors (I won)\n2. rock (I won)\n3. paper (I lost)\n4. scissors (I won)\n5. rock (I lost)\n6. paper (I won)\n7. scissors (I lost)\n\nSo the opponent's sequence is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. The pattern is repeating every three moves: scissors, rock, paper, then repeat. So after scissors (7th), the next would be rock (8th). Therefore, if I play paper, I can beat rock. But in round 5, when I played paper against their rock, the user said I lost. That's conflicting. Unless there's a different rule. Wait, maybe the user has the rules reversed. Let me check again.\n\nUser's initial rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1.\n- rock beats paper: winner +1, loser -1.\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1.\n\nSo paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock. So in round 5, if I play paper and opponent plays rock, I should win. But user says I lost. That's a contradiction. Unless the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the opponent's move was actually scissors. But according to the user's message, opponent played rock. So this is confusing. Maybe the user's test scenario is set up with errors to test my ability to adapt despite inconsistencies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is not following a strict cycle but adjusting based on my moves. For example, after losing with scissors, they switched to rock, then after losing with rock, they switched to paper, etc. But given the history, it's hard to see a clear pattern. Alternatively, the opponent is cycling through the moves in order, regardless of outcomes.\n\nGiven the opponent's sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. The next move should be rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. But in round 5, when I played paper against their rock, the user said I lost. That's impossible unless the rules are different. But according to the initial rules, paper beats rock. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is countering my previous move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors next. But looking at the history:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock.\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.\n\nSo after I played paper (round 1), they played scissors (round 1). Then I played scissors (round 2), they played rock. Then I played scissors (round 3), they played paper. Then I played paper (round 4), they played scissors. Then I played paper (round 5), they played rock. Then I played rock (round 6), they played paper. Then I played rock (round 7), they played scissors.\n\nSo perhaps the opponent is choosing the move that would beat my previous move. For example:\n\nIn round 1: I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper).\n\nRound 2: I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors).\n\nRound 3: I played scissors again, they played paper (beats scissors? No, paper is beaten by scissors. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in round 3, I played scissors, they played paper. According to the rules, scissors beats paper, so I should have won, but the user said I lost. That's conflicting again. So this suggests that the opponent is not following a pattern based on my previous move, but perhaps cycling through their own moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a different strategy, like always playing the move that would beat their own last move. For example, if they played scissors, next play rock (since rock beats scissors), then paper (beats rock), then scissors (beats paper), etc. But their sequence is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. That fits a cycle of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. So each move is the one that beats their previous move. For example, after scissors, they play rock (beats scissors), then paper (beats rock), then scissors (beats paper), and repeat.\n\nIf that's the case, then their next move after scissors would be rock. So to counter rock, I should play paper. But in round 5, when they played rock and I played paper, the user said I lost. That's conflicting. Unless the user's reporting is wrong. But assuming the user's messages are correct, despite the contradictions, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a different pattern. Let's see their moves again: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. The cycle is scissors, rock, paper, repeating. So the next move should be rock. Therefore, I should play paper. But according to the user's history, when I played paper against their rock (round 5), I lost. That's impossible unless the rules are reversed. But according to the initial rules, paper beats rock. So this is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in that round. Alternatively, perhaps the opponent's move in round 5 was actually scissors, not rock. But according to the user, it was rock. So I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is choosing the move that I last played. For example, in round 1, I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Round 2, I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). Round 3, I played scissors again, they played paper (beats scissors). Round 4, I played paper, they played scissors. Round 5, I played paper again, they played rock. Round 6, I played rock, they played paper. Round 7, I played rock again, they played scissors. So yes, it seems like the opponent is always playing the move that beats my previous move. So whatever I played last, they play the move that beats it. For example:\n\nMy last move was rock (round 7), so they play paper to beat rock. Wait, but in round 7, they played scissors. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, in round 7, I played rock, and they played scissors. Scissors lose to rock, so that doesn't fit the pattern. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is cycling through their moves regardless of my actions. Their sequence is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. So the next move is rock. So I should play paper. But given that in round 5, when they played rock and I played paper, the user said I lost, which is impossible. So perhaps the user's messages have errors, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my previous move in a different way. For example, if I play the same move twice, they counter it. But looking at the history:\n\nRound 1: paper \u2192 opponent scissors\nRound 2: scissors \u2192 opponent rock\nRound 3: scissors \u2192 opponent paper\nRound 4: paper \u2192 opponent scissors\nRound 5: paper \u2192 opponent rock\nRound 6: rock \u2192 opponent paper\nRound 7: rock \u2192 opponent scissors\n\nSo when I repeated scissors (rounds 2 and 3), they went from rock to paper. When I repeated paper (rounds 4 and 5), they went from scissors to rock. When I repeated rock (rounds 6 and 7), they went from paper to scissors. So it seems like when I repeat a move, they play the move that beats the move that beat my previous move. For example, if I play paper twice, they first play scissors (beats paper), then rock (beats scissors). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played rock last, they play paper. But in round 7, I played rock, and they played scissors, which doesn't fit. So this is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the confusion in the scoring, perhaps the best approach is to look for the opponent's pattern in their move sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors. The next move should be rock. So I should play paper. Despite the previous inconsistency in round 5, maybe that was a mistake, and the opponent's next move is rock. Therefore, I'll play paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against another player, and they need to figure out the best move each round. The history so far shows that the opponent has been following a pattern: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc. But in the last few rounds, the opponent's moves have been a bit inconsistent.\n\nIn the previous rounds, when the user played paper, the opponent played scissors (user won). Then scissors vs. rock (user won), scissors vs. paper (user lost), paper vs. scissors (user won), paper vs. rock (user lost), rock vs. paper (user won), rock vs. scissors (user lost), paper vs. rock (user lost again). \n\nThe user's strategy has been trying to predict the opponent's next move based on a cycle. However, the opponent might be catching on or changing their pattern. The last few moves by the opponent were rock, scissors, rock. Wait, after the user played paper, the opponent played rock, which beat paper. Then the user played rock, expecting paper, but the opponent played scissors. Then the user played paper again, expecting rock, but the opponent played rock again. So the opponent might be sticking to rock more often now, especially after winning with it.\n\nSo maybe the opponent is favoring rock, especially after winning with it. The user's last move was paper, expecting rock, but the opponent played rock again. So the user lost. Now, the user needs to decide the next move. If the opponent is sticking with rock, then the user should play paper to beat it. But if the opponent thinks the user will switch to paper again, they might play scissors. Alternatively, if the opponent is alternating, maybe they'll go back to paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to counter the user's previous moves. The user has been using paper, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper. The opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. Wait, let me check again:\n\nRound 1: User paper vs. Opponent scissors (user won)\nRound 2: User scissors vs. Opponent rock (user won)\nRound 3: User scissors vs. Opponent paper (user lost)\nRound 4: User paper vs. Opponent scissors (user won)\nRound 5: User paper vs. Opponent rock (user lost)\nRound 6: User rock vs. Opponent paper (user won)\nRound 7: User rock vs. Opponent scissors (user lost)\nRound 8: User paper vs. Opponent rock (user lost)\n\nSo opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. The last three moves were rock, scissors, rock. Wait, no, let's list them properly:\n\nOpponent's moves in order:\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. scissors\n7. rock\n8. rock\n\nLooking at the opponent's recent moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock. The last two were rock. So maybe the opponent is sticking to rock now. If that's the case, the user should play paper. But the user just played paper and lost because the opponent played rock. Wait, no: in the last round, the user played paper, opponent played rock, so user lost. So opponent's last move was rock. If the opponent is repeating rock, then the user should play paper again. But that's what the user did last time and lost. Alternatively, maybe the opponent expects the user to switch to scissors to beat paper, so the opponent might play rock again. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a pattern of rock twice, then something else. Or perhaps they're reacting to the user's moves. The user's last move was paper, which loses to rock. If the opponent thinks the user will switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat rock. But the user's next move could be scissors to beat paper. But this is getting into second-level thinking.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has played rock three times in the last four moves (moves 5,7,8), maybe they're favoring rock. So the best move would be paper. But since the user just tried that and lost, maybe the opponent is expecting that and will switch. Alternatively, the opponent might continue with rock. It's a bit of a gamble. Alternatively, the user could switch to scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper. But if the opponent is sticking with rock, scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. For example, if the user played paper last time and lost, they might expect the user to switch to scissors (to beat paper), so the opponent would play rock. But the user could then play paper again to beat rock. But this is getting into a cycle. \n\nGiven the opponent's recent moves, especially the last two being rock, it's possible they're sticking with rock. So playing paper again might be the way to go, even though it just failed. Alternatively, the opponent might switch to paper, expecting the user to play rock. But the user's last move was paper, so maybe the opponent expects a switch to scissors. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume the opponent is sticking with rock, so play paper. But since that just failed, perhaps the opponent will switch. Alternatively, the user could vary their strategy. Maybe play rock, expecting the opponent to play scissors. But the opponent's last move was rock, so if they follow a pattern, they might play paper next. \n\nWait, looking at the opponent's move history: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. There's no clear cycle, but the last three moves are rock, scissors, rock, rock. It's possible they're trying to counter the user's previous moves. For example, when the user played paper, they played rock. Then when the user played rock, they played scissors. Then when the user played paper again, they played rock again. So maybe the opponent is countering the user's last move. Let's see:\n\nUser's move -> Opponent's move:\npaper (user) -> scissors (opponent) \u2192 user won\nscissors (user) -> rock (opponent) \u2192 user won\nscissors (user) -> paper (opponent) \u2192 user lost\npaper (user) -> scissors (opponent) \u2192 user won\npaper (user) -> rock (opponent) \u2192 user lost\nrock (user) -> paper (opponent) \u2192 user won\nrock (user) -> scissors (opponent) \u2192 user lost\npaper (user) -> rock (opponent) \u2192 user lost\n\nSo the opponent's move seems to sometimes counter the user's previous move. For example, when the user played scissors, opponent played rock. When user played paper, opponent played scissors or rock. When user played rock, opponent played paper or scissors. It's inconsistent. Maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to predict the user's next move based on the user's pattern. The user has been alternating between paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc., but not in a clear cycle. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play rock, expecting the opponent to play scissors again. But the opponent's last move was rock, so if they continue with rock, paper would win. Alternatively, if the opponent thinks the user will switch to scissors, they might play rock again. \n\nAlternatively, the user could try to break the pattern by playing scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper. But given the opponent's recent moves, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven that the opponent has played rock three times in the last four rounds, maybe they're sticking with it. So the user should play paper. Even though it just failed, maybe the opponent will continue. Alternatively, the opponent might switch. \n\nAlternatively, the user could play scissors, hoping the opponent plays paper. But if the opponent is sticking with rock, that's a loss. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Based on the opponent's recent tendency to play rock, the best bet might be to play paper again. But since that just lost, maybe the opponent expects that and will switch. Alternatively, the user could switch to scissors, hoping the opponent plays paper. \n\nAlternatively, the user could play rock, expecting the opponent to play scissors again. But the opponent's last two moves were rock, so maybe they're not. \n\nHmm. Maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten the user's last move. For example, if the user last played paper, the opponent plays scissors (which beats paper). But in the last round, the user played paper, and the opponent played rock. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they play the move that the user played two moves ago. Let's check:\n\nUser's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper.\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock.\n\nLooking for a pattern where opponent plays user's move from two rounds prior. For example:\n\nRound 3: opponent plays paper. User's move two rounds before (round 1) was paper. So opponent plays paper. That matches.\n\nRound 4: opponent plays scissors. User's move two rounds before (round 2) was scissors. So opponent plays scissors. That matches.\n\nRound 5: opponent plays rock. User's move two rounds before (round 3) was scissors. Opponent plays rock. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent could be mirroring the user's previous move. For example, user plays paper, opponent plays paper. But in the first round, user played paper, opponent played scissors. Doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to assume the opponent is sticking with rock, so play paper. Even though it failed last time, sometimes patterns repeat. Alternatively, switch to scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper. \n\nAlternatively, use a counter-strategy: if the opponent has been playing rock a lot, play paper. But if they switch to paper, then scissors would be better. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to play scissors, expecting the opponent to switch to paper after their recent rock plays. But this is a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the user could try to detect a pattern in the opponent's moves. The opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock. Let's list them:\n\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. scissors\n7. rock\n8. rock\n\nLooking at the last three moves: rock, scissors, rock, rock. The last two are rock. Maybe the opponent is settling on rock. So play paper. But the user just did that and lost. Maybe the opponent will continue with rock. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might think, \"I played rock twice, the user will expect rock again and play paper, so I'll play scissors.\" But that's third-level thinking. \n\nAlternatively, the user could play rock, expecting the opponent to play scissors again. But the opponent's last move was rock, so if they continue, rock would tie. \n\nThis is tricky. Given the opponent's recent moves, the most recent being rock, and the user's last move being paper (which lost to rock), maybe the opponent will expect the user to switch to scissors to beat paper, so the opponent plays rock again. Therefore, the user should play paper again. \n\nAlternatively, the user could vary their strategy and play rock, hoping the opponent plays scissors. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's a gamble. Based on the opponent's recent moves, I'll go with paper again, hoping they continue with rock.\n",

So their cycle might be scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors, but after a tie, they might repeat the same move. Or maybe they're reacting to my moves. Let me see the pattern of their moves in response to mine:\n\nWhen I play paper, they play scissors or rock.\nWhen I play scissors, they play rock or paper.\nWhen I play rock, they play paper or scissors.\n\nIt's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they're using a simple rotation. For example, after losing with scissors, they switch to rock; after losing with rock, switch to paper; after losing with paper, switch to scissors. But when they win, they might stick to the same move. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: They played scissors (I played paper) \u2013 they lost, next move rock.\nRound 2: They played rock (I played scissors) \u2013 they lost, next move paper.\nRound 3: They played paper (I played scissors) \u2013 they won, next move scissors.\nRound 4: They played scissors (I played paper) \u2013 they lost, next move rock.\nRound 5: They played rock (I played paper) \u2013 they won, next move paper.\nRound 6: They played paper (I played rock) \u2013 they lost, next move scissors.\nRound 7: They played scissors (I played rock) \u2013 they lost, next move rock.\nRound 8: They played rock (I played paper) \u2013 they won, next move paper.\nRound 9: They played paper (I played rock) \u2013 they lost, next move scissors.\nRound 10: They played scissors (I played rock) \u2013 they lost, next move rock.\nRound 11: They played rock (I played paper) \u2013 tie, next move scissors.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the opponent is cycling through the moves in a fixed order regardless of outcome. Let's see their sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, that's a cycle of scissors -> rock -> paper repeating. So every three rounds, they cycle through. But after the tie in round 10 (both paper), they went back to scissors. Maybe they reset the cycle after a tie. Alternatively, they might be using a different strategy, like trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors next; if I played scissors, they play rock; if I played rock, they play paper. Let's check:\n\nMy previous move before their current move:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, they played scissors (counter to paper is scissors)\nRound 2: I played scissors, they played rock (counter to scissors is rock)\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played paper (counter to scissors is rock, but they played paper. Doesn't fit.)\nRound 4: I played paper, they played scissors (counter)\nRound 5: I played paper, they played rock (counter to paper is scissors, but they played rock. Doesn't fit.)\nRound 6: I played rock, they played paper (counter)\nRound 7: I played rock, they played scissors (counter to rock is paper, but they played scissors. Doesn't fit.)\nRound 8: I played paper, they played rock (counter to paper is scissors, but they played rock. Doesn't fit.)\nRound 9: I played rock, they played paper (counter)\nRound 10: I played paper, they played scissors (counter)\nRound 11: I played rock, they played scissors (counter to rock is paper, but they played scissors. Doesn't fit.)\n\nSo sometimes they counter, sometimes not. Maybe they're alternating between countering and following a cycle. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous patterns. For example, if I tend to repeat a move after a loss, they might counter that. Let's see my moves:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, rock, rock.\n\nHmm, I've been switching between paper, scissors, and rock, but sometimes repeating. The opponent might be trying to predict my next move based on my previous ones. For example, if I played rock twice, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. But in the last round, I played rock, they played scissors, which loses to rock. So that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not following a strict pattern, but making random moves. However, given that they're a new player, they might be using a simple strategy like always playing the move that beats the last move that beat them. For example, if they lost with scissors to my paper, they might play rock next (since rock beats scissors). But in round 2, they played rock after losing with scissors, which makes sense. Then in round 3, after losing with rock, they played paper. Then after losing with paper, they played scissors again. That seems like a cycle. So their strategy might be to cycle through the moves in order, regardless of outcome. So scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors, etc. If that's the case, then after their last move was scissors (round 11), the next move should be rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. But let's check their sequence again:\n\nTheir moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, [next?]\n\nIf they're cycling scissors -> rock -> paper, then after rock (round 11), next would be paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. Wait, but in round 10, they played scissors, then in round 11, they played rock. So the cycle is scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors... So after rock comes paper. So next move should be paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. But in the last round, they played scissors (round 11), then according to the cycle, next would be rock, then paper. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list their moves again:\n\n1. scissors\n2. rock\n3. paper\n4. scissors\n5. rock\n6. paper\n7. scissors\n8. rock\n9. paper\n10. scissors\n11. rock\n\nSo the pattern is scissors, rock, paper repeating. So every three moves, it's scissors, rock, paper. So after rock (11th move), the next should be paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. But in the last round (11), they played rock, so next would be paper. So I should play scissors. Alternatively, if they're following a different pattern, maybe after a tie, they switch. But the tie was in round 10, where both played paper. Then they played scissors in round 11. Wait, no, in round 10, I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then in round 11, I played rock, they played scissors. So after the tie, they switched to scissors. Maybe they're not following a strict cycle. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous move. For example, if I played rock last time, they play scissors to beat my rock. But in round 11, I played rock, they played scissors, which loses to rock. That doesn't make sense. Maybe they thought I would play scissors next, so they played scissors to tie, but I played rock. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Since they seem to cycle scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc., then the next move after rock (round 11) would be paper. So I should play scissors. Alternatively, if they're reacting to my moves, and I played rock last time, they might expect me to play rock again and counter with paper. But in that case, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might play scissors to beat paper. But that's getting into second-level thinking. Given that they're a new player, they might not be that sophisticated. Maybe they're just cycling through the moves. So next move is paper. Therefore, I should play scissors.\n",

It seems like they might be cycling through the moves in a specific order: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. \n\nBut wait, in the last few rounds, after I played scissors and they played rock, then I played rock expecting their paper, but they played scissors instead. Then when I switched to paper, they played rock again. Hmm, maybe they're not strictly following a cycle but reacting to my previous moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. Then when I played scissors, they played rock. Then when I played rock, they played paper. It looks like they're countering my last move each time. If that's the case, they might be using a strategy where they play the move that beats my previous move. \n\nLet me check the sequence again:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (they countered my paper with scissors).\n2. I played scissors, they played rock (countered my scissors with rock).\n3. I played scissors again, they played paper (countered my scissors with paper? Wait, no, scissors lose to rock, not paper. Wait, in that round, I played scissors and they played paper, which I lost. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not consistently countering. \n\nWait, let's list all the moves:\n\nRound 1: Me: paper, Opponent: scissors (I won)\nRound 2: Me: scissors, Opponent: rock (I won)\nRound 3: Me: scissors, Opponent: paper (I lost)\nRound 4: Me: paper, Opponent: scissors (I won)\nRound 5: Me: paper, Opponent: rock (I lost)\nRound 6: Me: rock, Opponent: paper (I won)\nRound 7: Me: rock, Opponent: scissors (I lost)\nRound 8: Me: paper, Opponent: rock (I lost)\nRound 9: Me: paper, Opponent: paper (tie)\nRound 10: Me: rock, Opponent: scissors (I lost)\nRound 11: Me: scissors, Opponent: rock (I won)\nRound 12: Me: scissors, Opponent: rock (I won again?)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list them properly based on the hints provided:\n\nLooking back at the user's hints:\n\n1. First round: Opponent played scissors (I played paper, won)\n2. Second round: Opponent played rock (I played scissors, won)\n3. Third round: Opponent played paper (I played scissors, lost)\n4. Fourth round: Opponent played scissors (I played paper, won)\n5. Fifth round: Opponent played rock (I played paper, lost)\n6. Sixth round: Opponent played paper (I played rock, won)\n7. Seventh round: Opponent played scissors (I played rock, lost)\n8. Eighth round: Opponent played rock (I played paper, lost)\n9. Ninth round: Opponent played paper (I played paper, tie)\n10. Tenth round: Opponent played scissors (I played rock, lost)\n11. Eleventh round: Opponent played rock (I played scissors, won)\n12. Twelfth round: Opponent played scissors (I played scissors, but the last hint says I played scissors and they played rock, so I lost. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is cycling through their moves in a pattern. Let's see their moves in order:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors...\n\nWait, that doesn't form a clear cycle. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. For example, if I tend to repeat a move after winning, they might counter that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a simple rotation. For example, after playing scissors, they go to rock, then paper, then scissors again. But looking at their moves:\n\nscissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors...\n\nHmm, the last few moves after the tie were: opponent played paper (tie), then scissors, then rock, then scissors. That doesn't fit a strict cycle. Maybe they're alternating between moves. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I last played scissors, they might play rock next, thinking I'll repeat. But in the last round, I played scissors and they played rock, which I won by playing scissors again. Wait, no, in the last round, I played scissors and they played rock, so I lost. Wait, the user's hint says: \"You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\" So in that case, they played rock against my scissors, which beats scissors, so I lost. \n\nBut then in the next round, I played scissors again, and they played rock again? Wait, no, the last round mentioned was when I played scissors and they played rock, I lost. Then the next round, I played scissors again, and they played rock again, but that's not possible because the user's hints show that after that, I played scissors and they played rock again. Wait, maybe the opponent is sticking to a pattern of playing rock more often. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"beat the previous move\" strategy. For example, whatever I played last, they play the move that beats it. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nIf I played paper, they play scissors (beats paper)\nIf I played scissors, they play rock (beats scissors)\nIf I played rock, they play paper (beats rock)\n\nLooking at the history:\n\nRound 1: I played paper \u2192 they played scissors (beats paper) \u2714\ufe0f\nRound 2: I played scissors \u2192 they played rock (beats scissors) \u2714\ufe0f\nRound 3: I played scissors \u2192 they played paper (doesn't beat scissors; scissors beats paper. So this contradicts the hypothesis)\nWait, in round 3, I played scissors, they played paper. That would mean they played a move that loses to my previous move. So that breaks the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"lose to the previous move\" strategy, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're cycling through their own moves regardless of mine. Let's see their moves:\n\nscissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors...\n\nIt seems like they're cycling scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper... but the last few moves after the tie were paper, scissors, rock, scissors. Wait, after the tie (both played paper), the next move they played scissors, then rock, then scissors. That breaks the cycle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my previous move in a different way. For example, if I won the last round, they switch to beat my last move. If they lost, they stick with the same move. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach. Since the opponent is a new player, maybe they're using a simple strategy like always playing the move that beats the last move they played. For example, if they played rock last time, they play paper next. Or they could be trying to counter my patterns. \n\nAlternatively, given that they've played scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc., maybe they're following a fixed cycle. If that's the case, their next move after scissors would be rock again. But in the last round, they played scissors, so next would be rock. \n\nWait, in the last round, I played scissors and they played rock (I lost). Then the next round, if they follow the cycle, they would play paper. But if I play paper, I would lose to their scissors. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIf their cycle is scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper..., then after scissors comes rock, then paper, then scissors. \n\nBut in the last few rounds, their moves were: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors. Wait, the last move was scissors. So next would be rock. \n\nIf that's the case, then their next move would be rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the previous round, when I played scissors, they played rock. If their cycle is continuing, next they would play paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to track their moves in order based on the hints provided:\n\n1. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, won)\n2. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, won)\n3. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, lost)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, won)\n5. Opponent: rock (I played paper, lost)\n6. Opponent: paper (I played rock, won)\n7. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, lost)\n8. Opponent: rock (I played paper, lost)\n9. Opponent: paper (I played paper, tie)\n10. Opponent: scissors (I played rock, lost)\n11. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, won)\n12. Opponent: scissors (I played scissors, but according to the last hint, I played scissors and they played rock, which I lost. Wait, maybe there's a discrepancy here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent's moves are: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors. So after scissors, they go to rock, then paper, then scissors, etc. But the last move was scissors, so next would be rock again. \n\nIf that's the case, then their next move is rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the previous round, when I played scissors, they played rock. If their next move is paper (following the cycle), then I should play scissors. But if they're repeating the cycle, after rock comes paper. So if their last move was rock, next is paper. Wait, their last move was scissors (in the last round), so next would be rock. \n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me list the opponent's moves in order based on the hints:\n\n1. scissors (Round 1)\n2. rock (Round 2)\n3. paper (Round 3)\n4. scissors (Round 4)\n5. rock (Round 5)\n6. paper (Round 6)\n7. scissors (Round 7)\n8. rock (Round 8)\n9. paper (Round 9 - tie)\n10. scissors (Round 10)\n11. rock (Round 11)\n12. scissors (Round 12)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. If they're cycling scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, then after Round 9 (paper), next would be scissors (Round 10), then rock (Round 11), then paper (Round 12). But according to the hints, in Round 12, they played scissors again. So maybe the cycle is not strict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is alternating between scissors and rock. Let's see their moves:\n\nscissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors. \n\nIt seems like after paper, they go back to scissors. So the cycle is scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors... \n\nIf that's the case, then after scissors (Round 12), the next move would be rock. So I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nBut in the last round, they played scissors, so next would be rock. Therefore, I should play paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my moves. For example, if I tend to play the move that would beat their last move. For instance, if they played rock last time, I might play paper, so they play scissors next. \n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Another approach is to look for patterns in their responses. For example, after losing with scissors, they switched to rock. After losing with rock, they switched to paper. After losing with paper, they switched to scissors. So they cycle through the moves in order when they lose. \n\nBut when they win, they might stick with the same move. For example, when they played scissors and won (Round 1), but in Round 2, they played rock. Wait, no, in Round 1, I won, so they lost. Then in Round 2, they played rock. If they lost, they cycle to the next move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"rotate on loss\" strategy. Each time they lose, they switch to the next move in the cycle. If they win or tie, they keep the same move. \n\nLet's test this:\n\nRound 1: Opponent plays scissors (loses) \u2192 next move rock\nRound 2: Opponent plays rock (loses) \u2192 next move paper\nRound 3: Opponent plays paper (wins) \u2192 keep paper\nRound 4: Opponent plays paper (but according to history, they played scissors in Round 4. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this approach isn't matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, playing whatever move I played last. But looking at the moves:\n\nRound 1: I played paper \u2192 opponent played scissors (not tit-for-tat)\nRound 2: I played scissors \u2192 opponent played rock (not tit-for-tat)\nRound 3: I played scissors \u2192 opponent played paper (not tit-for-tat)\nSo that's not it. \n\nAnother possibility: the opponent is using a random move generator. But given the sequence, it's more likely a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is trying to counter my most frequent move. If I play paper often, they play scissors. But I've played paper several times, and they sometimes play scissors, sometimes rock. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy. If they win, they keep the same move; if they lose, they switch. Let's check:\n\nRound 1: Opponent played scissors (lost) \u2192 shift to rock\nRound 2: Opponent played rock (lost) \u2192 shift to paper\nRound 3: Opponent played paper (won) \u2192 stay on paper\nRound 4: Opponent should play paper again, but they played scissors. So this doesn't fit. \n\nThus, this strategy doesn't hold. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to predict that the opponent will continue their cycle. Their last move was scissors (in the last round), so next would be rock. Therefore, I should play paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, if they're alternating between scissors and rock, then after scissors comes rock, then scissors again. But in the last round, they played scissors, so next would be rock. \n\nTherefore, the best move is paper.\n",

So if they play rock, and I play paper, they get 1 point, I get -1. If they play scissors, I play paper, I get 1. So playing paper is a safe move if I think they might play scissors again, but risky if they switch to rock. Alternatively, if I play scissors, I can beat paper if they switch to paper, but lose to rock. If I play rock, I beat scissors if they play scissors again, but lose to paper.\n\nGiven the opponent's history, they have been cycling through scissors, rock, paper, but recently they played scissors twice. Maybe they're breaking the cycle. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I played rock, they played scissors (they won). Then I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then I played rock, they played scissors (they won). Then I played scissors, they played rock (they won). Then I played paper, they played rock (they won). Then I played rock, they played scissors (they won). Then I played paper, they played paper (tie). Then I played rock, they played scissors (they won). Then I played scissors, they played rock (they won). Then I played paper, they played scissors (they won). Then I played rock, they played scissors (they won). \n\nThis pattern suggests that the opponent is often countering my previous move. For example, when I play rock, they play paper; when I play paper, they play scissors; when I play scissors, they play rock. But looking at the actual moves:\n\nFor example, when I played paper, they played scissors (countering with scissors, which beats paper). Then I played scissors, they played rock (countering with rock, which beats scissors). Then I played scissors again, they played paper (which loses to scissors, so that's not a counter). Hmm, inconsistent. Maybe they're not strictly countering, but sometimes following a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my previous move. For example, if I played paper last time, they play scissors (to beat paper). If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. Let's check:\n\nLooking at my previous move and their response:\n\n1. I played paper, they played scissors (scissors beat paper)\n2. I played scissors, they played rock (rock beats scissors)\n3. I played scissors, they played paper (paper loses to scissors)\n4. I played paper, they played scissors (scissors beat paper)\n5. I played paper, they played rock (rock beats paper)\n6. I played rock, they played paper (paper beats rock)\n7. I played rock, they played scissors (scissors beat rock)\n8. I played paper, they played rock (rock beats paper)\n9. I played paper, they played paper (tie)\n10. I played rock, they played scissors (scissors beat rock)\n11. I played scissors, they played rock (rock beats scissors)\n12. I played paper, they played scissors (scissors beat paper)\n13. I played rock, they played scissors (scissors beat rock)\n\nSo in most cases, when I played a move, they played the move that beats it. For example:\n\n- I play paper, they play scissors (beat paper)\n- I play scissors, they play rock (beat scissors)\n- I play rock, they play paper (beat rock)\n\nBut in move 3, I played scissors, and they played paper, which loses to scissors. That's an exception. Similarly, move 9 was a tie. So maybe the opponent is mostly trying to counter my last move by playing the move that beats it, but sometimes makes a mistake or varies.\n\nIf that's the case, then to counter their strategy, I should play the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if they expect me to play what I played last time, and they counter that, I can play the move that beats their counter.\n\nFor instance, if I last played rock, they expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. To counter that, I should play scissors (which beats paper). But if they are countering my last move, then:\n\nMy last move was rock. They would expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nBut in the last round, I played rock, and they played scissors. Wait, that contradicts the pattern. If they were countering my last move (rock), they should have played paper. But they played scissors, which beats rock. So maybe they're not countering, but following a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a rotating counter. For example, after a loss, they switch to the next move in the cycle. It's getting a bit confusing.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. The last two moves were scissors. Before that, the pattern was scissors, rock, paper repeating. But the last two scissors breaks that. Maybe they're sticking with scissors now. If they play scissors again, I should play paper. If they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they follow the previous cycle (scissors, rock, paper), after two scissors, maybe they go back to rock. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they've played scissors three times in the last four moves (moves 10, 12, 13: scissors, scissors, scissors), maybe they're favoring scissors. If that's the case, playing paper would be good to beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, paper loses. However, given that they've been playing scissors frequently, it's worth the risk to play paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves have been a bit cyclical. Let me try to track their pattern.\n\nStarting from the first round, they played scissors, then rock, then paper, scissors again, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, and so on. It seems like they might be cycling through the moves in a particular order. But maybe there's a pattern based on previous outcomes.\n\nWait, after each loss, they might be switching to the move that beats what they just played. For example, when they lost with scissors (against my paper), they switched to rock. Then when they lost with rock (against my scissors), they switched to paper. Then when they lost with paper (against my rock), they switched to scissors again. So it's like they're following a cycle of scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors, etc.\n\nBut in the last few rounds, after I played paper and they tied, they went back to scissors. Then when I played rock, they played scissors again. Hmm, maybe they're sticking with scissors after a tie. Then when I played paper again, they went back to rock. It's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper, they might play scissors next. But when I played scissors, they played rock, which does beat scissors. Then when I played rock, they played paper. So that seems to fit. So their next move is the one that beats my previous move.\n\nWait, let's check the history:\n\nMy moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper.\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nLooking at the last few rounds:\n\nWhen I played paper, they played rock (I lost). Then I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper, they played rock again (I lost). Then I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost). Then I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Wait, that's a lot of rocks from them. Maybe they're sticking with rock because it's been working against my recent choices.\n\nBut in the last round, I played paper, and they played rock again. So they might be stuck on rock. Maybe they think I'm going to play scissors again, so they keep choosing rock. But I keep switching between paper and scissors, and they keep choosing rock. Wait, no, in the last round, when I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost). Then I played scissors again, they played rock again (I lost). Then I played paper, they played rock again. So they're consistently choosing rock, expecting me to play scissors again. But I keep switching, and they're not adjusting.\n\nWait, but in the previous rounds, after they lost with scissors, they switched to rock. Then after losing with rock, they switched to paper, then back to scissors. But recently, they've been choosing rock multiple times. Maybe their strategy is to counter my most frequent move. If I've been playing paper and scissors a lot, they might default to rock to counter scissors. But I need to break this cycle.\n\nIf they're consistently choosing rock now, I should play paper to beat it. But in the last round, I did play paper, and they played rock, so I won. Wait, no, the last round when I played paper, they played rock, and I won. But according to the history, the last move was me playing paper, opponent rock, I won. Then the next round, I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper, they played rock (I won). Then I played scissors again, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper again, they played rock (I won). So they keep switching between rock and something else? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list the last few interactions:\n\n1. I played paper, opponent scissors: I won (1-0)\n2. I played scissors, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n3. I played scissors, opponent paper: I won (1)\n4. I played paper, opponent scissors: I won (1)\n5. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n6. I played rock, opponent paper: I won (1)\n7. I played rock, opponent scissors: I lost (-1)\n8. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n9. I played paper, opponent paper: tie (0)\n10. I played rock, opponent scissors: I lost (-1)\n11. I played scissors, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n12. I played scissors, opponent paper: I won (1)\n13. I played paper, opponent paper: tie (0)\n14. I played rock, opponent scissors: I lost (-1)\n15. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n16. I played scissors, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n17. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n18. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n19. I played scissors, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n20. I played paper, opponent rock: I lost (-1)\n\nWait, this can't be right. The opponent seems to be choosing rock a lot, especially in the recent rounds. If they keep choosing rock, I should play paper to beat it. But in the last few attempts, when I played paper, they played rock, so I won. But according to the user's message history, after I played paper, they sometimes played rock and sometimes scissors. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the sequence.\n\nLooking back at the actual interaction:\n\nAfter the initial rounds, the opponent's moves were: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock.\n\nIn the last few rounds, the opponent has been playing rock repeatedly. For example, when I played scissors, they played rock; when I played paper, they played rock again. So they might be stuck on rock. If that's the case, I should switch to paper to beat rock. But in the last round, I played paper, and they played rock, so I won. Then the next round, I played scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then I played paper again, they played rock (I won). But according to the user's latest message, after I played paper, they played rock again, and I lost. Wait, that doesn't make sense because paper beats rock. Maybe there's a mistake in the history.\n\nWait, the user's latest message says:\n\n\"You lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -1 points.\"\n\nBut paper beats rock, so that should be a win. Maybe there's a typo in the user's message. Alternatively, perhaps the opponent played scissors, which would beat paper. Let me check the exact sequence.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe user's previous message was:\n\n\"[hint] Move made. Waiting for the game to end.\n\nYou lost the round. You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock.\nYou scored -1 points.\n\nLet's play another round. Please make your move.\"\n\nBut according to the rules, paper beats rock, so this should be a win. There's a contradiction here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the hint, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the opponent's move. Alternatively, maybe the opponent played scissors instead of rock, and it's a typo. But assuming the hint is correct, if the opponent played rock and I played paper, I should have won. But the hint says I lost, which implies that the opponent's move was scissors. So perhaps there's a typo in the user's message, and the opponent actually played scissors, not rock. Alternatively, the scoring is reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's system has a bug. But given the information, I have to proceed with what's provided. If the opponent played rock and I played paper, but I lost, that's impossible under the standard rules. Therefore, it's likely a typo, and the opponent actually played scissors. So in that case, when I played paper, they played scissors, hence I lost. That makes sense. So the opponent's move was scissors, not rock. So the user's message had a typo, and the opponent's actual move was scissors.\n\nGiven that, the opponent's recent moves might be scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc. But in the last round, they played scissors (beating my paper). So now, if they beat my paper with scissors, they might expect me to play rock next to counter their scissors. So they might play paper to counter my anticipated rock. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nAlternatively, if they're following a pattern of cycling through moves, after scissors comes rock, then paper, then scissors again. So after scissors, they might play rock. So I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nBut given the confusion in the hint, it's hard to track. Let's try to base the decision on the most recent accurate data. Assuming the opponent's last move was scissors (since they beat my paper), then their next move might be rock (following the cycle). So I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nAlternatively, if they're reacting to my moves, since I played paper last, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the opponent is using a simple strategy like always playing the move that beats my last move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors. If I played scissors, they play rock. If I played rock, they play paper. In that case, to counter, I should play the move that beats their expected move. So if they're playing scissors to beat my paper, I should play rock to beat their scissors. But if they're following that pattern, then after I played paper, they play scissors. Then I play rock, they play paper. Then I play scissors, they play rock, etc. So it's a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, if the opponent is using a tit-for-tat strategy, playing what beat my last move. So to counter, I can cycle through the moves that beat their expected move.\n\nBut given the recent history, if the opponent's last move was scissors (beating my paper), then their next move might be rock (to beat my scissors if I switch). But if I played rock, they might play paper. So perhaps I should play scissors to beat their paper. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has been alternating between scissors and rock recently, maybe they'll switch back to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent has beaten my paper with scissors, then my scissors with rock, then my paper with rock (if there was a typo), maybe they're sticking with rock. So I should play paper again to beat rock.\n\nBut given the confusion in the last hint, it's challenging. The safest bet might be to assume that the opponent is cycling through the moves in a predictable pattern and adjust accordingly. If they played scissors last, next is rock, so I play paper. If they played rock, next is paper, so I play scissors. If they played paper, next is scissors, so I play rock.\n\nAlternatively, if they're reacting to my moves, I need to anticipate their counter. Since I played paper last and they beat it with scissors, they might expect me to play rock next, so they'll play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper.\n\nBut this is a lot of guesswork. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again, but that's risky. Alternatively, stick with paper to beat their possible rock.\n\nWait, in the last round, according to the user's message, I played paper, and they played rock, but I lost. That's impossible unless there's a mistake. So likely, the opponent actually played scissors, and the user's message had a typo. So assuming that, the opponent's last move was scissors. Therefore, following the cycle, they might play rock next. So I should play paper to beat rock.\n\nBut if they're following a different pattern, like repeating scissors, then I should play rock. But since they just played scissors (assuming the typo), they might switch to rock. So paper is the safe choice.\n\nAlternatively, if they're alternating between scissors and rock, then after scissors comes rock, then scissors again. So if they played scissors last, next is rock. So paper beats rock.\n\nTherefore, the best move is paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against an opponent, and they need to decide their next move. The history of moves and outcomes is crucial here. Let me recap the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nStarting from the first move, the user chose paper, and the opponent picked scissors. The user won that round. Then, the user chose scissors, expecting the opponent to switch to rock, which they did, leading to another win. The next round, the user went with scissors again, but the opponent chose paper, resulting in a loss. \n\nAfter that, the user predicted the opponent would go back to scissors and chose paper, which worked. Then, the user chose paper again, but the opponent picked rock, causing a loss. The user then switched to rock, expecting the opponent to choose paper, which they did, leading to a win. \n\nNext, the user chose rock again, but the opponent picked scissors, resulting in a loss. The user then went back to paper, but the opponent chose rock again, another loss. There was a tie when both chose paper, then the user chose rock, opponent scissors (loss), then scissors against rock (win), paper leading to a tie, rock leading to loss, paper again leading to a tie, and so on.\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, there's a cycle here. The opponent seems to be following a pattern: scissors, rock, paper, repeating every three moves. Let me check:\n\nRound 1: scissors\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: paper\nRound 4: scissors\nRound 5: rock\nRound 6: paper\nRound 7: scissors\nRound 8: rock\nRound 9: paper\nRound 10: scissors\nRound 11: rock\nRound 12: paper\nRound 13: scissors\nRound 14: rock\n\nYes, the opponent is cycling through scissors, rock, paper in that order. If this pattern continues, the next move after rock (Round 14) should be paper. So, the user should choose scissors to beat paper. But wait, in the last few rounds, the user tried predicting based on the cycle but sometimes the opponent stuck with the same move. For example, after the user chose paper and tied, the opponent might have stayed on paper, but the user chose rock next, leading to a loss. Hmm, maybe the opponent's cycle is consistent.\n\nIf the opponent is indeed following scissors, rock, paper, repeating, then after the last move of rock (Round 14), the next should be paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors to beat paper. But let me confirm the pattern again. The opponent's moves in order: S, R, P, S, R, P, S, R, P, S, R, P, S, R. So next is P. So scissors would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to the user's moves. For example, when the user plays paper, the opponent plays rock, but that might not fit the cycle. Wait, in Round 14, the user played paper, opponent played rock. Then the user played paper again, leading to a tie. Then rock, opponent scissors. Then scissors, opponent rock. Then paper, opponent rock again. Hmm, maybe the opponent is not strictly following a cycle but reacting to the user's previous moves. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent could be using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten the user's last move. For example, if the user played paper, the opponent might play scissors next. But looking at the history, when the user played paper, the opponent sometimes played scissors, sometimes rock. It's a bit inconsistent. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest bet is to assume the opponent is cycling through S, R, P. Since the last opponent move was rock, the next should be paper. Therefore, the user should choose scissors. But in the last round where the user chose paper, the opponent also chose paper, leading to a tie. Then the user chose rock, opponent scissors. Wait, that breaks the cycle. Maybe the opponent's pattern changed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. For example, after the user plays paper multiple times, the opponent starts choosing scissors. But the user's moves have been varying. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look for the most recent pattern. The last few opponent moves were rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, that doesn't fit the initial cycle. Maybe the opponent is now alternating between rock and scissors. Let's see:\n\nLast few opponent moves: rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Hmm, not a clear pattern. Alternatively, after the user's last move was paper (tie), then rock (loss), then scissors (win), then paper (tie), then rock (loss), then paper (tie), then rock (loss). The opponent seems to be choosing rock more frequently recently. \n\nIf the opponent is favoring rock, then the user should play paper. But in the last round, the user played paper, and the opponent also played paper, leading to a tie. Then the user played rock, opponent scissors. Then scissors, opponent rock. Then paper, opponent rock. So opponent's recent moves: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Wait, that's the same S, R, P cycle but starting from paper. Maybe the cycle shifted. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent is now cycling through paper, scissors, rock. If that's the case, after rock, the next would be paper again. So the user should play scissors. But this is speculative. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, expecting the opponent to play paper based on the initial cycle. Alternatively, if the opponent is sticking with rock, then paper would be better. But the last opponent move was rock, and if they continue the cycle, next is paper. So scissors. But the user has tried that before and sometimes it worked, sometimes not. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be reacting to the user's previous move. The user's last move was paper, which tied, then rock, which lost, then scissors, which won, then paper, which tied, then rock, which lost, then paper, which tied. The opponent might expect the user to switch to rock again, so they play scissors. But the user could counter with rock. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to go back to the initial cycle. If the opponent is cycling S, R, P, then after the last move of rock, next is paper. Therefore, scissors. But let's check the history again. \n\nLooking back:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. \n\nYes, that's a clear cycle of three: S, R, P, repeating. So after rock comes paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut in the last round, the user played paper, opponent played rock. Then the user played paper again, opponent paper (tie). Then rock, opponent scissors. Then scissors, opponent rock. Then paper, opponent rock. Wait, the opponent's moves after the initial cycle seem to have changed. Maybe the cycle was disrupted. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might have a longer cycle or a different pattern. It's possible that after a few cycles, the opponent changes strategy. \n\nGiven the inconsistency in recent rounds, perhaps the user should try to counter the most frequent recent moves. The last few opponent moves were rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. Rock appears three times, scissors twice, paper once. So rock is more common. To counter rock, the user should play paper. \n\nBut in the last round, the user played paper, and the opponent also played paper, leading to a tie. Then the user played rock, opponent scissors. Then scissors, opponent rock. Then paper, opponent rock. So opponent's recent rock choices: three times in the last four moves. Maybe the opponent is favoring rock. Therefore, playing paper would be good, but if the opponent continues with rock, paper would tie or win. Wait, paper beats rock. If the opponent plays rock, and user plays paper, user wins. But in the last round, user played paper and opponent played rock, resulting in a win. Wait, no, in the last round, user played paper, opponent rock: user wins. But according to the history, the user lost that round. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the history:\n\nRound 14: User played paper, opponent rock. Result: user lost? Wait, no. Paper beats rock, so user should have won. But according to the hints, in one round, the user played paper and opponent rock, and the user scored -1. That must be a mistake. Wait, let me check the exact history:\n\nLooking at the user's message history, the rounds went like this:\n\n1. User: paper vs scissors \u2192 win\n2. User: scissors vs rock \u2192 win\n3. User: scissors vs paper \u2192 loss\n4. User: paper vs scissors \u2192 win\n5. User: paper vs rock \u2192 loss\n6. User: rock vs paper \u2192 win\n7. User: rock vs scissors \u2192 loss\n8. User: paper vs rock \u2192 loss\n9. User: paper vs paper \u2192 tie\n10. User: rock vs scissors \u2192 loss\n11. User: scissors vs rock \u2192 win\n12. User: paper vs rock \u2192 loss\n13. User: paper vs paper \u2192 tie\n14. User: rock vs scissors \u2192 loss\n15. User: paper vs rock \u2192 loss\n16. User: paper vs paper \u2192 tie\n17. User: rock vs scissors \u2192 loss\n18. User: scissors vs rock \u2192 win\n19. User: paper vs rock \u2192 loss\n20. User: paper vs paper \u2192 tie\n\nWait, this is confusing. The opponent's move when the user played paper and lost would mean the opponent played scissors, but in some cases, the user played paper against opponent's rock and lost, which shouldn't happen. There might be a mistake in the history tracking. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error in recalling the outcomes. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest assumption is that the opponent is cycling through scissors, rock, paper. If the last opponent move was rock, the next should be paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors. However, in the most recent rounds, after the user played paper, the opponent played rock, leading to a loss (which shouldn't happen if paper beats rock). This inconsistency suggests there might be a different pattern or a change in the opponent's strategy. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be mirroring the user's previous move. For example, if the user plays paper, the opponent plays paper next. But looking at the history, that doesn't hold consistently. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to switch strategies. Since the opponent has been choosing rock frequently, the user could play paper to counter. However, in the last round where the user played paper, the opponent also played paper, leading to a tie. If the opponent is likely to repeat paper, then the user should play scissors. But if the opponent switches back to rock, paper would be better. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma where predicting the opponent's next move is challenging. Without a clear pattern, the optimal strategy might be to randomize moves to avoid being predictable. However, since the user is trying to maximize points, they need to detect any exploitable pattern. \n\nGiven the initial cycle and the recent possible deviation, the user might assume the opponent is returning to the cycle. If the last opponent move was rock, next is paper. Therefore, scissors would be the optimal choice. But given that in the last similar situation, the opponent might have broken the cycle, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, the user could try to counter the most recent move. If the opponent played rock last, they might expect the user to play paper and thus switch to scissors. To counter that, the user could play rock. But this is getting into second-level thinking. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the opponent's initial cycle and the possibility they resumed it after deviations, the next move after rock would be paper. Therefore, the user should play scissors.\n",

Then I tried rock again, thinking they might go scissors, but they did scissors again. Then I went to paper, expecting rock, but they played rock again. Then scissors, expecting rock, but they played scissors. Then paper again, which tied. Then rock, but they played scissors again. Then paper, but they played rock. Then paper again, which tied. Then scissors, which tied again.\n\nHmm, the opponent seems to be cycling through scissors, rock, paper, but sometimes repeating. After scissors, they went rock, then paper, then scissors again. But there's inconsistency. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). Then when I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors). Then when I played scissors again, they played paper (loses to scissors). Wait, that's inconsistent. Maybe they're not following a strict cycle but reacting to my moves. Let me check:\n\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (counter to paper).\n- Then I played scissors, they played rock (counter to scissors).\n- Then I played scissors again, they played paper (losing to scissors, which is unexpected).\n- Then I played paper, they played scissors again (counter to paper).\n- Then I played paper again, they played rock (counter to paper).\n- Then I played rock, they played paper (counter to rock).\n- Then I played rock again, they played scissors (counter to rock).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (counter to paper).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (counter to rock).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (counter to paper).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n\nWait, this seems like the opponent is trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors next. If I play scissors, they play rock. If I play rock, they play paper. But sometimes they repeat. Let me test this hypothesis. The last few moves: \n\nMy last move was scissors (tie), then I played paper (they played rock), then paper again (tie), then scissors (they played scissors). Wait, maybe they're not strictly countering but have a different pattern. Alternatively, they might be cycling through their own sequence regardless of my moves. Let's see their moves in order:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors.\n\nHmm, that's not a clear cycle. Maybe they alternate between countering my last move and following their own cycle. Alternatively, they might be using a strategy where they switch to beat whatever beat them last. For example, if they lost with scissors to my paper, they might switch to rock (which beats scissors, but I played paper again). Wait, that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a \"win-stay, lose-shift\" strategy. Let's check:\n\nAfter they won with scissors (against my paper), they next played rock (which is a shift, but scissors would have stayed). Then they lost with rock against my scissors, so they shifted to paper. Then they lost with paper against my scissors, shifted to scissors. Then won with scissors against my paper, stayed? But next they played rock, which is a shift. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to detect a pattern in their last few moves. The last three moves were rock, scissors, scissors. Before that, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock. It's hard to see a clear pattern. Maybe they're favoring scissors and rock more than paper. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. \n\nLooking at my own moves: I've been switching between paper, scissors, rock, trying to anticipate their cycle. But since they sometimes counter and sometimes repeat, it's tricky. Maybe I should try to break the cycle by choosing a move that counters their most frequent recent choices. Let's count their recent moves:\n\nLast 5 moves: scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock. Scissors appears 3 times, rock 2. So maybe they're favoring scissors. If that's the case, playing rock would beat scissors. But in the last round, I played scissors and they played scissors (tie). Before that, I played paper and they played rock. Wait, if they're favoring scissors, but in the last round they played scissors again, maybe they're sticking with scissors. So playing rock would beat scissors. But I need to check if they might switch to rock to counter my potential rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll play rock to beat their scissors, they might play paper. But this is getting into second-level thinking. \n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors three times in the last five moves, maybe they're more likely to play scissors again. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock, they might switch to paper. Hmm. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. Without a clear pattern, maybe the best strategy is to randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But since the opponent might have a pattern, I need to find it. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two moves were scissors and scissors, maybe they're repeating. If they play scissors again, I should play rock. But if they switch to rock, I should play paper. But I don't know. Maybe I should play paper, expecting them to play rock again, as they did after the last tie. Wait, in the last round, after a tie with scissors, they played scissors again. Then when I played paper, they played rock. Then when I played paper again, they played rock again. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the last few rounds:\n\n- I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost).\n- Then I played paper again, they played rock again (I lost).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n- Then I played rock, they played scissors (I lost).\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost).\n- Then I played scissors, they played scissors (tie).\n\nSo after the tie with scissors, they played rock when I played paper. Then when I played paper again, they played rock again. Then when I played scissors, they played scissors again. So maybe after a tie, they switch to the move that would beat my previous move. For example, after a tie with scissors, I played paper, they played rock (which beats scissors). Then I played paper again, they played rock again. Then I played scissors, they played scissors. So maybe they're sticking with rock when I play paper, and scissors when I play scissors. \n\nIf that's the case, if I played scissors last time and they played scissors (tie), then next if I play rock, they might play paper to beat my rock. But in the previous instance, after a tie with scissors, I played paper and they played rock. So maybe they counter my previous move. If I played scissors last, they might expect me to play rock next (to beat their scissors), so they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, since they played rock the last two times I played paper, maybe they expect me to play paper again and will counter with rock. So I should play scissors to beat their rock. Wait, but in the last round, I played paper and they played rock, so if I play scissors now, they might expect me to switch and play rock to beat scissors. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest move is to play rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But they might have noticed I played paper twice in a row and adjusted. Alternatively, since they've been playing rock when I play paper, maybe I should play scissors to beat their rock. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent's moves have been a bit cyclical. They started with scissors, then rock, paper, scissors again, rock, scissors, paper, and so on. But there's a pattern here. After losing with scissors, they switched to rock, then paper, then scissors again. It seems like they might be cycling through the moves in order: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n\nWait, in the last few rounds, when I played paper, they played rock, which I lost. Then when I played scissors, they also played scissors, leading to a tie. Then I played paper again, and they played rock again. So maybe they're sticking with rock after a win? Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back:\n- When I played paper, they played scissors (I won).\n- Then scissors vs their rock (I lost).\n- Then scissors vs their paper (I won).\n- Then paper vs their scissors (I won).\n- Then paper vs their rock (I lost).\n- Then rock vs their scissors (I lost).\n- Then scissors vs their rock (I won).\n- Then paper vs their rock (I lost).\n- Then scissors vs their scissors (tie).\n- Then paper vs their rock (I lost again).\n\nHmm, it's inconsistent. Maybe they're not following a strict cycle. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my previous moves. For example, after I play paper, they switch to rock to beat me. But when I played scissors, they played rock again. Wait, no, when I played scissors, they played rock once and then scissors another time. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nIf I played paper, they played rock (countering paper with rock). Then when I played scissors, they played rock again. Then when I played scissors again, they played paper. Then when I played paper, they played scissors. It's a bit confusing. Maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I played paper, they play scissors next time. But that doesn't always hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a simple rotation. Let's see their moves in order: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper. Wait, that's a cycle of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors. So every three moves, they cycle through. If that's the case, after paper, they go back to scissors. But in the last few rounds, after paper, they played rock again. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. For example, if I play paper, they play scissors; if I play scissors, they play rock; if I play rock, they play paper. But looking at the history:\n\nMy moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n\nTheir responses: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\nWait, when I played paper, they played scissors (beat me), then when I played scissors, they played rock (beat me), then scissors again, they played paper (I won). Then paper, they played scissors (I won). Then rock, they played scissors (I lost). Then scissors, they played rock (I lost). Then paper, they played rock (I lost). Then scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then paper, they played rock again (I lost). Then scissors, they played rock again (I lost). Then paper, they played rock again (I lost). Then scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then paper, they played rock again. So it seems like after I play paper, they tend to play rock. When I play scissors, they sometimes play rock or scissors. When I play rock, they play scissors.\n\nSo maybe the opponent is countering my previous move. For example, if I play paper, they play rock (to beat scissors, but wait, paper beats rock. Wait, no. If I play paper, they should play scissors to beat me. But in the first move, when I played paper, they played scissors, which I beat. Then when I played scissors, they played rock, which beats scissors. Then when I played scissors again, they played paper, which I beat. Then when I played paper, they played scissors again. So maybe they're trying to counter my previous move by playing what would have beaten it. For example, if I played paper (which beats rock), they play scissors (which beats paper). If I played scissors (beats paper), they play rock (beats scissors). If I played rock (beats scissors), they play paper (beats rock). But in practice, sometimes they repeat moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, if I last played paper, they play scissors. If I last played scissors, they play rock. If I last played rock, they play paper. Let's check:\n\nAfter I played paper, they played scissors (correct counter). Then I played scissors, they played rock (correct). Then I played scissors again, they played paper (incorrect, should be rock again). Hmm, inconsistency there. Then I played paper, they played scissors (correct). Then I played rock, they played scissors (incorrect, should be paper). Then I played scissors, they played rock (correct). Then I played paper, they played rock (incorrect, should be scissors). Then I played scissors, they played scissors (incorrect, should be rock). Then I played paper, they played rock (incorrect). So maybe they're not consistently countering my last move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a fixed pattern. For example, scissors, rock, paper, repeating. Let's see their moves:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc. But looking at the actual history:\n\nTheir moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock.\n\nNo, it's not a clean cycle. It seems more random. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves based on my previous patterns. For example, if I tend to play paper after a loss, they might counter that. But I need to find a pattern in their moves to predict the next one.\n\nLooking at the last few moves:\n\nTheir recent moves: rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock. So they're alternating between rock and scissors. If that's the case, the next move might be scissors again. But wait, the last move was rock, so next would be scissors. If I play paper, paper beats rock, but if they switch to scissors, scissors beat paper. Wait, but if they're alternating, after rock comes scissors. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors. But if they continue the pattern, next is scissors. So playing rock would beat scissors. Alternatively, if they break the pattern and play paper, then rock loses to paper. But given they've been alternating rock and scissors, maybe they'll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I tend to play paper after a loss, so they play rock to counter. But in the last round, I played paper, they played rock. If I play scissors now, scissors beat paper, but if they play rock again, I lose. If they switch to paper, scissors lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with rock because it's been working. They played rock three times in a row when I played paper. So if I play paper again, they might play rock again. But if I switch to scissors, scissors beat paper, but if they play rock, I lose. Alternatively, play rock to beat their scissors if they switch.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to break their pattern. If they've been playing rock a lot recently, maybe I should play paper to beat it. But they might expect that and switch to scissors. Alternatively, play scissors to beat their possible paper. But given their recent moves were rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, maybe they'll play scissors next. So rock would beat scissors. But if they continue the rock-scissors alternation, next is scissors. So rock would win. Alternatively, if they break the pattern and play paper, rock loses. But given the recent trend, scissors is more likely. So play rock.\n\nWait, but in the last round, they played rock when I played paper. If I play scissors now, scissors would lose to rock. If I play rock, it's a tie. If I play paper, paper beats rock. But they might expect me to switch to paper again and counter with scissors. Hmm. This is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves and counter it. If they're alternating between rock and scissors, next is scissors. So play rock. But if they break the pattern, it's risky. Alternatively, since they've been playing rock a lot, maybe paper is safe. But they might anticipate that. Alternatively, use a mixed strategy to avoid being predictable. But since this is a text-based interaction, maybe the opponent has a fixed pattern. Let me try to play paper again, expecting them to play rock again. If they do, I win. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But given they've played rock the last three times when I played paper, maybe they'll stick with rock. So I'll go with paper.\n",

Opponent: rock (I played scissors, lost)\n3. Opponent: paper (I played scissors, lost)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I played paper, won)\n5. Opponent: rock (I played scissors, lost)\n6.

Then when I play scissors, they play rock, which beats me. Then when I play scissors again, they play paper, which I lose to. Then I play paper again, they play scissors, and so on. So the pattern is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc. So if their last move was paper, the next should be scissors. Wait, no, the cycle is scissors, rock, paper, then back to scissors.

For example, when I played paper, they played scissors (which beats paper). When I played scissors, they played rock (which beats scissors). When I played scissors again, they played paper (which beats scissors). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If I played scissors, they should play rock to beat it. But in one case, after I played scissors, they played paper. Hmm, maybe they're not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a tit-for-tat strategy, mirroring my last move.

If I tend to play paper after a win, they might counter that. But I need to find a way to outguess them. \n\nGiven that they seem to cycle through scissors, rock, paper, the next move after paper would be scissors. So I should play rock.

It's a game of predicting each other's predictions. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to assume they continue their cycle. Since their last move was paper, next is scissors. So play rock. But in the previous instances, after paper they went back to scissors. So rock would be the move. Alternatively, if they break the cycle, maybe they stick with paper. But that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, considering that when I played paper, they played scissors, and when I played scissors, they played rock, maybe they are always playing the move that beats my last move. So if my last move was scissors, they play rock. If my last move was paper, they play scissors. If my last move was rock, they play paper. In that case, to counter, I should play the move that beats what they would play. For example, if my last move was scissors, they play rock, so I should play paper to beat their rock. But in the last round, I played scissors and they played paper, which doesn't fit. Wait, no, when I played scissors, they played paper once and rock another time. So maybe their strategy isn't consistent. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look at the recent history. The last few moves:\n\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I won)\n- I played scissors, they played rock (I lost)\n- I played scissors, they played paper (I lost)\n- I played paper, they played scissors (I won)\n- ... and so on.\n\nIt seems like whenever I play paper, they play scissors, which I beat. When I play scissors, they sometimes play rock or paper. Maybe they are alternating between rock and paper when I play scissors. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a fixed pattern regardless of my moves. Their pattern is scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc. So after paper comes scissors. Therefore, next move is scissors. So I should play rock. But in the last round, they played paper, so next is scissors. Rock beats scissors. \n\nAlternatively, if they are cycling, then after paper comes scissors. So I play rock. But if they are not cycling, maybe they stick with paper. Then rock would lose to paper. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that I tend to play paper after a win, so they'll play scissors again. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they play paper. Then I should play scissors. \n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume they continue the cycle. So after paper comes scissors. Play rock. But given that they sometimes break the cycle, maybe not. Alternatively, since they've been following scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, the next should be scissors. So rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was scissors (I lost), so they might expect me to switch. If I played scissors last and lost, maybe I'll switch to rock. So they would play paper to beat rock. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. Maybe the safest bet is to play rock, expecting their scissors. But given the previous instances where after paper they played scissors, then after scissors they played rock, then after rock they played paper, it's a cycle. So after paper comes scissors. Therefore, rock.\n",

So maybe they're not countering but following their own cycle. This is confusing. Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors.\n\nWait, maybe they're alternating between scissors and rock, then paper. Or perhaps they have a different pattern. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played rock. When I played rock, they played paper. So they're always countering my previous move. If that's the case, then whatever I played last, they'll counter it. So if I played rock last time, they'll play paper next. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their expected paper. But in the last round, I played rock, and they played scissors, which beat me. That doesn't fit the countering pattern. Hmm. Maybe they're not countering but following their own sequence. Let me see the sequence again:\n\nOpponent's moves in order: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors.\n\nIt's a bit irregular. Maybe they're cycling through scissors, rock, paper, but sometimes repeating. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. For example, if I tend to play paper after a loss, they might counter that. But I need to find a pattern. Alternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, if they played scissors and lost, they might play rock next. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that the last move was scissors (they played scissors, I played rock and lost), maybe they'll stick with scissors again, thinking I might switch to paper. If they play scissors again, I should play rock. But if they expect me to play rock again, they might play paper. Alternatively, if they follow the cycle, after scissors comes rock.

But in the last round, they played scissors, and I played rock, which lost. So if they follow the cycle, they'll play rock next. Therefore, I should play paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors again. This is tricky. Maybe I should randomize my moves to avoid being predictable. But given the history, the safest bet is to assume they follow the cycle and play rock next. So I should play paper. Alternatively, if they're countering my previous move (I played rock last), they might play paper, so I should play scissors. But I'm not sure.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
