The goal is to maximize points based on the move outcomes.\n\nFirst, I remember that new players often start with rock because it's the most straightforward choice. So if the opponent picks rock, choosing paper would give the highest points (3) since paper beats rock. But I need to make sure that's the case. Let me check the rules again: paper beats rock for 3 points, rock beats scissors for 1 point, scissors beat paper for 1 point. Yep, paper against rock gives the best reward here.\n\nBut wait, maybe the new player is trying to outsmart by not choosing rock. However, since they're new, they might not have a strategy yet. The safest bet is still to assume they'll pick rock. So going with paper seems like the optimal move here. I should explain that in the move message, but according to the correction, the explanation should be in parentheses after the [move] tag without any markdown. So the format should be [move] (Explanation) paper. Alright, that makes sense. Let me structure it correctly this time.\n",

      "thinking_text": null,
      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the first round I played paper because I thought the new player would choose rock. But it turned out they also chose paper, leading to a tie. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nNew players often start with rock, but maybe this one didn't. Since the first move was paper, maybe they'll switch. If they chose paper last time, they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might go for scissors to beat paper. Alternatively, they might expect me to switch to scissors and then they'll choose rock. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's break it down.\n\nIn the first round, both chose paper. Now, what's the common pattern after a tie? Some players repeat their move, others switch. If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it. But if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might go for rock. But rock would lose to paper again. Alternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my expected scissors by choosing rock. But since they are new, maybe they just alternate randomly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: paper gives the highest reward (3 points) when it beats rock. If they noticed that, maybe they'll try to use paper again hoping I go back to rock. But since we both did paper last time, maybe they'll switch to scissors expecting me to stay on paper. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they choose scissors, and I choose rock, I get 1 point. If they choose paper again, and I choose scissors, I get 1 point. If they choose rock, and I choose paper, I get 3 points. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to vary their move. Since the first move was paper, they might switch to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper if they repeat, but lose to rock. If I choose rock, I lose to paper but beat scissors. If I choose paper again, maybe they expect that and choose scissors. \n\nWait, but since they are a new player, maybe they don't have a strategy yet. They might just pick randomly. But after a tie with paper, they might think to switch. Let's see: possible moves for them are rock, paper, scissors. If they switch, maybe they go to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper (if they repeat) or lose to rock. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors (if they switch to scissors) but lose to paper. If I choose paper again, I tie if they repeat, lose to scissors, or beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to counter their possible reaction. Since we both did paper, they might think I'll switch. If they switch to scissors, expecting me to stay on paper, then I should choose rock. If they switch to rock, expecting me to switch to scissors, then I should choose paper again. But this is getting too into their head. Maybe a safer bet is to go with scissors, which beats paper if they repeat, and if they switch to rock, I lose but that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe rock is better because if they switch to scissors, I win. But how likely is that?\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs again. Paper gives the highest reward, so maybe they'll try to use it again. But since it tied, maybe they avoid it. Or maybe they stick with it. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the best move is to go with scissors, expecting them to repeat paper. If they do, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I choose rock, I can beat scissors if they switch to that. But if they stay on paper, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best strategy is to cycle. Since I played paper last time, maybe play scissors next. That way, if they expect me to cycle, they might play rock, but that's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe stick with paper again. But that's risky if they switch to scissors. \n\nWait, but new players might not think that deeply. After a tie with paper, they might just try a different move randomly. So maybe the probability is spread out. But without knowing their pattern, it's hard. Maybe the safest is to choose scissors, hoping they repeat paper. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. But given that paper gives higher points, maybe they stick with it. Hmm. I think I'll go with scissors this time.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The first two rounds both ended in ties because we both chose the same move. First, I picked paper, and the opponent also picked paper. Then I switched to scissors, thinking they might repeat paper, but they also chose scissors. Hmm, so maybe the opponent is mirroring my moves? Or perhaps they're trying to predict my strategy.\n\nSince the first time I chose paper, they did too. Then when I switched to scissors, they did the same. Maybe they're following a pattern where they copy my previous move. If that's the case, then in the next round, they might expect me to choose scissors again, so they might go for rock to beat scissors. If I think they'll pick rock, then I should choose paper to beat rock and get the maximum 3 points. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating their moves. But since both times they matched me, maybe they're sticking with the same strategy. Let me test this. If I choose rock next, they might also choose rock again, leading to another tie. But if they're expecting me to switch to rock after two papers and scissors, they might choose paper. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAnother angle: since the opponent is a new player, maybe they're using a simple strategy like always picking the same move. But in the first round, they picked paper, then scissors. So they changed. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, after I chose paper, they thought I might choose scissors next, so they picked scissors to beat paper. But when I did pick scissors, they also picked scissors. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotate strategy: rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc. But since they went paper then scissors, maybe next they'll go rock. If that's the case, I should pick paper again. But if they're rotating, then after scissors comes rock. So paper would beat rock. \n\nWait, but the first two rounds were both ties. Maybe the opponent is trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. Since I went paper then scissors, maybe they think I'll go rock next (following the pattern paper -> scissors -> rock). If they expect rock, they might choose paper to beat it. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But this is getting too speculative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is randomizing. But since they're a new player, they might not be using a complex strategy. Maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's see: first paper, then scissors, next could be rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, after two ties, the opponent might try to break the pattern by changing their move. If they think I'll stick with scissors again, they might choose rock. So I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nBut I need to consider the payoffs. Paper gives 3 points if it beats rock, which is the highest reward. So if I can predict they'll choose rock, paper is the best move. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to switch to rock, expecting them to choose scissors (if they think I'll stick with scissors again). But if they choose scissors, rock would beat it for 1 point. Alternatively, if they choose paper again, rock would lose. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with rock this time to break the cycle. But given the previous two ties, perhaps the opponent is also trying to predict my next move. If I went paper, scissors, maybe they expect me to go rock next. So they might choose paper to beat rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nWait, that's a possibility. If I choose scissors, and they choose paper, I get 1 point. But if they choose rock, scissors would lose. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a counter-strategy. Since I chose scissors last time, they might expect me to choose rock next, so they pick paper. Then I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without more data, it's hard to tell. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to play scissors, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, stick with paper again, hoping they go back to rock. \n\nWait, the first time I chose paper, they also chose paper. Then I chose scissors, they chose scissors. If I choose rock now, maybe they'll choose rock again, leading to another tie. But if they're following my previous move, then after scissors, they might expect rock. So they might choose paper to beat rock. In that case, I should choose scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the opponent is just mirroring my previous move. So if I chose scissors last time, they'll choose scissors again. But in the second round, I chose scissors and they did too. If I choose scissors again, they might do the same. But that's three ties in a row. Maybe they'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is new, they might not have a set strategy. Maybe they're just randomly picking. But given the first two moves matched mine, perhaps they're copying. If that's the case, then whatever I choose next, they'll choose the same. So to break the tie, I need to choose a move that beats my previous move. \n\nWait, if they're copying my previous move, then my last move was scissors. So they'll choose scissors again. To beat scissors, I should choose rock. But if they're copying, they'll choose scissors, so rock would win. \n\nBut in the second round, I chose scissors and they chose scissors. If I now choose rock, and they copy my previous move (scissors), then rock beats scissors. That would give me 1 point. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. Then I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the safest move is to switch to rock, hoping they copy scissors again. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, try paper again, but that led to a tie first time. \n\nHmm. Let's go with rock. If they copy scissors again, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given the previous two rounds, they might expect me to switch, so they might choose paper. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotate strategy. After two scissors, they might go to rock. Then I should choose paper. \n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should go with paper again. If they think I'll switch, they might choose rock, and paper beats rock. But if they stick with scissors, paper loses. \n\nWait, in the first round, paper vs paper. Second round, scissors vs scissors. If I choose rock, maybe they choose rock again. But if they're rotating, maybe they go to rock. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent is new, they might not have a pattern. Maybe they just pick randomly. But given the first two rounds, they mirrored my moves. So perhaps they'll do that again. \n\nIf I choose rock, they choose rock. Tie. If I choose paper, they choose paper. Tie. If I choose scissors, they choose scissors. Tie. But that can't be, because the game would never end. So maybe they'll change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after two ties, they'll try to break it by choosing a different move. For example, if I choose rock, they might choose paper. \n\nBut without knowing their strategy, it's hard. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to play scissors again. But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, since paper gives the highest reward (3 points) if it beats rock, maybe I should choose paper, hoping they choose rock. But why would they choose rock? If they think I'll switch to rock after two ties, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is really a game of psychology. As a new player, maybe they're sticking to the same move. But they changed from paper to scissors. So maybe they're rotating. Next would be rock. So I should choose paper. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If they rotated from paper to scissors, next is rock. So paper beats rock. Let's go with paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move to make next. Let's recap the previous rounds to spot any patterns.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, opponent also chose paper. Tie. So new players might start with rock, but in this case, they went paper. Maybe they thought the same as me.\n\nSecond round: I switched to scissors, expecting them to repeat paper. But they also chose scissors. Another tie. Hmm, maybe they're mirroring my moves or trying to predict my strategy.\n\nThird round: I went with paper again, thinking they might switch to rock after two ties. But they picked scissors, which beats paper. So I lost that round. Now they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might go for scissors once more to counter paper, or maybe switch to rock expecting me to switch to scissors.\n\nWait, the opponent's pattern so far: paper, scissors, scissors. Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous moves. Let's see:\n\nRound 1: Me - paper, Opponent - paper (tie)\nRound 2: Me - scissors, Opponent - scissors (tie)\nRound 3: Me - paper, Opponent - scissors (they won)\n\nSo after two ties, they went scissors and won. Now, what's their next move? If they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll expect me to go rock to beat their scissors. But if I do that, and they stick with scissors, I win. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper again, they might go scissors again. But since they just won with scissors, maybe they'll repeat it. Or maybe they'll switch to rock expecting me to choose scissors to beat their scissors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of their own. Let's think about common strategies. Some players rotate through moves in a cycle. If they did paper, scissors, scissors, maybe next they'll go rock? Or maybe they're trying to counter my moves. Since I chose paper last time and lost, they might expect me to switch to rock or scissors. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, I lose. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If I choose paper again, and they choose scissors again, I lose. So maybe I need to break the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But how to predict?\n\nAnother angle: the payoffs. When they beat me with scissors, they got +1, and I got -1. Since the reward for scissors beating paper is only +1, maybe they prefer higher rewards. The highest reward is when paper beats rock (3 points). So maybe they'll try to go for that. If they think I might switch to rock to counter their scissors, they might choose paper to get the higher reward. But that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter-strategy. Since I've chosen paper twice and scissors once, they might expect me to cycle through. If I went paper, scissors, paper, maybe next I'll go scissors again. So they might choose rock to beat scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to go with rock. If they expect me to avoid paper (since I lost with it last time), they might choose scissors again. Then rock would beat scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose rock, they might go paper. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. So I should choose paper again. But that's what I did last time and lost. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the possible moves and outcomes:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- They choose scissors: I win (+1)\n- They choose rock: tie\n- They choose paper: I lose (-3)\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- They choose scissors: I lose (-1)\n- They choose paper: tie\n- They choose rock: I win (+3)\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- They choose rock: I lose (-1)\n- They choose scissors: tie\n- They choose paper: I win (+1)\n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose big. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might go paper. But that's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating their moves. Their moves so far: paper, scissors, scissors. Not a clear pattern. Maybe they're trying to confuse me. If they used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But to what? If they go back to paper, then scissors would win. If they go to rock, paper would win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they repeat the move that just won. Since they won with scissors last time, they might use it again. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But if they do switch, I lose. But given the uncertainty, maybe rock is the safer choice, considering the possible gain and the risk. Let's see:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If they choose scissors: +1\n- If they choose paper: -3\n- If they choose rock: 0\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If they choose scissors: -1\n- If they choose paper: 0\n- If they choose rock: +3\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If they choose rock: -1\n- If they choose scissors: 0\n- If they choose paper: +1\n\nThe highest reward is paper beating rock (+3), but the risk is -1 if they choose scissors again. The safest might be scissors, which only risks -1 if they choose rock, but if they choose paper again, I get +1. Wait, but they just beat my paper with scissors. If they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper to get the high reward. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to rock, so they'll choose paper. Then I should choose scissors to beat their paper. But if they choose scissors again, it's a tie. If they choose rock, I lose. But the potential gain is +1 if they choose paper, which they might if they're going for the high reward.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. Their moves: paper, scissors, scissors. Maybe they're sticking with scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they switch, I lose. Alternatively, if they're alternating, but not sure. Maybe the safest is to choose rock, hoping they stick with scissors. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. Then I should choose scissors. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since they've beaten me with scissors, maybe they'll try to use it again. So I should choose rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. But maybe the risk is worth it. Alternatively, since they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But to what? If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should cycle through moves. I've done paper, scissors, paper. Next could be scissors again. But that might be predictable. Alternatively, go rock to break the cycle.\n\nAlternatively, consider the payoffs. The highest reward is paper beating rock (+3). Maybe the opponent is trying to get that. If they think I'll choose rock, they'll choose paper. But I can counter by choosing scissors to beat their paper. Wait, scissors beats paper. So if I choose scissors and they choose paper, I get +1. But if they choose rock, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll go for rock next. So I should choose paper. But that's a guess.\n\nThis is getting too uncertain. Maybe the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to choose, perhaps go with rock to counter their possible scissors again. If they do scissors, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. But maybe not. It's a gamble. Alternatively, choose scissors to beat their possible paper if they expect me to go rock. But this is too much second-guessing.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two times they chose scissors, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to paper, I choose scissors. But I can't do both. Maybe choose paper to cover the possibility they switch to rock. But if they choose scissors again, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about what a new player might do. After winning with scissors, they might stick with it, thinking it's lucky. So I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might switch. It's a mind game. \n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is to choose rock, hoping they stick with scissors. If they do, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given the previous pattern, they might stick with scissors. So I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing scissors a lot, so I went with rock twice and won. Then I tried rock again, but they switched to paper, which beat me. Now I need to figure out their next move.\n\nHmm, after losing with rock to their paper, maybe they think I'll switch. If they used paper last time and won, they might expect me to go for scissors to beat paper. But if I go scissors, and they stick with paper, I win. But wait, they might anticipate that and switch to rock to beat my scissors. Or maybe they'll stay with paper again, thinking I might not expect a repeat. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they could go back to rock to counter scissors. That would mean I should choose paper to beat their rock. But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the pattern again:\n\n1. Round 1: Both paper \u2013 tie.\n2. Round 2: Both scissors \u2013 tie.\n3. Round 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors \u2013 I lost.\n4. Round 4: I chose rock, they chose scissors \u2013 I won.\n5. Round 5: Both scissors \u2013 tie.\n6. Round 6: I chose rock, they scissors \u2013 I won.\n7. Round 7: I chose rock, they paper \u2013 I lost.\n\nSo their moves so far: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper. Wait, no, let me recount based on results:\n\n- First round: both paper.\n- Second round: both scissors.\n- Third round: they chose scissors (I had paper, they won with scissors).\n- Fourth round: they chose scissors (I chose rock, won).\n- Fifth round: both scissors.\n- Sixth round: they chose scissors (I chose rock, won again).\n- Seventh round: they chose paper (I chose rock, lost).\n\nSo their moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper. So they used paper twice and scissors five times. The last two moves were scissors then paper. After I kept using rock, they switched to paper. Now, after they won with paper, what's next?\n\nIf they just switched to paper and won, maybe they'll stick with paper again, expecting me to switch to scissors. But if I choose scissors, I can beat paper. However, they might predict that and switch to rock. Alternatively, they might think I'll go back to paper to counter their expected rock. This is a bit of a mind game. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. But their pattern isn't clear. Since they just used paper, maybe they'll go back to scissors, thinking I'll switch to something else. If I choose rock again, I can beat scissors. But they might expect that and stay with paper. \n\nWait, the last time they used paper, I lost. So they might think I'll avoid rock now. If I choose paper, and they choose paper, it's a tie. If they choose scissors, I lose. If they choose rock, I win. But given their recent switch to paper, maybe they'll try to counter my expected move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern where after winning with paper, they switch back to scissors. If that's the case, rock would win again. But this is uncertain. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the safest move is to go with paper. If they expect me to switch from rock to something else, maybe they'll choose rock, which paper beats. Or if they stick with paper, it's a tie. If they go scissors, I lose. But considering their recent switch to paper, maybe they'll stick with it, leading to a tie. Alternatively, they might switch back to scissors, so rock would be better. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their responses. They used scissors a lot, then switched to paper once. If they alternate, next could be rock. But there's no prior instance of them using rock. Alternatively, they might stick with paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper and won, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll choose rock. In that case, I should choose paper to beat rock. \n\nAlternatively, they might repeat paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper, but if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to vary my move. Since I've been using rock and paper, maybe switch to scissors. But given the last loss with rock, perhaps they expect me to avoid rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they just used paper, which beats rock, they might expect me to switch to scissors. If they choose rock to beat my scissors, then I should choose paper. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nMaybe the best move is to choose paper. If they stick with paper, it's a tie. If they switch to rock, I win. If they choose scissors, I lose. But considering their recent move to paper, maybe they'll stick with it. Alternatively, they might switch back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used paper once, maybe they'll go back to scissors. In that case, rock would win. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given the uncertainty, perhaps choosing paper is a balanced approach. If they expect me to avoid rock, they might go for rock, which paper beats. Alternatively, if they stay with paper, it's a tie. If they go scissors, I lose. But given their history, they might switch back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous rock with paper again. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But they might expect that and choose rock. \n\nThis is really a game of predicting the opponent's prediction. Since they just beat my rock with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors. To counter that, they might choose rock. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the move would be paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been switching their moves based on my previous choices. In the last round, I chose paper, and they also chose paper, leading to a tie. Now, I need to figure out what they might do next.\n\nLooking back, after I won with rock twice, they switched to paper to beat my rock. Then when I tried paper again, they tied. Maybe they're trying to predict my moves. If I just tied with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors next to beat paper. So if they expect scissors, they might choose rock to counter. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But wait, they might also think that I think they'll switch to rock, so they might stay with paper again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, considering the pattern: they used scissors a few times, then paper, then scissors again. It's a bit random. Maybe they're alternating between moves. Last time they did paper, then scissors, then paper again. Wait, no, the last moves were: when I chose rock, they chose scissors (I won), then I chose scissors, they chose scissors (tie), then I chose rock again, they chose paper (they won), then I chose paper, they chose paper (tie). So their moves were scissors, scissors, paper, paper. Hmm, they repeated scissors twice, then paper twice. If they continue the pattern, maybe they'll switch to rock next. If they choose rock, I should pick paper. But if they think I expect them to switch to rock, they might stay with paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with the same move after a tie. The last two ties were scissors and paper. After the scissors tie, they went to paper. After the paper tie, maybe they'll switch again. If they switch from paper, they might go to scissors. If they choose scissors, I should pick rock. Wait, but in the last round when I chose paper and they tied, maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors, so they might go rock to beat scissors. Then I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves so far:\n\nRound 1: Opponent chose paper (tie)\nRound 2: Opponent chose scissors (tie)\nRound 3: Opponent chose scissors (I lost with paper)\nRound 4: Opponent chose scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 5: Opponent chose scissors (tie)\nRound 6: Opponent chose scissors (I won with rock)\nRound 7: Opponent chose paper (I lost with rock)\nRound 8: Opponent chose paper (tie)\n\nWait, no, let me recount based on the history provided:\n\n1. First round: both paper (tie)\n2. Second round: both scissors (tie)\n3. Third round: opponent scissors, I paper (I lost)\n4. Fourth round: opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\n5. Fifth round: both scissors (tie)\n6. Sixth round: opponent scissors, I rock (I won)\n7. Seventh round: opponent paper, I rock (I lost)\n8. Eighth round: both paper (tie)\n\nSo opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me check the user's previous interactions:\n\nLooking at the history:\n\n- First move: user chose paper, opponent paper (tie)\n- Second move: user scissors, opponent scissors (tie)\n- Third move: user paper, opponent scissors (user lost)\n- Fourth move: user rock, opponent scissors (user won)\n- Fifth move: user scissors, opponent scissors (tie)\n- Sixth move: user rock, opponent scissors (user won)\n- Seventh move: user rock, opponent paper (user lost)\n- Eighth move: user paper, opponent paper (tie)\n\nSo opponent's moves in order: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper.\n\nWait, the eighth round was both paper, so opponent's eighth move was paper. So the opponent's moves are: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper. That's a pattern of switching from paper to scissors, then sticking with scissors for a few rounds, then switching back to paper and repeating. Now, after the last tie with paper, they might either stick with paper again or switch. If they've been sticking with the same move after a tie, like after the first tie (both paper), they chose scissors next. Wait, no: after the first tie (both paper), the next move they chose scissors. Then after the scissors tie, they chose scissors again. Then after the scissors tie again, they chose paper. Hmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to my moves. For example, when I chose rock twice and won, they switched to paper. Then when I chose paper, they tied. Now, after the tie with paper, if I choose scissors, they might expect that and choose rock. But if I choose rock, they might expect me to go back to rock and choose paper again. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they choose rock, so I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: paper gives the highest reward (3 points) when it beats rock. Since the opponent might be trying to maximize their own points, maybe they prefer using paper to get higher points. But in the last few rounds, they used paper twice. If they continue with paper, I should choose scissors to beat it. But in the last round, we both chose paper, so they might switch to scissors to beat my potential paper. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to look for the opponent's tendencies. They used paper three times, scissors four times, and rock never. So they haven't chosen rock yet. Maybe they avoid rock. If that's the case, they might choose between paper and scissors. If they tend to choose paper after a tie, then I should choose scissors. But in the last round, after a tie with paper, they might switch to scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But since they haven't used rock before, maybe they'll stick with paper or scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper recently (last three moves: paper, paper, paper), maybe they're sticking with paper. If they choose paper again, I should choose scissors. But in the last round, we both chose paper, so they might expect me to switch to scissors and counter with rock. But they haven't used rock before. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of repeating the same move after a tie. So after the tie with paper, they might choose paper again. If that's the case, I should choose scissors. But if they break the pattern and switch, then scissors would lose to rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. But given that they've been using paper three times in a row, they might switch. Alternatively, since they haven't used rock, maybe they'll try rock now. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent might be trying to counter my previous move. My last move was paper. If they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock. But again, they haven't used rock before. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper three times, maybe they'll switch to something else. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, maybe it's better to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Wait, but they haven't used scissors in the last three moves. The last three were paper, paper, paper. So maybe they're sticking with paper. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper, and I just tied with paper, maybe they'll think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll choose rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nBut since they haven't used rock yet, maybe they won't start now. It's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll continue with paper, so scissors is the safe choice. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, perhaps scissors is the best choice, expecting them to stay with paper. But if they do switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, choosing paper again might lead to another tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they used paper three times, they might expect me to counter with scissors, so they switch to rock. Therefore, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nBut this is all speculative. Given the opponent's history of not using rock, maybe they'll stick with paper or scissors. If they choose scissors, I need rock. If they choose paper, I need scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a random choice is better, but since the opponent seems to be sticking with paper recently, scissors might be the way to go. \n\nI think I'll go with scissors, expecting them to stay with paper.\n",

Wait, in round 9, opponent used paper again. So they used paper three times in a row (rounds 7,8,9). Then in round 9, I used scissors and won. Now, if they were using paper three times, maybe they'll switch. If they lost with paper in round 9, they might switch to rock to beat scissors. So if I expect them to switch to rock, I should choose paper. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might stay with paper again. Alternatively, they might go scissors to beat paper. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are sticking to a pattern. They used paper three times. If they continue, I can beat them with scissors again. But after losing with paper, they might change. It's a bit of a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll go back to rock. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. But if they choose scissors, paper loses. Wait, no: scissors beats paper. So if I choose paper and they choose scissors, I lose. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock.\n\nGiven that they've been using paper a lot, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my scissors. So if I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they switch to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with paper, I can use scissors again. But they just lost with paper, so they might switch. It's a bit of a 50-50. Maybe I should go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. But that's risky. Alternatively, stick with scissors again. If they stay with paper, I win again. If they switch to rock, I lose. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they'll expect me to repeat scissors and choose rock, so I should choose paper. But that's a double bluff. This is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their paper didn't work. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they used paper three times, maybe they'll cycle back to rock. So paper would beat rock. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should go with paper again, but that's risky. Alternatively, look for a pattern in their moves. They went from scissors to paper, then stuck with paper. Maybe they're cycling through. If they were on paper, next could be scissors.

If they alternate between scissors and paper, next might be paper. But that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: when they beat me with scissors, they get +1. When they beat me with paper, they get +3. But in the last round, they used scissors to beat my paper, getting +1. Maybe they prefer higher points, so they might switch to paper to get more points. But that's not certain. \n\nAlternatively, since I just lost with paper, maybe I should switch to a different move. If I choose rock, and they choose scissors again, I win. If they choose paper, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors because it's working. So I should counter with rock. But they might anticipate that. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. The opponent's moves: \n\nLooking back:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: scissors (tie)\nRound 3: scissors (they won)\nRound 4: scissors (they lost)\nRound 5: scissors (tie)\nRound 6: scissors (they lost)\nRound 7: paper (they won)\nRound 8: paper (tie)\nRound 9: paper (they lost)\nRound 10: paper (tie)\nRound 11: scissors (they won)\n\nSo opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors. \n\nWait, that's not exactly. Let me list each round's opponent move based on the results:\n\n1. Both paper (tie) \u2192 opponent: paper\n2. Both scissors (tie) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n3. I paper, they scissors (I lost) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n4. I rock, they scissors (I won) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n5. Both scissors (tie) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n6. I rock, they scissors (I won) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n7. I rock, they paper (I lost) \u2192 opponent: paper\n8. Both paper (tie) \u2192 opponent: paper\n9. I scissors, they paper (I won) \u2192 opponent: paper\n10. Both paper (tie) \u2192 opponent: paper\n11. I paper, they scissors (I lost) \u2192 opponent: scissors\n\nSo opponent's moves in order: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors.\n\nSo the opponent's pattern: after several scissors, they switched to paper for a few rounds, then back to scissors. Now, in the last round, they used scissors again. \n\nSo maybe they're cycling between scissors and paper. But the last two times they used scissors, then paper, then scissors again. Wait, no: after round 7 (paper), then 8 (paper), 9 (paper), 10 (paper), 11 (scissors). So they used paper four times in a row, then switched to scissors. \n\nSo perhaps they're changing their move after a loss. Let's see:\n\nAfter round 9: I won with scissors against their paper. So they lost, then in round 10, they used paper again (tie). Then in round 11, they switched to scissors and won. \n\nSo maybe after a loss, they switch. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. When I played paper three times (rounds 8,10,11), they used paper, paper, scissors. So when I played paper in round 11, they switched to scissors. \n\nNow, in the next round, if I play rock, they might expect that since I lost with paper, I switch to rock. So they might play paper to counter. If I play scissors, they might expect me to stick with paper again, but I just lost, so maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, if they used scissors in the last round and won, they might stick with scissors again. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they'll play paper. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll repeat their winning move. They just won with scissors, so they might play scissors again. Therefore, I should play rock. But if they anticipate that, they'll play paper. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been switching between paper and scissors, maybe they'll switch back to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they play rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a counter to my previous move. My last move was paper, which they beat with scissors. Now, if I switch to rock, they might expect that and play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe the safest move is to go with rock, expecting them to repeat scissors. But given that they just used scissors and won, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they switch to paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their paper. \n\nWait, but if they think I'm switching to rock, they play paper. Then I play scissors to beat their paper. That would work. \n\nAlternatively, if they stick with scissors, I should play rock. But if they switch to paper, I lose. \n\nThis is a gamble. Based on their recent switch from paper to scissors in round 11, maybe they're now sticking with scissors. So rock would be good. But they might anticipate that. \n\nAlternatively, since they've used scissors twice in the last three rounds (rounds 11 and 3,4,5,6), maybe they favor scissors. So rock is a good choice. \n\nBut given that they just used scissors to beat my paper, and I might switch to rock, they might switch to paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nHmm. I'm torn between rock and scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a random choice is better, but since we need to strategize, perhaps the best is to go with scissors, expecting them to switch to paper. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think again. \n\nIn the last round, I played paper, they played scissors. Now, if I play rock, and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper, I lose. If they play rock, tie. \n\nIf I play scissors, and they play scissors, tie. If they play paper, I win. If they play rock, I lose. \n\nIf I play paper, and they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, I win. If they play paper, tie. \n\nSo, considering their possible moves:\n\nIf they repeat scissors (same as last time), then rock beats scissors. \n\nIf they expect me to play rock, they play paper. Then scissors beats paper. \n\nIf they expect me to play scissors, they play rock. Then paper beats rock. \n\nThis is a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma. \n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, maybe they'll stick with it. So rock is the play. But if they adapt, they might switch. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been alternating between paper and scissors, maybe they'll go back to paper. \n\nAlternatively, given that they used scissors in the last round, and before that, four papers, maybe they're now on a scissors streak. \n\nI think the best bet is to play rock, hoping they repeat scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play scissors to counter a possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, look for a pattern in their moves. They used scissors, then paper, then scissors. Maybe they're alternating. If that's the case, next would be paper. So scissors would beat paper. \n\nBut that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, since they used scissors after four papers, maybe they're now on a scissors trend. So rock. \n\nI think I'll go with rock.\n",

In the last few rounds, they used scissors and lost to my rock, then switched to paper which tied, then scissors again which I beat with rock. But then they went back to scissors again and I won with rock. Wait, no, the last move they made was scissors when I chose rock, so they lost. Then in the next round, when I chose paper, they used scissors again and beat me. Hmm.\n\nSo the pattern seems like they might be sticking with scissors, but sometimes they switch. After I used rock and won, they might expect me to use rock again, so they could switch to paper. But in the last round, I used rock again and they stuck with scissors. Now, if I choose rock again, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter. But if they think I'll switch from rock to something else, they might stay with scissors. This is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. Let me check the history:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: I chose paper, they chose scissors (I lost)\n- Round 4: I chose rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Round 5: I chose scissors, they scissors (tie)\n- Round 6: I chose rock, they scissors (I won)\n- Round 7: I chose rock, they paper (I lost)\n- Round 8: I chose paper, they paper (tie)\n- Round 9: I chose scissors, they paper (I won)\n- Round 10: I chose paper, they paper (tie)\n- Round 11: I chose paper, they scissors (I lost)\n- Round 12: I chose rock, they scissors (I won)\n\nSo looking at their moves: scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, no, let me list their moves based on the results:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie)\n2. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n3. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n4.

Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n\nSo their moves are: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, scissors. Hmm, they seem to have a pattern of sticking with a move for a few rounds. They used scissors multiple times, then switched to paper for a few rounds, then back to scissors. The last two moves were scissors. Maybe they're sticking with scissors again. If that's the case, rock would be the best choice. But after I used rock twice and they lost, they might switch to paper. So maybe I should counter that by choosing scissors to beat paper. Wait, no, scissors beats paper, but if they choose paper, scissors would win. But if they expect me to switch from rock to something else, maybe they'll stay with scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to paper to beat their expected rock, but I just used rock and won, so they might not expect me to switch. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should vary my move. If they've been using scissors a lot, rock is good, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to rock expecting my scissors. Wait, no, in the last round, I used rock and they used scissors. If they think I'll use rock again, they might go paper. So to counter that, I should choose scissors. But scissors loses to rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from rock to paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper. So maybe I should choose rock again. It's a bit of a guessing game. Alternatively, maybe they're using a pattern of scissors, scissors, scissors, so next would be scissors again. Then rock would win. But after two losses with scissors, they might switch. Hmm. I think the safest bet is to go with rock again, hoping they stick with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch, so I should choose something else. This is tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern in their switches. They used scissors four times in a row, then paper four times, then scissors again. If that's a pattern, maybe they'll switch back to paper. But the last two were scissors. Maybe they're alternating between scissors and paper. But the last two were scissors. If they continue with scissors, rock is good. If they switch to paper, I need scissors. But I can't be sure. Maybe I should go with paper, which beats rock, in case they switch to rock expecting my rock again. Wait, but if they choose paper, then it's a tie. If they choose scissors, paper loses. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're random. In that case, the best strategy is to play unpredictably. But given the history, they seem to have streaks. So if they were on a scissors streak, maybe they'll continue. So rock is the move. But after two losses with scissors, they might switch. I think I'll go with rock again, hoping they continue with scissors. If they switch to paper, I lose, but if they stay with scissors, I win. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch, so I should choose paper. But I'm not sure. Let's take the risk and stick with rock once more.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using scissors a lot, especially in the last few rounds. When I played rock, I won because they had scissors. Then I played rock again, and they switched to paper, which made me lose. After that, I tried paper, but they tied with me. Then scissors again, which worked once, but then they went back to scissors when I played rock again.\n\nHmm, so the pattern seems a bit inconsistent. They might be trying to predict my moves based on my previous choices. Let's recap the recent moves:\n\n- I played rock three times, winning twice when they had scissors, but lost once when they switched to paper.\n- When I tried paper, they either tied (paper) or beat me with scissors.\n- Scissors worked once when they had paper, but then tied when they also chose scissors.\n\nThe opponent might be alternating between scissors and paper, but it's hard to tell. Since they used scissors the last two times I played rock and won, maybe they expect me to keep playing rock. If they think I'll stick with rock, they might switch to paper again to beat me. But if I switch to scissors, I can beat paper. Wait, but scissors loses to rock. Let me check the rules again:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (1 point)\n- Paper beats rock (3 points)\n- Scissors beats paper (1 point)\n\nSo if they think I'm going to play rock again, they might choose paper. To counter that, I should play scissors. But if they instead stick with scissors, then I should play rock. But how to decide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to vary their moves to avoid a pattern. Since they've used scissors multiple times, maybe they'll switch to rock to counter my scissors. But I haven't played scissors much recently. Wait, the last time I played scissors, they also played scissors, resulting in a tie. Then I switched back to rock and won.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's think about possible strategies. If the opponent is trying to counter my rock, they might go for paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they instead go back to scissors, then scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if they expect me to switch from rock to something else, maybe they'll stay with scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a rotation: after scissors, they go to paper, then rock, etc. But I don't see a clear rotation pattern. Let's look at their recent moves based on my moves:\n\nMy last moves: rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock.\n\nOpponent's responses: scissors (win for me), paper (loss), paper (tie), scissors (win), paper (loss), scissors (loss), paper (win), scissors (tie), scissors (win), paper (loss), scissors (win).\n\nWait, the opponent's moves seem to be scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. It's a bit all over the place. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors. When I played scissors, they played scissors. When I played rock, they sometimes played scissors or paper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to beat my last move. For instance, if I played rock last time, they play paper next. But when I played rock twice in a row, they first played scissors, then paper. So that doesn't fit. Maybe they're not following a strict pattern.\n\nGiven that the last two times I played rock, they played scissors (win for me) and then paper (loss). Then when I played paper, they played scissors (loss for me). Then scissors, they played scissors (tie). Then rock again, they played scissors (win). So perhaps they are favoring scissors, but occasionally switching to paper to counter my rock.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe they'll continue with scissors, so I should play rock again. But the last time I played rock, they played scissors, so if they think I'll repeat rock, they might switch to paper. But if I play scissors, I can beat paper. However, if they stick with scissors, scissors vs scissors is a tie. Alternatively, if I play paper, paper beats rock, but if they play scissors, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the points: paper gives 3 points if it beats rock, which is a higher reward. But the opponent might be aware of that and try to use paper when they expect rock. But since I've been using rock a lot, maybe they'll expect it and go for paper. So to counter that, I should play scissors. But if they instead play scissors, then it's a tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a mixed strategy, making it harder to predict. In that case, perhaps I should vary my own moves. But given the recent history, they have used scissors more often. Let's count how many times they've played each move:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOpponent's moves: scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors.\n\nScissors: 6 times\n\nPaper: 5 times\n\nRock: 0 times\n\nSo they haven't played rock at all. Interesting. So they might be avoiding rock entirely. If that's the case, then their moves are only scissors and paper. So if I play rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper but tie with scissors. If I play paper, I can beat rock (which they don't use) but lose to scissors.\n\nWait, but they don't use rock. So their moves are only scissors and paper. So the possible outcomes:\n\nIf I play rock: beats scissors (1 point), loses to paper (-3 points)\n\nIf I play paper: beats rock (but they don't use it, so no), loses to scissors (-1 point), ties with paper (0)\n\nIf I play scissors: beats paper (1 point), ties with scissors (0)\n\nSo given that they only use scissors and paper, the best strategy would be to play scissors, which can either beat their paper or tie with their scissors. Alternatively, play rock to beat their scissors but risk losing to their paper. Since they have used scissors more often (6 times) than paper (5 times), maybe playing rock is better, as there's a slightly higher chance they'll choose scissors. But the risk is that if they choose paper, I lose 3 points. Alternatively, playing scissors gives a safer option with possible 1 point or 0.\n\nBut considering the point values, losing 3 points is worse than gaining 1. So maybe it's better to play scissors to minimize risk. However, if they are more likely to play scissors, then rock would be better. But they have used scissors 6 times and paper 5 times, which is almost equal. So it's a close call.\n\nAlternatively, since in the last few rounds, their moves have been alternating between scissors and paper. Let's check the last five moves:\n\nOpponent's last five moves: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors.\n\nWait, the last few after the recent rounds:\n\nAfter the last few rounds, the opponent's moves were: scissors (win for me when I played rock), paper (loss when I played paper), scissors (tie when I played scissors), scissors (win when I played rock), paper (loss when I played paper), scissors (win when I played rock).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors. It's alternating between scissors and paper but with some repeats. The last move was scissors. If they alternate, the next would be paper. But they might repeat scissors again. Hmm.\n\nIf the last move was scissors, and they alternate, next would be paper. So if I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they repeat scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if I play rock, and they play paper, I lose. If they play scissors, I win. So it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, since they used scissors last time, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll expect them to switch to paper, they might stay with scissors to counter my scissors. But that's getting too meta.\n\nAlternatively, considering that they have not used rock at all, maybe they have a bias against it. So they might continue with scissors and paper. Given that, perhaps the best move is to play scissors, which can either tie or win, minimizing losses. But given the recent pattern, maybe they'll play paper next. So scissors would be good. Alternatively, if they play scissors again, then rock would be better. But since they just played scissors, maybe they'll switch.\n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. But given that they have used scissors more often, and the last move was scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. So I'll go with scissors to beat paper. If they repeat scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, I win. Alternatively, if I play rock and they play paper, I lose big. So maybe scissors is safer.\n",

If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nWait, in the last round, after a tie with paper, I chose paper again, and they also chose paper. So maybe they're sticking with the same move after a tie. If that's the case, they might choose paper again. Then I should choose scissors. But if they think I'll do that, they might switch to rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should go with a balanced approach. Since they've used paper the last two times, maybe they'll switch. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper but lose to rock. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a move that hasn't been used as much recently. Let's see: their recent moves were scissors, paper, scissors, paper. So alternating between scissors and paper. If that's the case, next might be scissors again. Then I should choose rock. But in the last round, they used paper, so next would be scissors. Wait, their pattern was scissors, paper, scissors, paper. So next would be scissors. Then rock would win. \n\nBut if they break the pattern, maybe they go to rock. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been alternating between scissors and paper, maybe they'll switch to rock to break the cycle. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. \n\nBut there's no sure way to know. Maybe I should go with the move that covers the most possibilities. If they've been alternating scissors and paper, and the last was paper, next could be scissors. So rock would beat scissors. But if they switch to rock, paper would beat it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose scissors, which beats paper (if they repeat) and ties with scissors. But if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous moves, maybe they're more likely to choose scissors again. So rock would be safe. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper, which beats rock and ties with paper. If they choose scissors, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using paper and scissors, maybe they avoid rock. So choosing scissors could be good against paper, but risky if they choose rock. \n\nThis is a lot of uncertainty. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to follow the scissors-paper alternation and pick scissors next. \n\nWait, their last move was paper. If they were alternating, next would be scissors. So rock beats scissors. But if they break the pattern, maybe they choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, after two papers, they might switch to something else. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with rock, anticipating they might choose scissors again based on the previous alternation. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if they think I'll expect scissors and choose rock, they might choose paper. \n\nThis is a game of prediction. Maybe I should randomize, but since I need to make a decision, I'll go with rock, hoping they continue the scissors-paper-scissors-paper pattern and pick scissors next.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The user is playing a rock-paper-scissors game against an opponent. The goal is to maximize points by predicting the opponent's moves. Let's look at the history of moves and outcomes to find a pattern.\n\nIn the previous rounds, the opponent's moves have been somewhat alternating. After a tie with paper, the user chose scissors, which also tied. Then they tried paper again but lost to scissors. After that, switching to rock won against scissors. Then another rock won again, but then the opponent switched to paper, causing a loss. The user tried paper again, which tied, then scissors won against paper. Then paper tied again, scissors won again, and so on.\n\nThe opponent seems to switch moves after losses. For example, when the user played rock twice and won, the opponent switched to paper. After the user played scissors and won, the opponent might expect another scissors and choose rock. But the user then chose paper, which tied. \n\nThe latest moves show the opponent alternating between scissors and paper. The user just won with scissors against paper. Now, the opponent might expect the user to repeat scissors and choose rock to counter. To counter that, the user should choose paper. But wait, the user just tried paper and it tied. Alternatively, the opponent might stick with paper again, so scissors would win. But the opponent could also switch back to rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a pattern of their own. Let's list the opponent's recent moves: paper, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors. Wait, looking back:\n\n- Round 1: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 2: Opponent scissors (tie)\n- Round 3: Opponent scissors (user lost with paper)\n- Round 4: Opponent scissors (user won with rock)\n- Round 5: Opponent paper (user lost with rock)\n- Round 6: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 7: Opponent scissors (user won with scissors)\n- Round 8: Opponent paper (user won with scissors)\n- Round 9: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 10: Opponent scissors (user won with rock)\n- Round 11: Opponent paper (user won with scissors)\n- Round 12: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 13: Opponent scissors (user won with rock)\n- Round 14: Opponent paper (user won with scissors)\n- Round 15: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 16: Opponent scissors (user won with rock)\n- Round 17: Opponent paper (user won with scissors)\n- Round 18: Opponent paper (tie)\n- Round 19: Opponent scissors (user won with rock)\n- Round 20: Opponent paper (user won with scissors)\n\nWait, the opponent seems to alternate between scissors and paper, but sometimes repeats. The user's last move was scissors, which beat the opponent's paper. Now, the opponent might expect the user to play scissors again and choose rock. To counter that, the user should play paper. However, if the opponent is sticking to their pattern of alternating, after paper, they might go back to scissors. But the user just beat their paper with scissors, so maybe they switch to rock. Alternatively, they might stick with paper again. It's a bit tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to predict the user's moves. Since the user has been switching between rock, paper, and scissors based on previous outcomes, the opponent might try to anticipate that. For example, after the user won with scissors against paper, the opponent might expect the user to play scissors again and counter with rock. So the user should play paper to beat rock. But if the opponent thinks the user will switch to paper, they might play scissors. Then the user should play rock. \n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in the opponent's moves. The opponent has been choosing scissors and paper frequently, with occasional rock. The user has had success with rock against scissors and scissors against paper. Since the last move was scissors beating paper, the opponent might switch to rock. Therefore, the user should play paper to counter rock. But if the opponent instead sticks with paper, then scissors would be better. However, given the recent pattern, the opponent might switch to rock. So paper is the safe choice. Alternatively, if the opponent continues with paper, scissors would win. But considering the opponent's tendency to switch after a loss, they might go to rock. So paper seems like the move here.\n",

So the opponent chose paper twice in a row. Now, after two consecutive paper ties, what's the likelihood they'll choose paper again? Maybe they'll stick with it, leading to a third tie.

But how to predict which they'll choose. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their possible paper, so they might choose rock to beat my scissors. In that case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But if they instead choose scissors expecting me to stay on paper, then I should choose rock. It's a bit of a guessing game here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's recent behavior, after two paper ties, they might try to break the cycle by choosing scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they think I'll go rock, they might go paper. Hmm. This is a classic rock-paper-scissors mind game.\n\nAnother angle: the opponent might be trying to detect a pattern in my moves. I've been switching between rock, paper, scissors based on their previous moves. If they notice that after two papers I might switch, they could counter. But without knowing their strategy, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to choose scissors. If they stay on paper, scissors win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. But considering they've done paper twice, maybe they'll stick with it again, so scissors would be good. Alternatively, they might expect me to go scissors and counter with rock. In that case, I should go paper. But this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a strategy where after two ties, they switch to the move that would have beaten the previous one. Since the last two were paper, they might choose scissors to beat paper. If that's the case, I should choose rock. But if they think that, they might choose paper again. It's a loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the opponent is randomizing, but given the history, they might have a pattern. Since they did paper twice, maybe they'll switch. Let's assume they switch to scissors. Then rock would win. If they switch to rock, paper would win. If they stay on paper, scissors would win. Since I can't be sure, maybe I should go with scissors, which beats paper and ties with scissors. But given the risk of them choosing rock, maybe paper is safer. Wait, no. If I choose scissors, and they choose rock, I lose. If I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I lose. If I choose rock, and they choose paper, I lose. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, considering the previous move was paper, and the opponent might expect me to switch, so they might choose scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. This is a classic meta-game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is using a \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, mirroring my last move. My last move was paper, so they might choose paper again. But that led to a tie. So maybe they'll switch. But if they mirror, they'd choose paper again. But two ties in a row might make them change.\n\nAlternatively, since the last two were paper, maybe they'll go for rock to break the cycle. If they choose rock, I should choose paper. But if they choose scissors, I should choose rock. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to alternate. Since I just played paper twice, maybe switch to scissors. If they stay on paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to switch to scissors, so they choose rock, so I should choose paper. But this is getting too recursive.\n\nAlternatively, use a counter to their possible next move. If they've been choosing paper twice, maybe they'll switch to scissors. So I choose rock. If they switch to rock, I choose paper. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to choose scissors, hoping they stay on paper. But given the previous two papers, they might expect that and choose rock. Alternatively, choose paper again, but that risks another tie. Alternatively, choose rock to counter a possible scissors. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, after two ties in a row, the opponent might try to break the pattern. Let's see previous instances. After the first two ties (paper and scissors), the opponent then chose scissors, which I countered with rock. Then they chose paper, which I countered with scissors. So maybe after two paper ties, they'll switch to scissors. If that's the case, rock would win. But if they switch to rock, paper would win. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is following a pattern of their own. Let's list their moves again based on the rounds:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie)\n2. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n3. Opponent: scissors (I lost with paper)\n4. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n5. Opponent: scissors (tie)\n6. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n7. Opponent: paper (I lost with rock)\n8. Opponent: paper (tie)\n9. Opponent: scissors (I won with rock)\n10. Opponent: paper (I won with scissors)\n11. Opponent: paper (tie)\n12. Opponent: paper (tie)\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves: paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper. Wait, that's inconsistent. They seem to switch between paper and scissors, with some rock in between. But in the last three rounds, they've chosen paper three times (rounds 10, 11, 12). Wait, no, round 10: opponent paper, round 11: opponent paper, round 12: opponent paper. So three papers in a row. Wait, but according to the history provided, the last two rounds (11 and 12) were both paper ties. So the opponent chose paper in round 11, then paper again in round 12. Now, in round 13, will they choose paper again? If they do, then scissors would win. But if they switch, maybe to rock or scissors.\n\nIf they've chosen paper three times in a row, maybe they'll stick with it again, so scissors would be good. But that's risky. Alternatively, they might think, \"I've done paper three times, he'll expect me to switch, so I'll stay with paper.\" Or they might switch. It's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent is a human, after three papers, they might get bored and switch. If they switch to rock, I should choose paper. If they switch to scissors, I should choose rock. But without knowing, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, use a probabilistic approach. If the opponent has chosen paper three times, the chance they'll choose paper again is lower. So maybe they'll switch to rock or scissors. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper and tie with scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors and lose to paper. If I choose paper, I can beat rock and tie with paper. Given that, maybe scissors is a safer choice, as it either wins or ties if they stay on paper or choose scissors. But if they choose rock, I lose. But given they've been on paper, maybe scissors is worth the risk.\n",

For example:\n\n- When the user chose paper and tied, opponent also chose paper.\n- When the user chose scissors and tied, opponent chose scissors.\n- When the user chose scissors and won, opponent chose paper.\n- When the user chose rock and won, opponent chose scissors.\n- When the user chose paper and lost, opponent chose scissors.\n- When the user chose rock and lost, opponent chose paper.\n- Etc.\n\nSo, trying to track the opponent's moves:\n\n1. Opponent: paper (tie with user's paper)\n2. Opponent: scissors (tie with user's scissors)\n3. Opponent: paper (user's scissors won)\n4. Opponent: paper (user's paper tied)\n5. Opponent: scissors (user's rock won)\n6. Opponent: paper (user's scissors won)\n7. Opponent: scissors (user's paper lost)\n8. Opponent: scissors (user's rock won)\n9. Opponent: paper (user's scissors won)\n10. Opponent: paper (user's paper tied)\n11. Opponent: scissors (user's scissors tied)\n12. Opponent: scissors (user's scissors tied again)\n13. Opponent: paper (user's scissors won)\n14. Opponent: paper (user's paper tied)\n15. Opponent: scissors (user's scissors tied)\n16. Now, after the last tie with scissors, what's next?\n\nLooking for patterns. The opponent seems to alternate between paper and scissors, but sometimes repeats. For example:\n\nAfter the user chose scissors and tied (opponent scissors), the next opponent move was paper (user chose scissors and won). Then, when the user chose paper, opponent chose paper (tie). Then user chose rock, opponent scissors (win). Then user scissors, opponent paper (win). Then user paper, opponent scissors (loss). Then user rock, opponent scissors (win). Then user scissors, opponent paper (win). Then user paper, opponent paper (tie). Then user scissors, opponent scissors (tie). Then user scissors, opponent scissors (tie again). Then user scissors, opponent paper (win). Then user paper, opponent paper (tie). Then user scissors, opponent scissors (tie). Now, after the last tie with scissors, what's next?\n\nThe opponent's recent moves: scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is alternating between paper and scissors, but sometimes repeating. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is reacting to the user's previous move. For example, if the user plays scissors, the opponent might play scissors again, leading to a tie. Or if the user plays paper, the opponent plays paper. But when the user plays rock, the opponent plays scissors. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be following a pattern of their own. For instance, after a tie, they might repeat the same move. Let's see:\n\nAfter a tie with scissors, the opponent played scissors again. Then, after the user chose scissors and won, the opponent switched to paper. Then, after a tie with paper, the opponent stayed on paper. Then, when the user chose rock, opponent chose scissors. Then user scissors, opponent paper. Then user paper, opponent scissors. Then user rock, opponent scissors. Then user scissors, opponent paper. Then user paper, opponent paper. Then user scissors, opponent scissors. Then user scissors, opponent scissors. Then user scissors, opponent paper. Then user paper, opponent paper. Then user scissors, opponent scissors.\n\nIt's a bit inconsistent. Maybe the opponent is trying to counter the user's previous move. For example, if the user played rock, the opponent plays paper next time. If the user played paper, opponent plays scissors. If the user played scissors, opponent plays rock. But looking at the history:\n\nWhen user played rock, opponent played scissors (user won). Then next time user played scissors, opponent played paper (user won). Then user played paper, opponent played scissors (user lost). Then user played rock, opponent played scissors (user won). Then user played scissors, opponent played paper (user won). Then user played paper, opponent played scissors (user lost). Then user played rock, opponent played paper (user lost). Then user played paper, opponent played paper (tie). Then user played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie). Then user played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie). Then user played scissors, opponent played paper (user won). Then user played paper, opponent played paper (tie). Then user played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie). Now, after scissors vs scissors tie, what next?\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten the user's last move. For example, if the user last played scissors, the opponent might play rock next. But in the last round, user played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie). So if the opponent follows that logic, they might play rock next to beat scissors. But in previous instances, when user played scissors, opponent sometimes played paper (which loses to scissors) or scissors (tie). So maybe the opponent isn't following a strict counter strategy.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to predict the user's next move based on the user's pattern. For example, if the user has been alternating between moves, the opponent might try to anticipate that. But the user's moves have been varying: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, etc. It's hard to see a clear pattern.\n\nGiven that the last two times the user chose scissors, the opponent also chose scissors, resulting in ties. Now, after two consecutive scissors ties, the opponent might expect the user to switch to rock to beat scissors. If the opponent expects the user to switch to rock, they might choose paper to counter. Therefore, if I (the user) choose scissors again, the opponent might stay with scissors or switch to paper. Alternatively, if the opponent thinks I'll switch to rock, they might choose paper. So, to counter that, I could choose scissors to beat their paper. Wait, but if they choose paper, scissors would win. But if they choose scissors again, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they choose rock, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's recent moves: they've been choosing scissors and paper. After two scissors ties, maybe they'll switch to paper expecting me to stay with scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors, but if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I can beat their potential rock, but if they stay with scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is sticking with scissors because it's been working (they tied twice). If they choose scissors again, and I choose rock, I win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if I choose paper, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in the opponent's moves. Let's list the opponent's last few moves based on the hints:\n\nLooking back at the last few rounds:\n\n1. User chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n2. User chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n3. User chose scissors, opponent paper (user won).\n4. User chose paper, opponent paper (tie).\n5. User chose rock, opponent scissors (user won).\n6. User chose scissors, opponent paper (user won).\n7. User chose paper, opponent scissors (user lost).\n8. User chose rock, opponent scissors (user won).\n9. User chose scissors, opponent paper (user won).\n10. User chose paper, opponent paper (tie).\n11. User chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n12. User chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n13. User chose scissors, opponent paper (user won).\n14. User chose paper, opponent paper (tie).\n15. User chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n16. Now, after another scissors tie, what's next?\n\nLooking at the opponent's moves in reverse order:\n\n- scissors (tie)\n- scissors (tie)\n- paper (tie)\n- scissors (tie)\n- paper (user won)\n- scissors (tie)\n- paper (user won)\n- scissors (user lost)\n- paper (user won)\n- scissors (user won)\n- paper (tie)\n- scissors (user won)\n- scissors (user won)\n- paper (user lost)\n- scissors (user won)\n- paper (user won)\n- etc.\n\nIt's hard to see a clear pattern. However, the opponent has chosen scissors three times in a row (last three moves: scissors, scissors, scissors). Wait, no, looking at the last few:\n\nAfter the user's last move was scissors, opponent chose scissors (tie). Before that, user chose scissors, opponent scissors (tie). Before that, user chose scissors, opponent paper (user won). So the opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, paper. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the last few rounds as per the hints:\n\n- The user's last move was scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n- Before that, user scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n- Before that, user scissors, opponent paper (user won).\n- Before that, user paper, opponent paper (tie).\n- Before that, user rock, opponent scissors (user won).\n- Etc.\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves: scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, scissors.\n\nIt's a mix. Maybe the opponent is alternating between paper and scissors but sometimes repeating. For example, after two papers, they switch to scissors, then back to paper. But it's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be reacting to the user's previous move. For example, if the user played scissors last time, the opponent plays scissors again. If the user played paper, opponent plays paper. If the user played rock, opponent plays scissors. But in the case where the user played rock, opponent played scissors (user won), then user played scissors, opponent played paper (user won), then user played paper, opponent played scissors (user lost). So maybe the opponent is trying to counter the user's previous move. For example:\n\n- User plays rock, opponent plays paper (but in the past, when user played rock, opponent played scissors, so that doesn't fit).\n- User plays paper, opponent plays scissors.\n- User plays scissors, opponent plays rock.\n\nBut in reality, when user played scissors, opponent sometimes played scissors or paper. So maybe the opponent isn't following a strict counter strategy.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be using a simple pattern like repeating their last move. For example, if they played scissors last time, they play scissors again. But in the last two moves, they played scissors, then scissors again. So maybe they'll play scissors again. If that's the case, the user should play rock to win. But if the opponent breaks the pattern and switches to paper, then rock would lose.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might be trying to avoid repeating the same move too many times. After two scissors, they might switch to paper. If that's the case, the user should play scissors to beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie.\n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Based on the opponent's recent behavior of choosing scissors twice in a row, maybe they'll switch to paper to avoid being predictable. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. If they choose rock, I lose. But given that they've been choosing scissors and paper more often, rock hasn't been used much by the opponent. The last time the opponent chose rock was... looking back, I don't think the opponent has chosen rock at all. All their moves have been paper or scissors. So maybe the opponent avoids rock. If that's the case, choosing scissors would either tie (if they choose scissors) or win (if they choose paper). Alternatively, choosing rock would only be useful if they choose scissors, which they have done before.\n\nBut given that the opponent hasn't used rock, maybe they are avoiding it. So their options are paper or scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors but lose to paper. If I choose paper, I beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock. Since the opponent isn't using rock, scissors would be safe against paper, and tie with scissors. But if they do start using rock, scissors would lose.\n\nBut given the opponent's history, they might continue with scissors or switch to paper. If they've been using scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to paper. So choosing scissors would beat paper. Alternatively, if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, I lose. But since they haven't used rock before, it's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might think that after two scissors ties, the user will switch to rock, so the opponent chooses paper to counter. In that case, the user should choose scissors to beat paper. But if the opponent thinks that and chooses paper, scissors would win. If the opponent stays with scissors, it's a tie. So the risk is a tie or a win, but not a loss unless they choose rock, which they haven't done.\n\nAlternatively, if the user chooses paper, they can beat rock (unlikely) but lose to scissors. Since the opponent might choose scissors again, paper would lose. So paper is risky.\n\nIf the user chooses rock, they can beat scissors but lose to paper. If the opponent chooses paper, rock loses. If opponent chooses scissors, rock wins. Since the opponent's recent moves are scissors, maybe they'll choose scissors again, so rock would win. But if they switch to paper, rock loses.\n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. Without a clear pattern, it's hard to predict. However, considering the opponent's tendency to use scissors and paper, and the recent two scissors, maybe they'll switch to paper. Therefore, choosing scissors would be the best move to beat paper. If they stay with scissors, it's a tie. If they switch to paper, it's a win. The risk of them choosing rock is low based on history.\n\nSo, the final decision is to choose scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent and I both just played scissors, resulting in a tie. They've been switching between moves, but there's a pattern here. Let me look back at the previous rounds.\n\nIn the last few rounds, the opponent has used paper three times, then scissors twice, and now scissors again. Wait, the last two moves were scissors ties. So after the three papers, they went to scissors, and now we've had two consecutive scissors ties. Hmm. Maybe they're sticking with scissors for a bit, or they might switch to rock to counter my possible scissors again.\n\nBut if they think I'll play scissors again, they might go for rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. But if they stick with scissors, paper would lose. Wait, no. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper. So if they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they stay with scissors, I should play rock. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between moves. Let's check the history:\n\n- They played paper three times (ties and a loss for me).\n- Then scissors, which I countered with rock, winning.\n- Then they switched to paper again, which I countered with scissors, winning.\n- Then they went back to scissors, which I countered with rock again, winning.\n- Then they tried paper again, which I countered with scissors again, winning.\n- Then they went back to scissors, leading to a tie.\n- Then scissors again, another tie.\n\nWait, the recent pattern seems like they might be sticking with scissors, but after two ties, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might go paper. But if I play scissors again, and they switch to rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stay with scissors, another tie. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. I've been switching between rock, scissors, and paper. Let me see:\n\nMy last moves were: paper (tie), scissors (tie), scissors (tie). Wait, no. Let me check the actual sequence:\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. I played paper, opponent paper (tie).\n2. I played scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n3. I played paper, opponent scissors (I lost).\n4. I played rock, opponent scissors (I won).\n5. I played scissors, opponent paper (I won).\n6. I played paper, opponent paper (tie).\n7. I played scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n8. I played scissors again, opponent scissors (tie again).\n\nSo the opponent's last three moves were scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no. Let me recount based on the hints provided:\n\nFrom the user's messages, the opponent's recent moves (as per the hints) after the last few rounds:\n\n- When I played rock, opponent scissors (I won).\n- Then I played scissors, opponent paper (I won).\n- Then I played paper, opponent paper (tie).\n- Then I played scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n- Then I played scissors again, opponent scissors (tie again).\n\nWait, the opponent's last three moves were scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors? Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me parse each round's outcome as per the hints:\n\nLooking at the user's previous messages:\n\n- After I played rock, opponent scissors (win).\n- Then scissors, opponent paper (win).\n- Then paper, opponent paper (tie).\n- Then scissors, opponent scissors (tie).\n- Then scissors again, opponent scissors (tie).\n- Then scissors again, opponent scissors (tie again).\n\nWait, the last three rounds all ended in scissors vs scissors. So the opponent has played scissors three times in a row. That's a pattern. If they keep choosing scissors, I should play rock to beat them. But maybe they'll switch now, expecting me to counter with rock. So they might play paper to beat my rock. But if I play scissors again, and they play paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I can play rock.\n\nBut given that they've played scissors three times, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they go paper. So I should counter that by playing scissors to beat their paper. Wait, but if they play paper, scissors would win. If they play rock, scissors lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with scissors because it's safe (ties when I also play scissors). But after three ties, they might try to change. If I play rock now, and they switch to paper, I lose. If they stay with scissors, I win. It's a gamble. Alternatively, play paper. If they switch to rock, I win. If they stay with scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're following a pattern of repeating scissors until I change. Since I've been playing scissors and getting ties, they might expect me to switch to rock. So they might switch to paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they actually stay with scissors, it's a tie again. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent is a bot that's mirroring my previous move. Wait, but in the last three rounds, I played scissors each time, and they also played scissors. So if they're mirroring, they'll play whatever I played last. But I played scissors last, so they might play scissors again. Then I should play rock. But if they're not mirroring, maybe they're random.\n\nAlternatively, since they've played scissors three times, it's statistically less likely they'll do it a fourth time. So maybe they'll switch. But in reality, players can be unpredictable. However, given the history, the safest bet might be to play rock, hoping they continue with scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, play paper to counter a possible switch to rock. But if they stay with scissors, paper loses. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, use a mixed strategy. Since they've been using scissors a lot, maybe rock is the best choice. But given the risk of them switching, perhaps a different approach. Wait, the highest reward is for paper beating rock (3 points), but the penalty is also higher (-3). So maybe it's better to go for safer moves with lower risk. Rock gives 1 point if they play scissors, -3 if they play paper. Scissors gives 1 if they play paper, -1 if they play rock. Paper gives 3 if they play rock, -1 if they play scissors.\n\nGiven that the opponent has been using scissors three times, the probability they'll switch increases. But if I play rock, and they switch to paper, I lose 3. If I play paper, and they switch to rock, I gain 3. If I play scissors, and they switch to paper, I gain 1. Alternatively, if they stay with scissors, rock gains 1, scissors ties, paper loses 1.\n\nSo the best expected value might be to play rock, assuming they might stay with scissors. But if they switch, it's risky. Alternatively, play scissors again, hoping they stay with scissors for a tie, but that's not gaining points. Alternatively, switch to paper to catch a possible rock, but if they play scissors, I lose. Hmm.\n\nGiven the previous three ties with scissors, maybe the opponent is also getting frustrated and will switch. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to paper, I should play scissors. But without knowing, it's a guess. Alternatively, use a counter to their possible switch. If they've been using scissors, maybe they'll go to rock next. So I play paper. But if they go to paper, I tie. If they go to scissors, I lose. Alternatively, if they go to rock, I win with paper. If they go to paper, tie. If they go scissors, lose. So maybe paper is a middle ground.\n\nAlternatively, since they've been using scissors, and if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they actually play rock, I lose. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to break the cycle. Since we've had three scissors ties, they might expect me to play rock. So they play paper. Therefore, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they instead play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I can play rock. It's a gamble. Given the previous pattern, maybe they'll switch. So I'll go with scissors to beat their expected paper.\n",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
