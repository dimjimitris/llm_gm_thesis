    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the point structure of this modified rock-paper-scissors game:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3 points)\n   - Rock losing to paper has the highest penalty (-3 points)\n   - Other win/loss combinations only give +1/-1 points\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2.

Expected value calculation (assuming equal probability of opponent's moves):\n   - Paper: (3 + (-1) + 0)/3 = 2/3 point average\n   - Rock: (1 + (-3) + 0)/3 = -2/3 point average\n   - Scissors: (1 + (-1) + 0)/3 = 0 point average\n\n4.

Looking at my opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n\n3. I notice a clear alternating pattern between scissors and paper in my opponent's last six moves.\n\n4. If this pattern continues, they'll play scissors in this round.\n\n5. Given the high-stakes nature of the game (-3 for playing rock against paper), I need to be cautious about their pattern possibly changing.\n\n6. However, the alternating pattern is too strong to ignore, and it predicts scissors next.\n\n7. To counter scissors, rock would be my best play (+1 point if I win).\n\n8. This also protects against the risk of another large loss if they play paper again and I choose scissors.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at my opponent's recent moves:\n   - What I thought was an alternating pattern (scissors-paper) has been broken by their rock play\n   \n3. Examining what my opponent does after ties:\n   - After our first tie (Round 1), they played scissors\n   - After our second tie (Round 4), they played rock\n   - After our third tie (Round 10), they played scissors\n   - Now after our fourth tie (Round 13), what will they play?\n\n4. After rock-rock ties specifically:\n   - In Round 4, we tied with rock, and they played rock again in Round 5\n\n5. Players often switch moves after a tie, and given that we just tied with rock, they might expect me to play rock again or switch to paper.\n\n6. If they expect me to play rock or paper, they would likely play paper or scissors respectively.\n\n7. Given their previous behaviors and game theory principles, scissors seems like a reasonable move that could counter their likely paper play.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyzing the complete pattern of our rounds:\n   - Round 1: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 4: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3)\n   - Round 9: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 10: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3)\n   - Round 13: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n   - Round 20: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3)\n   - Round 21: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1)\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1)\n\n2. I've now won seven rounds in a row, which is an extraordinary streak. My opponent must be desperate to break this pattern.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after losing with paper specifically:\n   - In Round 3, they lost with paper and played rock next\n   - In Round 7, they lost with paper and played rock next\n   - In Round 14, they lost with paper and played scissors next\n   - In Round 16, they lost with paper and played rock next\n   - In Round 19, they lost with paper and played rock next\n\n4. After losing with paper, they played rock 4 out of 5 times, which is a strong pattern.\n\n5. I also notice that my last six moves have followed a perfect cycle: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n6. If my opponent has noticed this pattern, they might expect me to play paper next and try to counter with scissors.\n\n7. However, their own pattern of playing rock after paper losses is stronger (4/5 occurrences), so I'll give that more weight.\n\n8. If I expect them to play rock, paper would be my optimal move (+3 points).\n\n[move] paper"

I've now won eight rounds in a row, which is an incredible streak.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent does after losing with rock specifically:\n   - In Round 8, they lost with rock and played scissors next\n   - In Round 17, they lost with rock and played scissors next\n   - In Round 20, they lost with rock and played scissors next\n\n4. There's a perfect pattern - after losing with rock, they have played scissors 3 out of 3 times.\n\n5. I also notice my own pattern over the last several rounds has been scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, repeated perfectly.\n\n6. If I expect them to play scissors based on their consistent pattern after rock losses, rock would be my optimal move (+1 point).\n\n7. This prediction method has been working consistently, and I have a significant winning streak using it.\n\n[move] rock"
