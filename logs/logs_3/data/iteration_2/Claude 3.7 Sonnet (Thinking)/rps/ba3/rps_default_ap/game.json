However, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beating rock has the highest payoff (3 points)\n- Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper have lower payoffs (1 point)\n\nGiven this payoff structure, if my opponent is playing completely randomly (with equal probability for each move), my expected value for each move would be:\n- Rock: 1/3 chance of beating scissors (+1 point), 1/3 chance of losing to paper (-3 points), 1/3 chance of tying with rock (0 points)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 3/3 = -2/3\n- Paper: 1/3 chance of beating rock (+3 points), 1/3 chance of losing to scissors (-1 points), 1/3 chance of tying with paper (0 points)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3\n- Scissors: 1/3 chance of beating paper (+1 point), 1/3 chance of losing to rock (-1 points), 1/3 chance of tying with scissors (0 points)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, if my opponent plays randomly, the optimal strategy is to play paper, which has the highest expected value.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that people playing rock-paper-scissors for the first time often choose rock as their initial move. If I anticipate my opponent will play rock, then paper would be the best response, giving me 3 points.\n\nGiven both the mathematical analysis and the psychological tendency of first-time players, I'll choose paper for my first move.",

If they play scissors expecting to beat my paper, my rock would beat their scissors. If they play paper again, I'd lose but the penalty is higher than the potential gain (-3 vs +1).\n\nI'll choose rock for this round.",

They haven't played rock yet. Based on this limited data, they seem to favor paper. Playing scissors would be a good counter to paper.\n\nAlso, since paper beats rock for 3 points (versus scissors beating paper for only 1 point), the opponent might be incentivized to play paper more often.

If they're copying my previous move, then they should play scissors this round. In that case, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\nHowever, if they're trying to beat my previous move (which could explain Round 3), then they would play paper to beat my scissors from Round 4. In that case, I should play scissors to beat their paper.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser\n- scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nSince paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3), if I think there's a decent chance my opponent will play rock, I should play paper.

If they're following a pattern, they might play paper next. But if they're adapting to my moves, they might expect me to play rock (to beat their expected scissors) and thus play paper.\n\nLet's go with rock since:\n1. If they play scissors (continuing their recent trend), I win (+1 point)\n2. If they play paper, I lose (-3 points)\n3. If they play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe risk is higher with paper (I could lose -1 with scissors), but the reward is higher too (+3 vs rock). However, since I've played paper twice recently, my opponent might expect me to play paper again, which makes scissors more likely from them.\n\nI'll play rock as it seems to have the best risk/reward given the pattern so far.",

Let me count how many times they've played each move:\n- Paper: 10 times\n- Scissors: 9 times\n- Rock: 3 times\n\nThe opponent seems to favor paper and scissors, with much less rock.\n\nThe last few moves from the opponent have been:\n- Round 18: Scissors\n- Round 19: Scissors\n- Round 20: Scissors\n- Round 21: Paper\n- Round 22: Paper\n\nIt looks like they might be starting to repeat moves in sequences (multiple scissors, then multiple papers). Given that they just played paper twice, they might play paper again, or they might switch to scissors as they've done before.\n\nIf I predict they'll play paper again, I should play scissors.\nIf I predict they'll switch to scissors, I should play rock.\nIf I predict they'll switch to rock, I should play paper.\n\nSince they've shown a preference for paper and scissors, and they've just played paper twice, there's a decent chance they'll either play paper again or switch to scissors. Paper beats rock, so even if they switch to rock, I would only lose 1 point (versus losing 3 points if they play scissors when I play paper).\n\nI think the safest bet for this round is scissors.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
