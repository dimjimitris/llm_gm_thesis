    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Many players might choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's a common initial choice.\n\n5. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses rock, I gain 3 points (the maximum possible).\n\n6. If my opponent chooses scissors against my paper, I only lose 1 point.\n\n7.

Looking at possible scenarios:\n   - If I play rock and they play scissors again, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and they switched to paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If I play scissors and they play scissors again, we tie (0 points)\n   - If I play scissors and they switched to paper, I win 1 point\n\n4.

Let me analyze the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost 1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won 3 points)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won 1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won 3 points)\n\n2. The opponent has maintained their predictable pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - Round 3: paper\n   - Round 4: scissors\n   - Round 5: rock\n   - Round 6: paper\n   - Round 7: scissors\n   - Round 8: rock\n   - Round 9: paper\n   - Round 10: scissors\n   - Round 11: rock\n\n3. If this pattern continues, they'll play paper next.\n\n4. Against paper:\n   - Scissors would win me 1 point\n   - Paper would tie (0 points)\n   - Rock would lose me 3 points\n\n5. I've now won 9 consecutive rounds by exploiting this pattern, which makes it virtually certain they're not changing their strategy.\n\n6. Despite the extensive losing streak they're experiencing, they continue following the same pattern.\n\n7. Scissors is the optimal play to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"
