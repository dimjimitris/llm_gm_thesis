Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential gain (+3) when it wins.\n\n4. Many players might choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games, as it's a common initial choice.\n\n5. If I choose paper and my opponent chooses rock, I gain 3 points (the maximum possible).\n\n6. If my opponent chooses scissors against my paper, I only lose 1 point.\n\n7.

      "reasoning_text": "I'm playing a classic rock-paper-scissors game with modified scoring:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same moves result in a tie with 0 points\n\nI need to choose my first move in this game against a fresh player. Let me think about the strategy:\n\n1. In standard rock-paper-scissors, no single move is inherently better than others if players are playing randomly.\n\n2. However, the scoring here is asymmetric. Paper beating rock gives 3 points while the other victories only give 1 point. This means:\n   - Winning with paper gives the highest reward (3 points)\n   - Losing to paper gives the highest penalty (-3 points)\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their tendencies or patterns.\n\n4. Given the asymmetric scoring, there might be a tendency for players to choose rock (hoping to win big with paper) or choose paper directly (for the high payoff).\n\n5. If I expect the opponent might prefer paper due to its higher payoff, scissors would be my counter.\n\n6. If I expect the opponent might predict this thinking and choose rock to beat expected scissors, I should choose paper.\n\n7. In the absence of prior information, I might want to choose based on the expected value calculation:\n   - If opponents randomly select moves (1/3 probability for each):\n     - Rock: (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(1) = -2/3\n     - Paper: (1/3)(3) + (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(-1) = 2/3\n     - Scissors: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\n   Based on expected value with random play, paper has the highest expected value.\n\n8. However, human players often don't play truly randomly. Many beginners tend to start with rock. If that's the case, paper would be advantageous.\n\nTaking all these considerations into account, I'm going to choose paper for my first move. It has positive expected value against random play and could win big against potential rock-favoring opponents.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
