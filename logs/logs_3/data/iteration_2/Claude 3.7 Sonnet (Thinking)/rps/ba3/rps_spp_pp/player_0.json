    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper has the highest reward (3 points) when it wins against rock, while rock and scissors only award 1 point when they win. However, losing with rock costs -3 points, making it the riskiest option.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no established pattern, we should consider what most players tend to choose in their first move. Rock is often a popular first choice for many players.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given the payoff structure, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio. If we play paper and the opponent plays rock, we gain 3 points. If they play scissors, we only lose 1 point. If they play paper too, it's a tie with no points lost.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. In this modified game, paper has a strategic advantage as the expected value is higher than the other options when considering all possible opponent moves.\n\n[move] paper"

This gives us valuable information to work with.\n\nStrategic Thinker: The opponent might stick with scissors since it worked for them, or they might anticipate that we'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors) and thus switch to paper themselves.\n\nPsychologist: Fresh players often follow certain patterns: they might stick with their winning move, rotate through options systematically, or try to predict and counter our next move.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's examine the risk-reward ratios again. Rock would counter their scissors if they repeat, but it's vulnerable to a paper play. Given that scissors worked for them last time, many players would be inclined to repeat their successful move.\n\nGame Theorist: I think playing rock is justified here. If they stick with scissors, we gain a point. If they switch to paper anticipating our rock, we lose 3 points, but that requires more sophisticated thinking which might be less common in a fresh player.\n\n[move] rock"

Since we both played rock last time, they might anticipate us playing paper and therefore play scissors to counter us.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at potential outcomes: If we play scissors and they play paper (completing their cycle), we gain 1 point. If they play scissors anticipating our paper, we tie and lose nothing. Scissors seems to have the best risk-reward ratio in this situation.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

If they anticipate that we've figured them out and try to counter our expected move, they might play paper (expecting us to play rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Given what we know, rock seems to be the most strategically sound move.
