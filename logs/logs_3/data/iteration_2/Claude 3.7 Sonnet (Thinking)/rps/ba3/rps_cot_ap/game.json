I'm playing against a fresh player, so I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n3. Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3) but also highest risk (-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives moderate reward (+1) and moderate risk (-1)\n   - Scissors beating paper gives moderate reward (+1) and moderate risk (-1)\n4. Since this is the first round, I need to consider what a new player might choose.\n5. Many players tend to choose rock as their first move in rock-paper-scissors games.\n6. Playing paper would give me the highest potential gain if my opponent chooses rock.\n7. While paper carries risk (losing to scissors), the potential reward outweighs the risk in this first round.\n\n[move] paper"

Looking at my options:\n   - If I play rock: I beat scissors (+1) but lose to paper (-3)\n   - If I play scissors: I tie with scissors (0) and beat paper (+1)\n   - If I play paper: I lose to scissors again (-1) and tie with paper (0)\n5. Since my opponent just used scissors successfully, there's a chance they'll use it again\n6. Playing rock would counter scissors, but carries a high risk (-3) if they switch to paper\n7. Playing scissors would result in a tie if they use scissors again, and would win if they switch to paper\n8. The safest option with positive expected value appears to be scissors\n\n[move] scissors"

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, which suggests:\n   - They may prefer scissors as their go-to move\n   - They might continue this pattern for a third round\n   - They could anticipate I'll counter with rock and switch to paper\n\n3.

Since my opponent has shown a clear preference for scissors so far, playing rock would be the natural counter.\n\n5. The risk is that they might anticipate this and switch to paper, which would cost me 3 points.\n\n6.

My opponent follows a simple pattern: they always play what would have beaten my previous move.\n\nThe pattern is:\n- After I play rock, they play paper\n- After I play paper, they play scissors  \n- After I play scissors, they play rock\n\nIn Round 22, I played scissors and won against their paper. Following the pattern, in Round 23, they will play rock.\n\nIf they play rock:\n- If I play paper, I'll win (+3 points)\n- If I play scissors, I'll lose (-1 point)\n- If I play rock, it will be a tie (0 points)\n\nGiven their predictable pattern, the optimal choice is to play paper to win +3 points.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
