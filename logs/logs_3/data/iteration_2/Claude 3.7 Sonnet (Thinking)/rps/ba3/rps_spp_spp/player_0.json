    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The traditional cyclic dominance is maintained, but paper beating rock has a higher payoff (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1). This asymmetry is significant for strategy development.\n\nPsychological Strategist: For the first move against a fresh player, we should consider what most people instinctively choose. Rock is statistically the most common first move in RPS games (roughly 35-36% of first moves), as many players perceive it as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the asymmetric payoffs, let's evaluate each option:\n- Playing rock: Safe against scissors (+1), but high risk against paper (-3)\n- Playing paper: Highest potential reward (+3) against rock, moderate risk against scissors (-1)\n- Playing scissors: Moderate reward (+1) against paper, high risk against rock (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: In a one-shot game with these payoffs, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio. If the opponent chooses rock (most common first move), we get +3. If they choose scissors, we lose only 1 point. If they choose paper, it's a tie.\n\nAI Assistant (me): That makes sense. Since this is the first move against a fresh player, and rock is statistically the most common opening move, paper seems like the optimal choice. It maximizes our potential gain while minimizing potential loss.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: Interesting! Both players chose paper in the first round. Now we need to predict how our opponent will adjust their strategy. In RPS games, there's a psychological tendency to shift moves after a tie.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Indeed. After a tie, many players tend to either:\n1. Stick with the same move, thinking the opponent will change\n2. Move to the next option in the cycle (paper \u2192 scissors)\n3. Try to counter what they think the opponent will do next\n\nGiven that paper was tied, there's a higher probability the opponent will switch to scissors thinking we might stay with paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze our options again considering this new information:\n- Rock: Good defensive move if opponent shifts to scissors (+1), but still vulnerable to repeated paper (-3)\n- Paper: Risky if opponent shifts to scissors (-1), neutral if they repeat paper, good if they shift to rock (+3)\n- Scissors: High potential if opponent repeats paper (+1), risky if they shift to rock (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the payoff matrix and the psychological tendency to shift after a tie, rock provides the best expected value in this situation. It counters the most likely move (scissors) while avoiding the highest possible loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree. Since both players chose paper in the first round, there's a psychological tendency for the opponent to shift to scissors. Playing rock would counter this with a +1 payoff. While there's still a risk they might stick with paper (-3), based on common patterns in RPS games, shifting to scissors is more likely after a tie.\n\nRisk Analyst: Also note that even if we're wrong and they use paper again, the game continues, so we can adjust in future rounds. The asymmetric payoff does make rock somewhat riskier, but I still think it's our best option given what we know.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

Given that the opponent lost using scissors against our rock, they're likely to play paper next for two reasons:\n1. It follows their observed cyclical pattern (paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper)\n2.

Looking closer, the opponent appears to be following a simple cycle: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.

Switch to paper (anticipating you'll switch to rock)\n\nBased on the opponent's previous behavior, they seem adaptable rather than following a simple pattern.

An interesting pattern is emerging - they've played scissors in rounds 2, 4, and 6, and they've played rock in rounds 3 and 5.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This looks like an alternating pattern with scissors in even-numbered rounds and rock in odd-numbered rounds (except for the first round). Players often fall into unconscious patterns, and this one seems quite clear. If they continue this pattern, they'll likely play rock in this round (7), as it's an odd number.\n\nAdditionally, after consecutive losses, players often become more predictable as they try to \"reset\" their strategy and fall back on patterns.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the payoff structure and our pattern recognition:\n- If opponent plays rock (likely based on their pattern): Paper would win big (+3), scissors would lose (-1)\n- If opponent plays scissors (breaking pattern): Rock would win (+1), paper would lose (-1)\n- If opponent plays paper (less likely): Scissors would win (+1), rock would lose (-3)\n\nGame Theorist: Paper maximizes our expected value if we believe the opponent will follow their established pattern of playing rock in odd-numbered rounds.

This is significant - players who are on a winning streak often:\n1. Continue with their last winning move (rock in this case)\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter their last winning move and play accordingly (expecting us to play paper, they might play scissors)\n\nHowever, most players tend to favor repeating a winning move, especially when it just gave them a victory. Given their history of repeating rock (rounds 3,5,9), there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with rock.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our recent losses and the asymmetric payoffs, we need to manage risk while seeking recovery:\n- Rock: Would tie with rock, win against scissors (+1), lose heavily to paper (-3)\n- Paper: Would win significantly against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1)\n- Scissors: Would lose against rock (-1), win against paper (+1), tie with scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Paper offers the highest expected value here. If they repeat rock (quite plausible after winning), we gain +3 points. If they anticipate our paper play and switch to scissors, we only lose 1 point. Given our recent losses, this risk-reward profile makes sense.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with this analysis. The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat winning moves, particularly rock. After just winning with rock, there's a good chance they'll stay with it. Playing paper gives us the highest potential gain (+3) with a manageable downside (-1) if wrong. After consecutive losses, this balanced approach gives us the best chance to recover our position while managing risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has now won three consecutive rounds with different moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), suggesting sophisticated adaptation.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a concerning development. The opponent has demonstrated an ability to anticipate our moves in the last three rounds. Looking at their full sequence:\npaper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nAfter three consecutive wins, players typically exhibit one of these behaviors:\n1. Continue their adaptive strategy (which has been working)\n2. Fall back to a move they're most comfortable with (scissors appears 4 times, more than others)\n3. Complete a pattern (they've just played scissors, so rock would complete their rock-paper-scissors cycle)\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our recent losses and the asymmetric payoffs:\n- Rock would beat scissors (+1), lose heavily to paper (-3)\n- Paper would beat rock (+3), lose to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors would beat paper (+1), lose to rock (-1)\n\nSince the opponent has shown adaptive play, we need to be less predictable while managing risk.\n\nGame Theorist: Rock offers a reasonable risk-reward profile here. If they revert to scissors (their most frequent play), we win. If they complete the cycle with rock, we tie. Only if they play paper do we face a significant loss.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with the rock play. The opponent has shown adaptive strategy, but scissors has been their most frequent move historically (4 appearances). Additionally, if they're following any form of cyclical thinking after scissors, they might play rock. Rock gives us the potential to win against scissors (+1) while tying against rock. While there's risk of a paper counter (-3), we need to break our losing streak, and rock offers the best balance of opportunity and risk management at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent has established dominance by correctly anticipating our moves for four straight rounds. We need to break their pattern recognition. Looking at their recent play, they've completed a full cycle from paper back to paper.\n\nAfter multiple wins, especially with a significant win like the last round, players often:\n1. Stick with their last successful move (paper in this case)\n2. Shift to what they think would counter our expected adjustment\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now in a very difficult position with four consecutive losses. Our total score has likely declined significantly. We need to prioritize breaking this pattern while managing risk:\n- If they stick with paper (fairly likely after big win): Scissors would win (+1)\n- If they shift to rock anticipating scissors: We'd lose again (-1)\n- If they shift to scissors anticipating paper: We'd lose again (-1)\n\nGame Theorist: At this point, standard game theory would suggest introducing randomness to become less predictable. However, given the asymmetric payoffs and our losing streak, scissors offers the best immediate potential to break their momentum. If they repeat paper (a common tendency after success), we gain. If they switch, our loss is limited to -1.\n\nAI Assistant (me): I agree with playing scissors. The opponent has shown remarkable adaptation, winning four consecutive rounds by correctly anticipating our moves. Their most recent success was with paper, and there's a psychological tendency to repeat winning moves, especially after significant victories. Scissors gives us the chance to win (+1) if they stick with paper, while limiting our downside to -1 if wrong. At this point, breaking their winning streak is critical, and scissors offers our best chance to do that while managing risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent has demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict our moves. They may have identified a pattern in our thinking or decision-making process.\n\nAt this point, with five consecutive losses, we need to acknowledge that conventional pattern analysis isn't working. The opponent might be:\n1. Using a sophisticated algorithm or strategy beyond simple patterns\n2. Successfully reading our adjustments after losses\n3. Employing a counter-strategy specifically designed against our approach\n\nRisk Analyst: Our current situation is dire. We've lost five consecutive rounds with a significant negative score. Traditional risk management suggests:\n1. When a strategy clearly isn't working, a fundamental change is needed\n2. The asymmetric payoffs make paper the highest reward option (+3) with moderate risk (-1)\n3. Given our position, we should prioritize potential upside over avoiding further losses\n\nGame Theorist: I recommend a shift in approach. Given the opponent's last two moves (paper \u2192 rock), there's a reasonable chance they might play scissors next to complete the cycle. If so, rock would counter this effectively (+1). While we risk another paper counter (-3), at this point we need to break their momentum.\n\nAI Assistant (me): After five consecutive losses, I agree we need a fundamental change. The opponent has demonstrated remarkable prediction ability, but we haven't tried playing the same move twice in a row yet. This might break their pattern recognition. Given their last play was rock, and they might expect us to play paper, I'll play paper despite this expectation. If they counter with scissors as anticipated, we lose minimally (-1). But if they've been using our adaptation patterns to predict us, this break in our behavior might catch them off guard.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They're following a classic rotation of paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 etc. This cycle has repeated twice in their last six moves.\n\nIn such a situation, when an opponent shows a clear cyclical pattern, especially after multiple successes, they're likely to:\n1.
