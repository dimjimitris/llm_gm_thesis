    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the point system first:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n   - Paper beats rock (+3/-3 points)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1/-1 points)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points)\n\n2. Since this is a fresh opponent with no history, I need to consider the expected value of each move assuming random play:\n   - Rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points on average\n   - Paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3 points on average\n   - Scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points on average\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value because:\n   - The high reward for beating rock (+3) outweighs the small penalty for losing to scissors (-1)\n   - The other options have worse or neutral expected values\n\n4. Against a fresh player with no established pattern, the optimal first move is paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Evaluating opponent's most recent moves:\n   - Looking at their last few moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They played scissors twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern\n   - This could indicate a new strategy or an attempt to confuse me\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - After our tie, they might expect me to play rock to counter scissors\n   - If they anticipate rock, they might play paper to counter it\n   - Alternatively, they might try to establish a new pattern or return to their original one\n   - There's increased uncertainty about their next move\n\n4. Risk-reward analysis:\n   - Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) with minimal risk (-1)\n   - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors or starting a pattern): I win +3\n   - If they play paper (anticipating my rock): I tie (0)\n   - If they play scissors again: I lose only -1\n\n[move] paper"
