    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Analyzing the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock has higher stakes (+3/-3) than other combinations (+1/-1)\n   - This means paper has the highest potential reward when it wins\n\n4. What might a rational first-time player do?\n   - They might be drawn to paper since it offers the highest reward (+3)\n   - Alternatively, they might avoid rock since losing with rock is costly (-3)\n\n5. My counter-strategy:\n   - If I expect them to play paper, scissors would be optimal\n   - If I lose with scissors to rock, I only lose 1 point instead of 3\n\n6. Balancing risk and reward, scissors seems to be a strategic first move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Weighing my options for this round:\n   - If my opponent plays rock again (which is likely since it worked), paper would be optimal\n   - If my opponent anticipates me switching to paper and plays scissors, I would lose only 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays paper (least likely scenario), I would tie\n\n4.

Identifying clear opponent patterns:\n   - After losing with scissors, opponent consistently plays paper:\n     - After round 3 loss with scissors \u2192 played paper in round 4\n     - After round 6 loss with scissors \u2192 played paper in round 7\n     - After round 8 loss with scissors \u2192 played paper in round 9\n\n3. Predicting next move:\n   - They just lost with scissors again in round 11\n   - Based on their consistent pattern, they're highly likely to play paper next\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play paper (highly likely given established pattern): scissors would be optimal (+1)\n   - If they break pattern and play rock: scissors would lose (-1)\n   - If they play scissors again (extremely unlikely): scissors would tie (0)\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Given their remarkably consistent pattern after losing with scissors, I'll counter their expected paper play\n\n[move] scissors"
