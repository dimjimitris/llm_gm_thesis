    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyzing our complete game history:\n   - Round 1: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors - I won\n   - Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock - I won\n   - Round 5: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors - I won\n   - Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors - I lost\n   - Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n   - Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n   - Round 10: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n   - Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n   - Round 14: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper - I lost\n   - Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n   - Round 16: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock - I won\n   - Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n   - Round 18: Both scissors (tie)\n   - Round 19: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n   - Round 20: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 21: Both paper (tie)\n   - Round 22: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors - I lost\n   - Round 23: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper - I lost\n\n2. My total score is now -1 point (seven wins, eight losses).\n\n3. I've lost two consecutive rounds now.\n\n4. After winning with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Use paper again since it was successful\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll use paper to counter their paper\n   - Use scissors expecting me to choose rock\n\n5. Since they've won consecutive rounds with different moves (scissors then paper), they're demonstrating strong adaptability.\n\n6. They seem to be reading my strategy well and staying one step ahead.\n\n7. If they expect me to use paper, they'll likely choose rock.\n\n8. To break this cycle, I need to anticipate their anticipation.\n\n9. I'll choose scissors, which would beat rock if they choose it.\n\n[move] scissors"
