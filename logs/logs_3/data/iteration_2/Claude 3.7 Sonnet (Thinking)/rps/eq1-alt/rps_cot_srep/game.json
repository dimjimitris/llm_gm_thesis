In traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Paper beats rock\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut in this variant:\n- Paper beats scissors (opposite of traditional)\n- Rock beats paper (same as traditional)\n- Scissors beats rock (opposite of traditional)\n\nSo the winning relationships are reversed in 2 out of 3 cases compared to the traditional game.\n\nNow, I need to formulate a strategy. I'm playing against a fresh player, so I don't have any information about their past behavior or patterns.\n\nIn this modified game, let me think about what might be a good first move:\n1. If I choose paper, I beat scissors but lose to rock\n2. If I choose rock, I beat paper but lose to scissors\n3. If I choose scissors, I beat rock but lose to paper\n\nWithout any prior information about my opponent, there's no clear advantage to any particular move. Each move wins against one option and loses against another.\n\nIn standard Rock, Paper, Scissors, people often initially choose rock as their first move, as it represents strength psychologically. If my opponent follows that tendency, choosing scissors would be advantageous in this variant since scissors beats rock. However, if they're aware of the modified rules, they might adjust their strategy.\n\nGiven the lack of information, I'll choose scissors as my first move. If I get to play multiple rounds, I can then adjust based on my opponent's patterns.",

I'll make a strategic choice based on what I think is most likely:\n\nSince we both chose scissors in round 1, there's a good chance they'll expect me to switch. The most straightforward counter to scissors in traditional RPS would be rock, but in this variant, scissors actually beats rock. So if they think conventionally, they might choose rock expecting to beat my scissors, but would actually lose to scissors.\n\nHowever, if they understand the variant rules well, they might choose paper to beat my scissors.\n\nI'll choose rock for this round.

This suggests they've found a pattern in my play or they're simply finding success with rock.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- When I use paper, they use rock and win\n- When I use scissors, they have used rock (I won) or paper (I lost)\n- When I use rock, they have used paper (I won) or scissors (I lost)\n\nThey seem to have adjusted to the reversed rules well. Their repeated use of rock against my paper suggests they're confident I'll choose paper, which has been true for rounds 13, 15, and 17.\n\nI need to break their successful pattern with rock. Since they've used rock in the last round (and in 3 of the last 5 rounds), they might:\n1. Use rock again since it's been successful against my paper\n2. Anticipate I'll use scissors to counter their rock and switch to paper\n3. Use scissors thinking I'll try to use rock to beat their expected paper\n\nGiven their strong tendency toward rock recently, I think scissors is my best move. If they use rock again (which seems likely), I'll win. If they switch to paper anticipating my scissors, I'll lose. If they switch to scissors, we'll tie.\n\nI'll choose scissors for this round.",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the complete game history:\n- Round 1: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 2: Both rock (tie)\n- Round 3: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors - I won\n- Round 4: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock - I won\n- Round 5: I chose paper, opponent chose scissors - I won\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 7: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors - I lost\n- Round 8: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n- Round 9: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n- Round 10: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 11: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 12: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n- Round 13: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n- Round 14: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper - I lost\n- Round 15: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n- Round 16: I chose scissors, opponent chose rock - I won\n- Round 17: I chose paper, opponent chose rock - I lost\n- Round 18: Both scissors (tie)\n- Round 19: I chose rock, opponent chose paper - I won\n- Round 20: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 21: Both paper (tie)\n- Round 22: I chose rock, opponent chose scissors - I lost\n- Round 23: I chose scissors, opponent chose paper - I lost\n\nMy total score is now -1 point (seven wins, eight losses).\n\nI've lost two consecutive rounds now. My opponent has won with scissors against my rock and paper against my scissors.\n\nAfter winning with paper against my scissors, they might:\n- Use paper again since it was successful\n- Switch to rock anticipating I'll use paper to counter their paper\n- Use scissors expecting me to choose rock\n\nAfter consecutive wins, players often feel confident and might stick with their successful move, so paper is a possibility.\n\nHowever, they've also demonstrated good adaptability and anticipation throughout the game.\n\nLet me think about what they're likely expecting me to do:\n- They might think I'll use rock to counter their paper\n- They might think I'll stick with scissors expecting them to change\n- They might think I'll use paper anticipating they'll switch to scissors\n\nGiven their recent success and adaptability, I think they're most likely to:\n1. Either stick with paper (since it worked)\n2. Or switch to rock (anticipating I'll use paper)\n\nIf they choose paper, rock would beat paper in our variant.\nIf they choose rock, scissors would beat rock in our variant.\n\nSince they've shown ability to stay one step ahead, and I've lost two in a row, I need to break my pattern. They might expect me to choose paper, so they might choose rock. In that case, scissors would be my best move.\n\nI'll choose scissors for this round.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
