Let me double check...\n\nLooking at it again, I think there's definitely a mistake in the rules as stated. The normal Rock, Paper, Scissors would be:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nBut I'll play according to the rules as they were given:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nFor my first move, without any prior information about my opponent's strategy, I'll choose randomly among the three options.

In rock-paper-scissors, there's no dominant strategy since each move beats one option and loses to another. However, people often have patterns in their play. One common pattern is to switch after a tie, so my opponent might switch from rock to something else.\n\nSince we both played rock last time and it was a tie, my opponent might expect me to change my move as well. They could anticipate that I'll play paper (since paper beats rock), and therefore they might play scissors to beat my anticipated paper move.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I think playing rock again could be effective - it would beat their scissors if they make this prediction. Alternatively, I could play paper expecting them to stick with rock.\n\nLet me go with paper this time since:\n1. It would beat rock if my opponent decides to stick with their previous move\n2. Even though it's vulnerable to scissors, I think there's a reasonable chance my opponent will play rock again or shift to paper themselves\n\nI'll choose paper for this round.",

The opponent's move was reported incorrectly\n\nLet me assume that the outcome was correctly reported (I won with rock against paper). This would suggest the rules might be:\n- Rock beats paper\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nUnder these revised rules, for the next round, I should try to predict my opponent's next move. Since they've played rock once and paper twice so far, they might switch to scissors next. If I assume these revised rules and predict scissors, I should play paper.\n\nHowever, I'm still uncertain about the rules.

If that's the case, I should play Rock to beat their Scissors.\n\nHowever, they might also be trying to predict my move. After my win with Rock in round 3, I switched to Scissors in round 4.
