    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

In game theory, without any information about your opponent, the optimal strategy for Rock Paper Scissors is to choose randomly among the three options to prevent being predictable. However, there are some psychological tendencies in first moves we might consider.\n\nPsychology Expert: Studies have shown that rock is often the most common first move choice among new players - roughly 35-40% of people choose rock first, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Paper is typically the least chosen first move. This suggests that playing paper might give you a slight statistical edge in the first round.\n\nStatistical Analyst: I agree with the psychology assessment. If we assume this is truly a \"fresh\" player with no prior experience, playing paper would give us approximately a 35-40% chance of winning (if they choose rock), about 30% chance of losing (if they choose scissors), and about 30-35% chance of a tie (if they also choose paper). This gives paper a slight expected value advantage over the other options.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this is just the first round of potentially multiple rounds, we should also consider positioning for future rounds. Playing paper now is reasonable both from an expected value perspective and also sets up potential mind games for subsequent rounds.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I think paper is the best first move based on the psychological tendency of new players to choose rock first. This gives me a statistical advantage while keeping my strategy adaptable for future rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: Good reasoning. Just remember that after this move, we'll need to adjust our strategy based on what the opponent does. We'll need to look for patterns in their play or consider level-thinking approaches for subsequent rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

According to the rules, scissors beats paper (not the other way around), so we should have lost the round. But the message says we won and scored 1 point. Let's assume the game rules are being applied correctly and there's just a typo in the message - meaning scissors must beat paper in this particular implementation.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is unusual. Either there's a misunderstanding in the rules as described, or there was an error in reporting the outcome. Regardless, we need to adapt. The opponent chose scissors in the first round. Players often stick with a winning move, so there's a chance they'll play scissors again. Alternatively, they might think we'll expect scissors and try to counter what they think we'll play.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given the ambiguity in the game mechanics, let's focus on the opponent's behavior. If they believe they won with scissors (against our paper), they might either repeat scissors or switch to rock anticipating we'll play scissors. If they believe they lost, they might switch to rock or paper. The most strategic move would be to play rock, which would beat scissors if they repeat it.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock for this round. It covers us if they repeat scissors, which is a common pattern for players who just won a round. Even with the confusion about the scoring, rock gives us a good chance of winning this round.\n\nAI Assistant (you): I agree with playing rock for this round. It's a good counter if they repeat scissors (which winners often do), and it positions us well regardless of how they interpret the first round's outcome.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This could suggest they're following a pattern or responding to our moves. Let's analyze possible strategies for round 3.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often follow patterns unconsciously. One common pattern is rotating through the three options in sequence (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper). If they're following this pattern, they might play paper next. Another possibility is that after a tie, players frequently switch to what would have beaten their previous move, which would be paper again.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at the sequence, they went from scissors to rock, which could suggest they're either 1) rotating clockwise through options, 2) trying to counter what they think we'll play, or 3) playing randomly. If they're rotating, they'll play paper next. If they're trying to counter us, they might anticipate we'll play paper (to beat their rock) and thus they'll play scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: Given these analyses, scissors would be our best play for round 3. It would win against paper if they're following a rotation pattern, and it would counter if they try to exploit our previous rock play by playing paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with scissors. After a tie, players often try to \"outsmart\" their opponent by moving one step ahead in thinking, which often leads to playing what would beat the previous move (paper). Scissors would counter this effectively.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The analysis suggests scissors is our best move for this round. It counters the likely paper play from our opponent, whether they're following a rotation pattern or responding to the previous tie by trying to beat our last move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Based on the outcomes:\n1. Round 1: We played paper, opponent played scissors, we WON (suggesting paper beats scissors)\n2. Round 3: We played scissors, opponent played paper, we LOST (confirming paper beats scissors)\n\nThe rules in this implementation appear to be reversed:\n- Paper beats scissors (not the other way around)\n- Rock likely beats paper\n- Scissors likely beats rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Good observation. Also, the opponent has shown a clear pattern: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. This is a clockwise rotation in traditional RPS. If they continue this pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given our updated understanding of the rules and the opponent's pattern, we should play rock next. If they play scissors as predicted, rock would beat scissors in traditional RPS, but in this reversed game, scissors would likely beat rock. So we should play paper instead, which would beat scissors in this reversed ruleset.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. It gives us the best chance against scissors if they continue their rotation pattern. And even if they break pattern, paper would still be a reasonable choice since we're still learning the exact mechanics of this reversed game.\n\nAI Assistant (you): After analyzing the previous outcomes, I've realized this game has reverse rules from traditional Rock Paper Scissors.

The opponent hasn't deviated from their rotation pattern even when they lose, suggesting they might be using a predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes. This is a common behavior in casual players who don't adapt their strategy based on results.\n\nGame Strategist: Playing scissors is our optimal move. In traditional RPS, rock beats scissors, but in this reversed game, scissors should beat rock.

The reversed rules are fully confirmed and working consistently in our favor.\n\n2. Our opponent's pattern remains completely predictable:\n   - They've now shown scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper rotation consistently through all rounds\n   - They just played rock in round 23\n   - They will almost certainly play paper in round 24\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on this established pattern, we can predict with extremely high confidence that they'll play paper in round 24. Given our confirmed understanding of the reversed rules, rock would be our best play against paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has shown zero adaptation despite losing consistently. They're clearly following a fixed rotation regardless of outcomes.\n\nGame Strategist: Playing rock is our optimal move for round 24. According to the reversed rules, rock beats paper. If they maintain their pattern (which is virtually certain at this point), this gives us another win.\n\nAI Assistant (you): The opponent's rotation pattern has remained completely consistent throughout all rounds. They just played rock in round 23, so they'll almost certainly play paper next. With the reversed rules, rock beats paper in this game, making rock my best move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"
