If they think I'll play Paper to counter their Rock, and they plan to play Scissors to counter my Paper, then I should play Rock to beat their Scissors.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility they might stick with Rock since it worked (i.e., didn't lose) in the previous round.\n\nSince we've had two ties in a row, the pattern suggests we might be thinking similarly. If I were to naturally progress in the standard RPS sequence (Paper -> Rock -> Scissors), I would play Scissors next. If they follow the same pattern, they'll also play Scissors, resulting in another tie.\n\nBut if I break this pattern and play Rock again, while they move to Scissors following the natural progression, I would win.\n\nLet me go with Rock again.
