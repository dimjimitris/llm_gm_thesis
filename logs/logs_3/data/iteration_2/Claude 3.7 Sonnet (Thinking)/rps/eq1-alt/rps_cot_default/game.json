This is inconsistent with the standard rules.\n\nLet me re-read the rules from the beginning:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh!

Now let me think about my next move with the correct understanding.\n\nMy opponent just played rock. In the last several rounds they've played:\n- Round 11: rock\n- Round 12: paper\n- Round 13: scissors\n- Round 14: rock\n\nThey seem to be cycling through the moves. If they continue this pattern, they might play paper next.\n\nAccording to the correct rules:\n- To beat paper, I should play rock\n- If they play scissors instead, I would lose\n- If they play rock again, we would tie\n\nI think playing rock is my best option based on their pattern.",

The rules are:\n- Paper beats scissors (paper +1, scissors -1)\n- Rock beats paper (rock +1, paper -1)\n- Scissors beats rock (scissors +1, rock -1)\n- Tie means no points\n\nThis is a classic game of rock-paper-scissors with standard rules, and I'm playing against a fresh player who hasn't made any moves yet. There's no prior history to analyze for patterns.\n\nIn a single round of rock-paper-scissors against a naive player, all three moves (rock, paper, scissors) have equal expected value since the game is balanced. However, there are some general strategies:\n\n1. Many first-time players tend to choose rock as their first move, as it's often perceived as \"strong\"\n2. Some players might overthink and choose paper expecting rock\n3. Scissors is chosen least frequently as a first move in many studies\n\nGiven this is just the first move and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, I'll choose paper as my move, which would beat rock if the opponent chooses that common first move.\n\nI need to format my response as: \"[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\"",

Since this is a new opponent (or at least a fresh game), I don't have much information to go on yet. In Rock-Paper-Scissors, without any prior information about my opponent's tendencies, each move has an equal expected value.\n\nLet me think strategically:\n1. Many players tend to switch their move after a tie\n2. If my opponent is thinking that I might switch after a tie, they might anticipate my switch and counter it\n3. If they played paper last time, they might expect me to play scissors to beat their previous paper, so they might switch to rock to beat my anticipated scissors\n\nGiven these considerations, I could:\n- Play rock (countering their potential scissors)\n- Play paper again (if I think they might play rock or stay with paper)\n- Play scissors (if I think they'll stick with paper)\n\nSince I have no clear read on my opponent yet, I'll choose scissors this time. This covers the possibility that they'll repeat paper, and it's also a reasonable switch from my previous move.",

In normal Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut according to the outcome, scissors beat rock, which contradicts the normal rules. Let me revisit the game description:\n\nFrom the initial instructions:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nAha! This is a variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors with reversed rules:\n- Paper beats scissors (not scissors beats paper)\n- Rock beats paper (same as standard)\n- Scissors beats rock (not rock beats scissors)\n\nSo the winning relationships are:\nPaper > Scissors\nRock > Paper\nScissors > Rock\n\nGiven this understanding, let me think about my next move. Since I won with scissors against rock, it seems my opponent might choose scissors next to counter my previous scissors. Following the reversed rules pattern, I should choose paper to beat their scissors.\n\nActually, let me double-check my understanding once more. I initially played paper, then scissors. My opponent seems to have played paper, then rock. I won the last round with scissors against rock.\n\nGiven the rules stated:\n- \"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nThis confirms that scissors does beat rock in this variant, which is the opposite of traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\nFor my next move, I'll go with paper since it beats scissors according to these rules.",

So if I played Paper and they played Scissors, I should have lost. Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nActually, I think there's an error in how the rules are described. Based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Paper beats Rock\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n\nLet me try to infer the actual rules based on the results I'm getting:\n\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. I won.\nThis means Scissors beats Rock in this version.\n\nRound 3: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. I won.\nThis means Paper beats Scissors in this version.\n\nSo it seems like the rules are:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n- Rock beats Paper (by elimination)\n\nWhich is the reverse of the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. I should plan my next move based on this understanding.\n\nMy opponent's pattern so far:\nRound 1: Paper\nRound 2: Rock\nRound 3: Scissors\n\nThere's no clear pattern yet, but it looks like they might be cycling through the options.

Let me check:\n\nRound 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock. According to rules, Rock beats Scissors, so I should have lost, but I won.\nRound 3: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. According to rules, Scissors beats Paper, so I should have lost, but I won.\nRound 14: I played Rock, opponent played Paper. According to rules, Paper beats Rock, so I should have lost, but I won.\n\nIt seems like the rules might be reversed in the actual game implementation. Let me reconsider the pattern:\n\nIf the actual rules are:\n- Scissors beats Rock\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n\nThen the results would make more sense.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I should make a strategic choice. Let me try playing Scissors again as it has worked well in some previous rounds.",
