    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This prevents exploitation by the opponent.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: First-time players often choose rock slightly more frequently than the other options. Studies show roughly 35% of initial moves are rock, as people associate it with strength. However, since the opponent might be strategic, we shouldn't rely too heavily on this tendency.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this is the first move with no prior information, we should balance between exploiting potential biases while not being too predictable ourselves. We should consider what move counters the statistically most common first move.\n\nProbability Expert: If rock is statistically more common as a first move, playing paper would give us a slight edge. However, if the opponent anticipates this reasoning, they might play scissors instead.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's not overthink this first move. While we could try to exploit potential biases, in the absence of any history or pattern, a balanced approach is reasonable. Paper is a decent choice given the slight bias toward rock in first-time players.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Let's go with paper for this first move, which exploits the most common tendency while not being overly risky.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

This could mean they applied similar reasoning to us (expecting rock as a common first move). Let's consider what they might do next.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players often change their move rather than repeat the same one. The opponent might expect us to shift as well. There's a psychological tendency to shift to the move that would have beaten the previous move - in this case, scissors to beat paper.\n\nDecision Strategist: We have two main strategies to consider:\n1. Counter what we believe the opponent will play next\n2. Stick with paper, assuming they might overthink and return to rock\n\nProbability Expert: If we assume the opponent will likely shift away from paper (as most players do after a tie), they'll choose either rock or scissors. If they follow the common pattern of shifting to what would have beaten the previous move, they'll choose scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, our best counter would be rock, which beats scissors. However, if they anticipate our reasoning and stay with paper or shift to rock, our rock move would lose or tie.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's another consideration - some players use \"rotation patterns\" in rock-paper-scissors, moving from paper to scissors to rock in sequence. If the opponent follows this common rotation, they'll move from paper to scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Weighing all these factors, rock seems to be our strongest move for this round. It counters the most likely move from the opponent (scissors) based on psychological tendencies after ties.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Let's go with rock for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

First both played paper, then both played rock. This suggests the opponent may be using similar reasoning patterns to ours.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After two consecutive ties, players often feel stronger pressure to \"win\" the next round. The natural progression from rock would be to play paper (following the rotation pattern of rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors). However, if the opponent thinks we're thinking the same way, they might skip to scissors to beat our anticipated paper.\n\nProbability Expert: We should consider what appears to be happening. Either: 1) The opponent is independently reaching the same conclusions as us, 2) They're deliberately matching our moves, or 3) This is coincidence. After two ties, the psychological pressure to break the tie increases.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the likely scenarios:\n1. If they continue the natural rotation from rock, they'll play paper\n2. If they're trying to anticipate our move and think we'll play paper, they might play scissors\n3. If they think we might overthink this, they could stick with rock\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, we need to counter their most likely move. If they follow the natural progression from rock to paper, our best move would be scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: There's also the pattern-breaking psychology to consider. After two ties, there's often an urge to \"break out\" of the pattern. If they think we'll play scissors (the counter to their expected paper), they might play rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: This is getting complex with multiple layers of thinking. Let's not overthink. I believe scissors is our best option here - it beats the most natural progression (paper) and breaks our own pattern.\n\nProbability Expert: Agreed. Scissors gives us the best chance to win this round based on the observed pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We've been operating under incorrect assumptions about the game mechanics. With the correct rule understanding, let's reassess our strategy.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The opponent has now played paper twice and rock once. They just won with paper against our scissors.

They might be developing a psychological advantage and could be thinking one step ahead of us.\n\nProbability Expert: Their pattern doesn't show any immediate repetition after a win. After winning with paper, they switched to scissors. This suggests they might not play scissors again immediately.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to break this losing streak.

It would:\n- Beat rock if they switch to it\n- Tie if they also play paper\n- Lose to scissors, but scissors would be a third consecutive different move, which is less likely\n\nProbability Expert: Agreed.

They're most likely to switch to rock to counter our paper, which has been our only winning move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. After consecutive losses with the same move, players typically make a significant strategy shift. They'll likely expect us to continue with paper and will counter accordingly.\n\nDecision Strategist: In this case, scissors would be risky.

Overall they've played scissors 4 times, paper 3 times, and rock twice.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After a tie, players typically want to break the pattern and seek a win. There's a tendency to shift to what would have beaten the previous move - in this case, paper to beat rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze their possible moves after this tie:\n1. They play paper to beat our rock (fairly likely based on psychological patterns)\n2. They anticipate we'll switch to paper and play scissors to counter (also possible)\n3. They stick with rock, thinking we might overthink and play scissors (less likely)\n\nGame Theorist: They've shown adaptability and intelligence in their play. After the tie, they're likely thinking about what we'll play next. If they expect us to play paper (the natural counter to rock), they might play scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: However, after consecutive ties (rounds 1 and 2, and now round 9), they've historically switched to paper. They seem to favor paper after ties or as a strategy shift.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this pattern and their adaptability, scissors would be our best move here. It would:\n- Beat paper if they follow their historical pattern after ties\n- Lose to rock if they stick with it\n- Tie with scissors if they try to counter our anticipated paper\n\nProbability Expert: Considering all factors, scissors gives us the highest probability of success in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

They've played scissors 4 times, rock 3 times, and paper 3 times overall.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing, players typically change their strategy. They just lost with rock against our scissors, so they're likely to move away from rock. Given the history of the game, they might expect us to play paper next (to beat their rock) and could switch to scissors to counter that.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's consider their possible moves:\n1. They switch to paper to beat our expected scissors (fairly likely)\n2. They switch to scissors anticipating we'll play paper (also possible)\n3. They stick with rock despite losing (less likely)\n\nGame Theorist: They've shown adaptability throughout the game. After losses, they typically change their move. Since they just lost with rock, they'll likely switch to either paper or scissors.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The most common psychological pattern after a loss is to switch to what would have beaten the opponent's winning move. Since our scissors beat their rock, they might play paper to counter scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given these considerations, I believe rock is our best move for this round. It would:\n- Beat paper if they follow the most likely psychological pattern\n- Lose to scissors if they anticipate our switch\n- Tie with rock if they stick with it (less likely)\n\nProbability Expert: Based on their previous adaptations after losses and the overall game dynamics, rock gives us the highest probability of success in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

They just lost with scissors against our paper, and interestingly, they've played scissors twice in a row again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: After losing with scissors twice in their last three moves, they're likely to switch strategies. Players rarely stick with a move that's repeatedly failing, especially when they just lost again.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. Their most recent pattern is rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n2. Throughout the game, after losing with scissors against paper, they've typically switched to either paper or rock\n3. They might anticipate we'll play paper again since it just won\n\nGame Theorist: Given their adaptability shown throughout the game, they're likely to switch to either paper (to beat our expected scissors) or rock (to beat our expected paper).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: The psychological pattern after consecutive losses with the same move is to make a decisive change. Given the unusual rules where paper beats scissors, they might switch to paper to counter our expected scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given these considerations, scissors seems to be our best move. It would:\n- Beat paper if they switch to it as expected\n- Lose to rock if they anticipate we'll play scissors\n- Tie with scissors if they unexpectedly stick with it\n\nProbability Expert: Based on their tendency to switch after losses and their overall game patterns, scissors gives us the highest probability of success in this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at how this opponent has behaved after previous ties:\n- After the paper tie in Round 1, they played rock\n- After the rock tie in Round 2, they played paper\n- After the rock tie in Round 9, they played rock again\n\nSo there's no clear pattern after ties, but they tend not to repeat the same move.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze their possible moves:\n1.

After ties, there's psychological pressure to \"win\" the next round.
