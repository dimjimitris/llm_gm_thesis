    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Without any data on my opponent, all three options (rock, paper, scissors) have equal strategic value.\n3.

Given this common tendency, playing paper would be a reasonable counter-strategy.\n5. The optimal strategy in repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors is to be unpredictable, but having a slight edge in the first round could be beneficial.\n6.

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\n   - Round 15: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n\n2. My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n3. I just won with paper against rock, which is my fourth win in the game\n\n4. Looking at their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, I see a potential rotation pattern\n\n5. If they continue this apparent rotation, they might play scissors next\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After Round 6 (my win), they played paper\n   - After Round 14 (my win), they played scissors\n   - After Round 17 (my win), they played rock\n   - There's no consistent pattern in how they respond after losing\n\n7. After I've won with paper previously, they've never played paper in the next round\n\n8. Given the apparent rotation in their recent moves and the likelihood they'll try to counter my expected move, rock would be the optimal choice\n\n[move] rock"

I just won with rock against their scissors, which is my fifth win\n\n4. Their recent moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) broke their previous apparent pattern\n\n5. Looking at what they tend to play after I've played rock:\n   - They've countered with paper 4 times\n   - They've played rock (tie) 2 times\n   - They've played scissors 1 time (just now)\n\n6. After I've won, they have no consistent response pattern, but they rarely repeat their losing move\n\n7. Given their history of frequently countering rock with paper, they might expect me to play rock again after my success\n\n8. Scissors would beat their anticipated paper play, while only losing if they switch to rock\n\n[move] scissors"

I just won with scissors against their paper, marking my third consecutive win\n\n4. Their last three moves have formed a cycle: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n5. After consecutive losses, players typically break patterns and make strategic shifts\n\n6. Since I've won with three different moves in a row (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors), they might expect me to start a new pattern\n\n7. Rock has been their most frequent choice throughout the game (11/23 rounds) and would counter my recent scissors success\n\n8. Given the emerging patterns and their likely need to break my winning streak, paper would be the optimal choice\n\n[move] paper"
