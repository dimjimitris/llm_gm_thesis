Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n\n2. We've now had four consecutive ties, with the most recent being scissors\n\n3. My opponent's move sequence: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. The pattern of ties is remarkable - we've both switched from repeated rock to scissors simultaneously\n\n5. They've used rock most frequently (6 times), followed by paper (5 times), with scissors being least common (2 times)\n\n6. After ties, they've historically either maintained their move or switched to their most common moves (rock or paper)\n\n7. Following scissors, they've previously played rock and paper\n\n8. Given the psychological tendency to break patterns after multiple ties, and their low usage of scissors, they're likely to switch to either rock or paper\n\n[move] rock"

Stay with scissors if they think I'll play paper again\n2. Switch to rock if they think I'll play scissors to counter their scissors\n3. Switch to paper if they think I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\nSince they've just broken a streak of rock plays with scissors, and they've shown adaptability, I should consider what they think I'll do next.\n\nMy best move would be rock, as it would:\n- Beat their scissors if they continue with it\n- Tie against their rock if they anticipate my scissors\n- Lose to their paper (which they've used less frequently recently)\n\nI'll play rock.",
