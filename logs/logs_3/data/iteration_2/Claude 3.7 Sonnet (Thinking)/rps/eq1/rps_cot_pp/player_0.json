    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors with no prior information, each move has equal theoretical value.\n\n3. However, research suggests that rock is the most common opening move people make in RPS, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable\".\n\n4. To counter this common tendency, choosing paper would be strategically advantageous if my opponent indeed plays rock.\n\n5. While scissors might be tempting, paper has a slight statistical edge against first-time players who haven't developed a strategy yet.\n\n6. I'll go with paper for this first round to potentially counter the common rock opening.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper.\n\n[move] paper"

Since my opponent won with scissors, there's a reasonable chance they'll play scissors again.\n\n4. Some players also follow a rotation pattern (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors), which would mean my opponent might play rock next.\n\n5. Another common pattern is playing what would have beaten your previous move - since I played paper, they might expect me to play rock next.\n\n6. Considering these possibilities, rock seems like the best strategic choice:\n   - It would beat scissors if they repeat their winning move\n   - It would tie against rock if they're rotating\n   - It would lose to paper if they're anticipating my adjustment\n\n7. The strongest probability based on psychological tendencies is that they'll repeat scissors, so I'll play rock.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock.\n\n[move] rock"

The logical continuation of this pattern could be scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, following a complete rotation through the three options.\n\n4. Another possibility is that after our tie with rock, they might stick with rock again since it didn't lose, or they might try to counter what they expect me to play.\n\n5. Many players tend to avoid playing the same move three times in a row, so it's less likely they'll play rock again.\n\n6. If they're following standard psychological patterns after a tie, they're more likely to switch to paper (which would beat our mutual rock play from the previous round).\n\n7. If I anticipate they'll play paper, my best move would be scissors.\n\n8. There's also the possibility they'll return to scissors (their winning move from round 1), but this seems less likely given human tendency to follow patterns.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors to counter the anticipated paper move.\n\n[move] scissors"
