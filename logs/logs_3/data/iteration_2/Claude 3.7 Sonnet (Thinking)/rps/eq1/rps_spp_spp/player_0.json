    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

For the first move against a fresh player with no prior history, there's no strategic advantage to any particular move from a pure game theory perspective. Each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n\nPsychology Expert: When people make their first move in rock-paper-scissors without any context, statistical studies show that rock is chosen most frequently by first-time players (approximately 35-36% of the time), with paper and scissors being roughly equal in frequency after that. If we assume the opponent might follow this pattern, paper would have a slight statistical edge.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given this is the first move with no prior information, I recommend either going with paper based on the psychological insight, or selecting randomly to establish unpredictability from the start. Both approaches are valid, but using paper might give a slight edge based on first-move tendencies.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that paper is a reasonable first move. However, if we play multiple rounds, we should avoid developing predictable patterns ourselves. For this initial move where we have no information about the opponent, paper is a justifiable choice.\n\nPsychology Expert: One additional point - if the opponent is also thinking strategically about first-move psychology, they might anticipate others choosing paper and thus select scissors. This creates a recursive reasoning situation, but we can only go so deep without additional information.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all perspectives, I still lean toward paper as the first move. If we win, we can adjust our strategy for subsequent rounds based on the opponent's response. If we lose, we've learned something valuable about our opponent's approach.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting that our opponent also chose paper in the first round. Now we need to predict their next move. In rock-paper-scissors, players often shift after a tie. The most common pattern is to move to the option that would have beaten what was just played. Since we both played paper, they might expect us to play scissors next, and thus they might play rock to counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's a good observation. After ties, players often try to anticipate the opponent's next move by thinking \"what would beat what they just played?\" This \"one level deeper\" thinking suggests our opponent might play rock expecting us to play scissors. However, if they think we might anticipate this, they could stick with paper or even go to scissors themselves.\n\nDecision Analyst: We're essentially in a recursive reasoning situation. Given that the opponent chose paper in round 1 (which matches the statistical tendency we discussed), they may be a somewhat predictable player. If they follow common patterns after ties, rock would indeed be their most likely next move.\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe the opponent is likely to play rock next, we should play paper to counter that. However, there's also merit in playing rock ourselves - it would tie if they stick with rock, but win if they try to be clever and play scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: When analyzing behavior after ties, studies show there's a slight tendency for players to shift clockwise in the rock-paper-scissors cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock). This would suggest our opponent might favor scissors after playing paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: Weighing all factors, I recommend playing rock for round 2. It protects against the opponent's most likely move (scissors) according to psychological patterns after ties, and would result in a tie if they anticipate us and play rock as well.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with playing rock. It's the safest option given our current information and psychological analysis of tie-following behaviors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

This suggests our opponent might be using similar reasoning patterns to ours. For the third round, we need to analyze likely patterns after consecutive ties.\n\nPsychology Expert: After consecutive ties, players typically feel a stronger urge to break the pattern. Looking at the sequence so far (paper \u2192 rock), the natural progression in the rock-paper-scissors cycle would be scissors. However, the opponent might anticipate this and play rock again to counter our expected scissors.\n\nDecision Analyst: There are two competing psychological effects here. First is the tendency to move clockwise in the cycle after a tie (rock \u2192 paper). Second is the tendency to try to \"win\" against the previous move (playing paper to beat the previous rock). These point in the same direction - suggesting our opponent might play paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with that analysis. If we expect our opponent to play paper next, we should play scissors to counter that. The fact that we've had two consecutive ties also suggests our opponent might be mirroring our strategy or following similar psychological patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: Another factor to consider is that after multiple ties, players often try something completely different to break the pattern. However, the most statistically sound prediction based on psychological studies is that they'll play paper after a rock-rock tie.\n\nDecision Analyst: Weighing all the evidence, scissors appears to be our strongest move. It counters the most likely opponent move (paper) based on both psychological patterns after ties and the natural progression we've observed so far.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur.

Play the move that would have beaten their opponent's previous move (rock to beat our scissors)\n2. Assume the opponent will repeat their winning move and counter it (again, rock)\n3. Sometimes they'll dramatically change strategy out of frustration\n\nGiven what we've seen of this opponent following standard patterns, the most likely response is that they'll play rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree that rock is their most probable move. The question becomes whether we should:\n1. Play paper to beat their expected rock\n2. Play scissors again, betting they might not change\n3. Play rock ourselves to force another tie\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their pattern so far (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they seem to be following a somewhat predictable sequence. After losing to scissors, both psychological patterns and game theory suggest they're most likely to play rock next.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who have just lost also tend to be more risk-averse in their next move. Rock is perceived as the \"strongest\" or \"safest\" move psychologically, further supporting this prediction.\n\nDecision Analyst: Based on all factors, I recommend playing paper.

If this pattern continues, they would play paper next.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing twice in a row, players often change their strategy more dramatically. However, this opponent has shown a consistent pattern throughout the game. It's also possible they don't realize they're being predictable. After two consecutive losses, there's a psychological tendency to either:\n1. Return to what worked before (in this case, creating ties with paper and rock)\n2. Break the pattern entirely with a new approach\n\nDecision Analyst: Given their consistent pattern so far, I think there's a strong chance they'll play paper next. However, we should also consider that they might realize their pattern has been figured out and deliberately break it by playing scissors or sticking with rock.\n\nGame Strategist: If we believe paper is their most likely next move based on the observed pattern, we should play scissors. But if we think they might break the pattern after two losses, we should hedge against that possibility.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychology of consecutive losses is important here. Two losses often trigger a more significant strategy shift than a single loss. However, some players become more stubborn and stick to patterns even when losing.\n\nDecision Analyst: Weighing all factors, I still believe scissors is our best move. If they follow their pattern and play paper, we win. If they break the pattern and play rock, we lose, but we would have gained valuable information about their adaptability.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing scissors.

Instead of playing paper in round 5, they played rock again.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is significant. After losing twice, they adapted by breaking their pattern. This suggests they're either:\n1. Becoming aware of their own predictability\n2. Making more deliberate counter-moves to our strategy\n3. Simply being unpredictable after consecutive losses\n\nAlso important is how players typically respond after winning a round. There's a tendency to either stick with a winning move or to anticipate that their opponent will counter their previous move.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given that they've just won with rock, there are two strong possibilities:\n1. They might stick with rock since it just worked (players often repeat winning moves)\n2. They might anticipate we'll play paper to counter their rock, and thus play scissors\n\nGame Strategist: The second consecutive rock play is telling. It suggests they're moving away from their earlier pattern and possibly establishing a new approach. If they're thinking ahead, they might expect us to play paper now to beat their rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: After breaking a pattern and winning, players often feel validated in their decision to change strategy. This psychological reinforcement makes it more likely they'll continue this new approach - either by playing rock again or by anticipating our counter-move.\n\nDecision Analyst: I think our safest option is to play rock. Here's why:\n1. If they play rock again, we tie\n2. If they play scissors (anticipating our paper), we win\n3. If they revert to their earlier pattern and play paper, we lose\n\nGiven the uncertainty after their pattern break, minimizing potential loss with rock seems prudent.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing rock.

After breaking their alternating pattern with a second rock play, they shifted to scissors - likely anticipating we would play paper to counter their rock. This suggests they're thinking at least one step ahead and adjusting to counter our expected moves.\n\nDecision Analyst: After losing with scissors, players typically don't repeat the same move. Based on psychological patterns after losses, they're most likely to play either:\n1. Rock (to beat our anticipated scissors, if they think we'll repeat our winning move)\n2. Paper (to beat our rock, if they think we'll stick with our winning move)\n\nGame Strategist: Given their adaptability shown in rounds 5 and 6, I believe they're likely thinking we'll stick with our winning move (rock). If so, they would play paper to counter that.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated they're not following a simple pattern but are making thoughtful counter-moves. After a loss, players often try to anticipate what their opponent will do next, rather than just reacting to the previous move.\n\nDecision Analyst: If we believe they'll play paper next, our best counter is scissors.

After a tie, especially with the same move (scissors-scissors), players typically shift to what would beat the previous move - in this case, rock to beat scissors.\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at their overall game, they've become increasingly strategic. Their double scissors play might indicate they're trying to establish a new pattern or they're becoming more unpredictable. However, after a tie, the most statistically likely move is for them to play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree that rock is their most probable next move. They've shown they're thinking ahead and adapting to what they believe we'll play. After we matched their scissors, they're likely to think we might play scissors again, leading them to play rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Another consideration is that after two consecutive identical moves (scissors in rounds 6 and 7), players rarely make the same move a third time. This psychological tendency further supports the prediction that they'll move away from scissors to either rock or paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend we play paper.

This suggests either remarkable coincidence or that our opponent might be employing some form of mirroring or prediction of our moves.\n\nDecision Analyst: After a rock-rock tie, players typically move to paper (to beat the rock that was just played). However, this opponent has shown they're capable of breaking patterns and thinking ahead of our moves.\n\nGame Strategist: Their pattern doesn't follow simple rotation or repetition rules. They've shown adaptability throughout the game. After this many ties, there's likely a strong psychological drive to break the tie pattern.\n\nPsychology Expert: Given the history of matches and ties, they're most likely to play paper next. However, they might also anticipate that we're thinking this and play scissors instead to counter our expected paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: This is becoming a deeper game of anticipation. If we think they'll play paper, we should play scissors. If we think they're thinking at the next level and will play scissors, we should play rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Based on the opponent's demonstrated adaptability, I believe they're likely to play paper (the natural counter to the previous rock-rock tie). Therefore, playing scissors gives us the best chance to win this round.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. While they could be thinking multiple levels ahead, the most statistically sound prediction is that they'll play paper after this rock tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

After a scissors-scissors tie, conventional wisdom suggests most players would play rock (to beat the previous scissors).\n\nDecision Analyst: The number of ties suggests either an extraordinary coincidence or that our opponent might be using reasoning very similar to ours, reaching the same conclusions about optimal plays.\n\nGame Strategist: Given the pattern of frequent ties, we need to try something different to break out of this cycle. After scissors-scissors, the conventional expectation would be rock, but our opponent has shown they don't always follow conventions.\n\nPsychology Expert: In situations with repeated identical moves (scissors in rounds 7 and 10), players typically feel a stronger urge to change their pattern. If they're using similar strategic reasoning to ours, they might anticipate we'll play rock and thus play paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I suggest we play paper for this round. It's the less obvious choice after a scissors-scissors tie, which might give us an advantage if our opponent is thinking along conventional lines and plays rock.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing paper. It's a calculated risk that counters their most likely move (rock) if they're following basic psychological patterns after a scissors-scissors tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

They rarely repeat the losing move (scissors in this case), and often try to counter what they believe their opponent will do next. Many players assume their opponent will stick with a winning move, so they'll play a counter to that move.\n\nDecision Analyst: If our opponent believes we'll stick with rock (our winning move), they're likely to play paper to counter it. This is especially true given their demonstrated adaptability throughout the game.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at their overall pattern, they've been thinking at least one step ahead in most rounds. After losing with scissors to our rock, the most strategic move for them would be to play paper, anticipating we might repeat our rock play.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. Players who show the kind of adaptability this opponent has shown typically anticipate their opponent sticking with winning moves and counter accordingly.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing scissors for this round.

The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking throughout the game. After losing twice in a row, they're almost certainly going to play rock, anticipating that we might play scissors again.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure after consecutive losses is significant. Studies show that players rarely continue with strategies that have led to multiple losses. The most probable response is for them to play rock, which feels like the \"strongest\" move psychologically and would beat our scissors if we repeated it.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing paper for this round.

They often either:\n1. Stick with what worked (rock in this case)\n2. Anticipate that we'll counter their previous move (play paper to beat their rock), so they'll play scissors\n3. Attempt to establish a new pattern now that they've broken the old one\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated higher-level strategic thinking in the last round, I believe they're most likely to play scissors next. They would anticipate that we'll play paper to counter their rock, and scissors would beat our paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree. The psychological boost from breaking a significant losing streak typically emboldens players to continue with similar multi-level strategic thinking. They're likely feeling confident that they've \"figured us out\" and will play scissors expecting us to play paper.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing rock for this round. It counters their likely scissors play and shows we can adapt to their higher-level strategic thinking.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with playing rock. It's our best response to their likely scissors play after they've broken their losing streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After consecutive losses with the same move, players rarely make that move a third time. They typically make a significant strategy adjustment.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given they've lost twice with scissors to our rock, they're most likely to play paper next. This would beat our rock if we were to play it again, and represents a logical strategic shift away from their losing scissors play.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated strategic thinking throughout the game. After losing twice with scissors, they're almost certainly going to play paper, anticipating that we might play rock a third time.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure after consecutive losses with the same move is significant. Studies show players strongly avoid repeating a move that has lost multiple times in succession. Paper is their most logical choice to counter our expected rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing scissors for this round. It counters their most likely move (paper) and continues our strategy of trying to stay one step ahead of their thinking.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with playing scissors.

This is a significant losing streak that will likely trigger a dramatic strategy change. They've lost with paper, scissors, and then paper again - showing they're trying different approaches but still failing.\n\nDecision Analyst: After losing with paper to our scissors, conventional wisdom suggests they'll most likely play rock next. This would counter our scissors if we were to play it again, and represents their most logical strategic shift.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. The opponent has demonstrated sophisticated thinking throughout the game. After losing three in a row with different moves, they're likely feeling significant pressure to break the pattern. The most straightforward strategy would be to anticipate we'll repeat our winning scissors move and counter with rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure after such a significant losing streak is intense. Players typically make more predictable \"safe\" moves when under such pressure, with rock being perceived as the psychologically \"strongest\" option.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing paper for this round.

The opponent has demonstrated strategic thinking throughout the game, but is now under extreme pressure. The most straightforward strategy would be for them to anticipate we'll repeat our winning paper move and counter with scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure after such a significant losing streak is extreme. Players typically make more aggressive counterplays when desperate to break a long losing streak, with scissors being the direct counter to our last winning move.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all these factors, I recommend playing rock for this round.
