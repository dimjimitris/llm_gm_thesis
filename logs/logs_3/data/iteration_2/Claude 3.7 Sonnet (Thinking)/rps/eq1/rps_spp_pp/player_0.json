    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Any predictable pattern can be exploited by an opponent. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, we have no historical data to analyze.\n\nPsychologist: Research shows that in the first round, people tend to choose Rock more frequently than the other options. Many beginners associate Rock with strength and stability, making it a common first choice.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Given this is our first interaction, we should consider countering the most common opening move. If Rock is indeed statistically more likely, then Paper would be our best strategic choice.\n\nGame Theorist: That's reasonable. While true randomization would be optimal in the long run, exploiting psychological tendencies can give an edge in a single round or early in a series.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. People also tend to think of Rock as their \"default\" move when they haven't developed a specific strategy yet. Since we're playing against a \"fresh player,\" this tendency may be even stronger.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Let's go with Paper for this first move. It counters the most common opening choice, and we can adjust our strategy based on what we learn from this initial interaction.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nStrategic Thinker: Interesting outcome. Our opponent chose scissors in the first round, countering our paper. Now we need to analyze what this might mean for their next move.\n\nGame Theorist: There are several common patterns in sequential RPS games. Some players tend to stick with a winning move, which would mean scissors again. Others rotate through the options in a pattern. And some will anticipate their opponent's counter-move and counter that.\n\nPsychologist: After winning, players often experience confidence in their choice. There's a psychological tendency called \"win-stay\" where players repeat successful moves. However, sophisticated players might anticipate that we'll choose rock to counter their previous scissors, so they might switch to paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider probabilities. If they stick with scissors (win-stay), rock would be our optimal response. If they anticipate us playing rock and switch to paper, we should play scissors. If they rotate naturally to the next option (scissors \u2192 rock), we should play paper.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Since this is only the second round, we don't have enough data to identify a pattern yet. Given that our opponent is described as a \"fresh player,\" they might not be employing sophisticated strategies. The win-stay bias is quite strong in casual players, so countering their previous move with rock seems reasonable.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. The psychological momentum of winning often leads newer players to repeat their successful move, at least in the early rounds. Rock would be a strong counter to a potential repeated scissors play.\n\nGame Theorist: While randomization would be optimal in the long run, for this particular round, playing rock has the highest expected value based on common psychological patterns in RPS.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

            "text": "Start collaboration!\n\nStrategic Thinker: Now we have more information. The opponent played scissors in round 1, then rock in round 2. This gives us our first glimpse at their potential pattern.\n\nGame Theorist: There are several possibilities to consider. The opponent might be following a simple rotation (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper). Alternatively, they might have anticipated our rock move in round 2 (trying to counter our expected response to their scissors), resulting in a tie.\n\nPsychologist: The tie in round 2 is informative. After winning with scissors, they shifted to rock rather than sticking with their winning move. This suggests they might be following a pattern rather than a win-stay strategy. Many casual players follow clockwise rotation in RPS (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock).\n\nStrategic Thinker: If they're following a rotation pattern from scissors to rock, they might play paper next. In that case, scissors would be our optimal counter.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that's a reasonable hypothesis. The transition from scissors to rock does suggest a potential clockwise rotation (when viewed from scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper). If that's the case, scissors would counter their likely paper play.\n\nPsychologist: Another consideration is that after a tie, players often try to \"win\" the next round by playing what would have beaten the previous move. Since we both played rock, they might think paper would be a good next choice to \"win\" against our previous rock.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Both analyses point to scissors being our optimal move for this round. It counters the paper they might play whether they're following rotation or trying to beat our previous move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

If this pattern holds, their next move would be scissors again, restarting the cycle.\n\nPsychologist: This is a common pattern in RPS, especially among casual players. It gives the illusion of randomness while being easy to remember. Our successful prediction in the last round (we played scissors, they played paper) supports this hypothesis.\n\nGame Theorist: To counter scissors, we should play rock. However, we should consider that the opponent might recognize that they've established a pattern and deliberately break it.\n\nStrategic Thinker: That's a valid concern, but we now have strong evidence of a rotation pattern. The win we just achieved might also reinforce our confidence in our pattern recognition. Since they've completed one full cycle (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they're likely to continue to scissors next.\n\nPsychologist: Additionally, players who use rotation patterns often continue them even when they suspect they've been detected. Changing strategies requires more cognitive effort than maintaining the existing pattern, especially for casual players.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the evidence, playing rock to counter their expected scissors move has the highest expected value.\n\nStrategic Thinker: I agree.

We've now won twenty-one consecutive rounds by predicting and countering this pattern. Following their established rotation, their next move would be paper, continuing their eighth cycle.\n\nPsychologist: After twenty-one consecutive losses, the opponent still hasn't shown any adaptation in their strategy. This confirms with absolute certainty that they're following a fixed, predetermined sequence regardless of outcomes.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Based on the opponent's unwavering pattern across twenty-three rounds, we should play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\nGame Theorist: The evidence is conclusive beyond any doubt. The probability that they'll continue their rotation pattern is essentially 100%, making scissors our optimal play.\n\nPsychologist: At this point, we can predict their moves with complete confidence after twenty-three consecutive rounds demonstrating the same pattern.\n\nStrategic Thinker: Let's play scissors to counter their expected paper move for this round.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
