    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let's analyze the payoff structure:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 points for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 points for rock, -3 for paper\n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 points for scissors, -1 for rock\n- Ties yield 0 points\n\nStrategic Planner: The asymmetry makes this quite different from standard RPS. Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but scissors has the lowest risk (-1). Paper has the highest potential loss (-3) which makes it risky.\n\nPsychology Expert: For the first move against a fresh player, they have no pattern to analyze yet. Many players instinctively choose rock as their first move in RPS games, as research shows rock is the most common opening move (approximately 35% of the time).\n\nGame Theorist: If the opponent plays rock first (which is statistically likely), scissors would be a poor choice (-1 points), while paper would be optimal (-3 points for them, +3 for us).\n\nStrategic Planner: However, if they're strategic, they might anticipate this and choose paper first. In that case, rock would be our best response.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since this is a modified game with different payoffs, the opponent might just play conservatively and choose scissors to minimize potential losses.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at expected values, paper appears to be the safest opening move with the best risk-reward ratio in this specific payoff structure.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

We need to adapt based on this information.\n\nPsychology Expert: Many players tend to stick with a winning move, especially when it gave them a significant advantage. Since rock worked well for them, there's a decent probability they'll play rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: However, a strategic opponent might anticipate that we'll switch to scissors to counter their previous rock move. In that case, they would play paper to beat our scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: We tie if they play rock again; lose 3 points if they play paper; win 1 point if they play scissors\n- If we play paper: We lose 3 points if they play rock again; tie if they play paper; win 1 point if they play scissors\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 point if they play rock again; lose 1 point if they play paper; tie if they play scissors\n\nPattern Analyzer: With only one data point, we can't establish a clear pattern yet. However, rock was clearly effective for them in the first round.\n\nPsychology Expert: Since they had such success with rock (+3 points), there's a psychological tendency to repeat that move. This is known as \"win-stay\" behavior in game theory.\n\nGame Theorist: Given that scissors has the lowest downside risk (-1 if we lose) and could potentially gain us +1 if they repeat rock, scissors might be our best move here.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. Scissors provides the best risk-reward ratio in this situation. If they repeat rock, we gain; if they switch to paper, we only lose 1 point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

There seems to be a potential pattern emerging - they might be cycling through the moves in order: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors.\n\nPsychology Expert: It's also possible they're adapting to what they think we'll play. After winning with rock against our paper, they might have anticipated we'd play scissors to counter their rock, so they played paper.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze what's happened:\n- Round 1: We played paper, they played rock. They won 3 points, we lost 3.\n- Round 2: We played scissors, they played paper. They won 1 point, we lost 1.\n- If they're following a rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern, they'll play scissors next.\n\nStrategic Planner: If we assume they'll play scissors next, our best counter would be rock, which would give us +1 point and them -1.\n\nPsychology Expert: Another possibility is that they're trying to establish a pattern to trick us. They might be expecting us to recognize the pattern and play rock, in which case they might play paper again to win 3 more points.\n\nPattern Analyzer: So far they've won every round. They might be confident and stick with paper since it worked last time.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the limited data and the opponent's success so far, playing rock gives us the best expected value. If they play scissors (following the pattern), we win 1 point. If they repeat paper, we lose 3 points. If they switch to rock, we tie.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree.

Our optimal counter would be paper.\n\nPattern Analyzer: But we should consider that they might be aware we've noticed the pattern. They could break it deliberately to catch us off guard.\n\nGame Theorist: It's also worth noting that they've won with each move in their arsenal now.

We lost 3 points.\n- Round 5: We played rock, they played paper. We won 3 points.\n- Round 6: We played rock, they played scissors. We lost 1 point.\n- Round 7: We played scissors, they played rock. We won 1 point.\n- Round 8: We played rock, they played paper. We won 3 points.\n- Round 9: We played paper, they played scissors. We won 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: Based on the outcomes, let me clarify the rules again:\n- Paper beats scissors: Winner +1, Loser -1\n- Rock beats paper: Winner +3, Loser -3\n- Scissors beats rock: Winner +1, Loser -1\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their sequence of moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\nTheir pattern has remained perfectly consistent through all 9 rounds. They are cycling through rock, paper, scissors in that exact order. Their next move should be rock.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that rock is their likely next move, our optimal counter would be scissors, which would give us +1 point.\n\nPsychology Expert: We've won 4 rounds in a row now. They might finally break their pattern since it's clearly not working for them anymore. However, the extreme consistency suggests this might be a programmed sequence rather than a strategic decision.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play rock (following pattern), scissors would give us +1. If they switch to paper, scissors would lose us 1. If they switch to scissors, we'd tie.\n\nStrategic Planner: Scissors offers the best expected value based on the strong pattern we've observed, especially considering we've won the last 4 rounds following this strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

We won 1 point.\n- Round 11: We played rock, they played scissors. We lost 1 point.\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has finally broken their pattern! After 10 rounds of consistent rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors sequence, they played scissors instead of the expected paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a significant change. After we won 5 consecutive rounds by exploiting their pattern, they've finally adapted. This suggests they're not using a fixed algorithm but are capable of strategic adjustment.\n\nStrategic Planner: Now we need to reassess. They might:\n1. Return to their original pattern (play paper next)\n2. Play randomly to confuse us\n3. Try to anticipate our adjustment to their pattern break\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since they just broke pattern with scissors, they might expect us to adjust by playing paper (which beats scissors in normal RPS, though not in this variant). If they think we'll play paper, they might play scissors again.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play paper: We win against scissors (+1), lose against rock (-3), tie against paper\n- If we play scissors: We win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors\n- If we play rock: We win against paper (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against rock\n\nPsychology Expert: Since they just deviated from pattern, they're likely making a deliberate strategic choice rather than a random move. They might expect us to play paper thinking they'll return to pattern, or scissors to counter their scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this uncertainty, scissors might be our safest bet. It has the lowest downside risk (-1 against rock) while still offering good upside (+1 against paper).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

This could mean several things.\n\nPsychology Expert: They might be returning to their original pattern now. If so, they'd play paper next. Or they could be starting a new pattern from the pattern break. Either way, paper would be their next move if they're using the rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors sequence.\n\nStrategic Planner: We've won 7 out of 12 rounds now, including 6 of the last 8. The opponent has likely realized their pattern was discovered and is attempting to become less predictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at possible scenarios for their next move:\n1. Return to original pattern: they play paper\n2. Continue new sequence from break point: they play paper\n3. Play randomly to confuse us\n4. Use reverse psychology expecting us to overthink\n\nPattern Analyzer: The evidence suggests paper as their most likely next move. Both their established pattern and potential new pattern point to this.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play paper, our best move is rock for +3 points. Even if they play scissors instead, we only lose 1 point with rock. This gives us the best risk-reward ratio.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

After 21 rounds of following the rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors pattern (with only one deviation in round 11), the opponent has finally broken the pattern again by playing rock instead of the expected paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: After we won 10 rounds in a row by predicting their moves, they've finally adapted. This suggests they might be abandoning their pattern strategy altogether.\n\nPattern Analyzer: There are several possibilities now:\n1. This was a one-time deviation and they'll resume their pattern (playing paper next)\n2. They're starting a new pattern\n3. They're switching to random or adaptive play\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's evaluate our options:\n- If we play rock: We tie if they play rock again; lose 3 points if they play paper; win 1 point if they play scissors\n- If we play paper: We lose 3 points if they play rock again; tie if they play paper; win 1 point if they play scissors\n- If we play scissors: We win 1 point if they play rock again; lose 1 point if they play paper; tie if they play scissors\n\nGame Theorist: Given the uncertainty after this pattern break, scissors offers the best risk-reward ratio. The maximum we can lose is 1 point (against paper), while we could gain 1 point against rock. Both other moves have higher potential downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"
