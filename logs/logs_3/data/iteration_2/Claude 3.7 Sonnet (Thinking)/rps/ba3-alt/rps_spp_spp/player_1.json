    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Rock beats paper: +3 points for rock, -3 points for paper\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 point for paper, -1 point for scissors\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 point for scissors, -1 point for rock\n- Same moves: 0 points for both\n\nProbability Analyst: The asymmetric payoffs are key here. Rock has the highest potential gain (+3) but moderate risk (-1). Paper has moderate gain (+1) but highest risk (-3). Scissors has moderate gain (+1) and moderate risk (-1).\n\nPsychology Expert: For a first move against a fresh player, people often choose rock as their initial move due to its perceived strength. If we assume this might be the case, scissors would be risky.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the payoff structure, rock seems to offer the best risk-reward ratio: highest potential gain and only moderate risk. Since this is the first move against a fresh player with no established pattern, maximizing expected value makes sense.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock provides the highest expected value against a random opponent. If they choose paper (which is common as a first move), we lose 3 points. But if they choose scissors, we gain 3 points. If they choose rock, it's a tie.\n\nPsychology Expert: One more consideration: new players might overthink the first move and avoid the obvious rock, potentially favoring paper instead.\n\nDecision Strategist: Weighing all factors, I believe rock is our strongest opening move. It has the highest potential payoff and reasonable risk profile against an unknown opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

I won with rock against paper and scored 3 points. This confirms the unusual payoff structure where rock beats paper, not the traditional RPS rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with paper, the opponent might switch their strategy. Players often avoid repeating a losing move. They might choose rock or scissors this time.\n\nProbability Analyst: Let's consider expected values again. Against the three possible moves:\n- If opponent plays rock: paper gives us +1, scissors gives us +1, rock gives us 0\n- If opponent plays paper: rock gives us +3, paper gives us 0, scissors gives us -1\n- If opponent plays scissors: paper gives us +1, scissors gives us 0, rock gives us -1\n\nDecision Strategist: Paper seems to have the best overall expected value here. It wins against both rock and scissors (though with different payoffs), and only loses to paper (which results in a tie).\n\nPsychology Expert: People often avoid repeating the same move after losing. Since they lost with paper, there's a good chance they'll switch to rock or scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to play rock again since it worked. In that case, they might play scissors to counter.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given all considerations, I recommend playing paper this round. It beats rock (+1) and scissors (+1), and at worst ties with paper (0). This provides good coverage against the likely opponent moves.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

If this pattern continues, they may play rock next.\n\nProbability Analyst: Looking at the pattern and potential moves:\n- If opponent plays rock: paper gives us +1, scissors gives us +1, rock gives us 0\n- If opponent plays paper: rock gives us +3, scissors gives us -1, paper gives us 0\n- If opponent plays scissors: rock gives us -1, paper gives us +1, scissors gives us 0\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the likelihood that they'll play rock next, we should consider paper (gives +1) or scissors (gives +1). Both have equal payoff against rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: However, we should consider that the opponent might recognize they're losing and break their pattern. They might expect us to counter their \"rock\" with paper, so they might play scissors instead.\n\nGame Theorist: There's also the possibility they've noticed the unusual payoff structure of this game and are adjusting accordingly.\n\nDecision Strategist: Since we're dealing with uncertainty and both paper and scissors offer the same payoff (+1) against the expected rock, scissors might be slightly safer. If they play rock, we get +1. If they play paper, we get -1. If they play scissors, we tie at 0.\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree.

The opponent has played paper 3 times, rock 4 times, and scissors 2 times.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is showing increased adaptability. They've won the last three rounds with different moves each time (rock, rock, paper). This suggests they might be better understanding the game mechanics or successfully reading our patterns.\n\nDecision Strategist: Their move history doesn't show a clear pattern now. They've just won with paper, and players often repeat winning moves. If they play paper again: rock gives us +3, scissors gives us -1, paper gives us 0.\n\nGame Theorist: We need to consider that they've won the last three rounds, so they're gaining confidence in their strategy. After seeing our scissors, they might expect us to switch to rock to counter their paper, and thus they might play scissors to counter our anticipated rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: This game has become more psychological now that both sides understand the reversed payoff structure. We need to break our losing streak to avoid falling into a negative score.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given their recent adaptability and our need to score points, rock offers the best potential outcome. If they repeat paper, we get +3 points. If they play scissors anticipating our rock, we lose only 1 point. If they play rock, we tie.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

We've lost our entire advantage after losing 4 consecutive rounds.

They've won four consecutive rounds with different moves, showing adaptability.\n\nDecision Strategist: We need to break this pattern of losses. The opponent might be using some kind of pattern recognition to predict our moves. Since we just played rock, they might expect us to switch to paper (to beat their scissors). If they anticipate this, they might play rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's analyze potential moves:\n- If they play rock: scissors gives us +1, paper gives us -3, rock gives us 0\n- If they play paper: rock gives us +3, scissors gives us -1, paper gives us 0\n- If they play scissors: paper gives us +1, rock gives us -1, scissors gives us 0\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, we should introduce more randomness into our strategy to make our moves less predictable. However, given the immediate need to break our losing streak, scissors would win against rock, which they've played most frequently.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree with playing scissors. If they anticipate us switching to paper after our rock loss and play rock to counter, scissors would win us +1 point.

The opponent has clearly developed an effective strategy for predicting our moves. We need to significantly change our approach.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our options:\n- If they play scissors again: paper gives us +1, rock gives us -1, scissors gives us 0\n- If they play rock: scissors gives us +1, paper gives us -3, rock gives us 0\n- If they play paper: rock gives us +3, scissors gives us -1, paper gives us 0\n\nGame Theorist: The opponent has played scissors in two consecutive rounds. Given their pattern of successful countering, they might anticipate we'll play paper now and switch to rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: At this point, our predictable decision-making process is working against us. We need to introduce genuine randomness or a completely different approach.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given the situation, paper offers a moderate potential gain (+1) against scissors, which they've played most recently. While it risks losing against rock (-3), breaking our recent pattern might disrupt their prediction strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has clearly identified patterns in our decision-making process. After playing paper and losing against rock 4 times now, we need to completely break our patterns.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's analyze our own patterns. After we play paper, we've tended to play scissors or rock. The opponent might be exploiting these tendencies.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at potential outcomes:\n- If they play rock again: scissors gives us +1, paper gives us -3, rock gives us 0\n- If they play paper: rock gives us +3, scissors gives us -1, paper gives us 0\n- If they play scissors: paper gives us +1, rock gives us -1, scissors gives us 0\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has played rock against our paper multiple times for maximum points. They might anticipate we'll avoid paper now and play scissors or rock.\n\nDecision Strategist: To break our pattern and potentially catch them off guard, I recommend scissors. If they play rock again (their most frequent move), we'll gain +1 point. The risk against paper (-1) is less than the potential loss from playing paper against rock again.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The opponent's move distribution is: rock (8 times), paper (6 times), scissors (6 times).\n\nPsychology Expert: We've lost 12 consecutive rounds. The opponent may have identified a pattern in how we select moves. Looking at the last several rounds, we've been cycling through scissors, rock, paper in various orders, and the opponent has consistently countered us.\n\nDecision Strategist: Our strategy of trying different moves each round isn't working. The opponent might be anticipating our next move rather than just responding to our last move.\n\nGame Theorist: What if we try staying with one move for multiple rounds? This breaks the pattern of constantly changing moves that the opponent seems to be exploiting.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's a good point. By maintaining the same move, we might disrupt their prediction pattern. After 12 consecutive losses, a radical strategy change is warranted.\n\nDecision Strategist: I suggest playing rock. If they continue their pattern of countering what they think we'll play, they might play paper expecting us to switch to scissors. While rock loses to paper (-3), it's worth trying a completely different approach after so many consecutive losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent's move distribution is: rock (8), paper (6), scissors (7).\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent appears to be consistently one step ahead of us. No matter what strategy we've tried, they've countered it effectively. This suggests they might be using a sophisticated algorithm to predict our next move based on our past behavior.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given that conventional approaches have failed, we need a truly unexpected move. The opponent likely anticipates we'll switch to paper after losing with rock against scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: What if we break conventional RPS strategy and play the same move twice in a row? Since we just played rock and lost, playing rock again would be highly unexpected.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's actually a good psychological approach. Most RPS players avoid repeating the same move, especially after losing with it. The opponent may be exploiting this tendency.\n\nDecision Strategist: I agree. Playing rock again breaks the pattern of constantly switching that the opponent seems to be exploiting. If they expect us to play paper (the logical counter to their scissors), they might play rock, against which our rock would tie (0 points).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock"

The opponent's move distribution is now: rock (9), paper (6), scissors (7).\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a significant development! Playing rock twice in a row disrupted their prediction pattern. This suggests they were indeed anticipating that we would switch moves after each loss, which is standard RPS behavior.\n\nDecision Strategist: Now we face a new decision. The opponent might expect us to switch to paper (the conventional counter to rock) after the tie. Or they might think we'll continue our pattern-breaking strategy with rock a third time.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's consider our options:\n- If they expect us to play paper and counter with scissors, we'd lose 1 point with paper\n- If they expect us to play rock again and counter with paper, we'd lose 3 points with rock\n- If they play rock again (perhaps thinking we'll switch), scissors would win us 1 point\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie has changed the dynamic. After a long losing streak followed by a tie, there's psychological pressure to \"win\" rather than just not lose. This might lead us to switch to paper, which they could anticipate.\n\nDecision Strategist: Playing scissors would be unexpected at this point. Most players would either continue with rock (doubling down on a pattern-breaking strategy) or switch to paper (the conventional counter to rock). Scissors breaks both expectations.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors"

The dynamic has definitely changed.\n\nDecision Strategist: The opponent might now be trying to figure out our new pattern.
