    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to analyze the payoff structure of this game variant:\n   - Paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. For my first move against a new player, I need to evaluate expected value:\n   - Rock has highest upside (win +3) with minimal downside (lose -1)\n   - Paper has moderate upside (win +1) but severe downside (lose -3)\n   - Scissors has balanced outcomes (win +1, lose -1)\n\n3. Since this is the first move with no prior information, I'll choose the option with the best risk-reward profile.\n\n4. Rock offers the potential for the highest gain (+3) while limiting potential loss (-1).\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock is my optimal opening move.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyzing all rounds played:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played rock (I lost -3)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie)\n   - Round 12: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper (I won +3)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 16: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 17: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n\n2. Analyzing recent patterns:\n   - Their last 8 moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n   - They just tied with paper (both of us played paper)\n   - After ties, they typically switch to a different move\n\n3. Predicting their next move:\n   - When players tie, they often try to counter what they expect their opponent to play next\n   - They may expect me to play paper again and counter with scissors\n   - Scissors has been one of their frequent choices recently (5 of last 10 moves)\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play scissors as predicted, paper would win me +1 point\n   - If they switch to rock, paper would lose me -3 points\n   - If they repeat paper, we'd tie again (0 points)\n   - Given their recent pattern of frequently using scissors, paper remains my best choice\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Paper offers the best strategic choice against their likely scissors move.\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyzing recent pattern:\n   - Their recent sequence: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They just won significantly with rock against my paper (+3 points)\n   - After winning, they often stick with a successful move\n\n3. Predicting their next move:\n   - When players win big (+3 points), they often repeat the winning move\n   - Rock has been successful for them against my paper\n   - They may expect me to counter with scissors and be prepared\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play rock again as predicted, scissors would win me +1 point\n   - If they switch to paper to counter my expected scissors, rock would win me +3 points\n   - Rock has the best expected value with potential +3 win and worst case scenario of tie\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Rock offers the best strategic choice considering their likely moves.\n\n[move] Rock"
