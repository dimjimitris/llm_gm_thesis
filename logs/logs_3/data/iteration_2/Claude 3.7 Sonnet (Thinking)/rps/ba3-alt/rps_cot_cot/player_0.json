    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me consider each possible move:\n   - Paper: Wins against scissors (+1 point), loses to rock (-3 points)\n   - Rock: Wins against paper (+3 points), loses to scissors (-1 point)\n   - Scissors: Wins against rock (+1 point), loses to paper (-1 point)\n3. Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I should consider the expected value of each move assuming random play.\n4. If my opponent plays randomly (1/3 chance for each move):\n   - Paper expected value: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Rock expected value: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 points\n   - Scissors expected value: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n5. Based on this analysis, rock has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyzing my opponent's pattern:\n   - Their sequence: rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper\n   - They have played paper after scissors in the last round, breaking their usual pattern\n   - After their only previous paper play (round 6), they followed with scissors\n\n3. Given their historical pattern after paper:\n   - If they follow with scissors: Rock would win (+1), Paper would win (+1)\n   - If they return to rock: Rock would tie (0), Scissors would win (+1)\n   - If they play paper again: Rock would win (+3), Paper would tie (0)\n\n4. Rock has positive outcomes against 2 of their 3 possible moves, making it the safest choice with the highest potential gain.\n\n5.

Analyzing what my opponent plays after rock:\n   - After they play rock (their last move):\n     * Round 1 (rock) \u2192 Round 2 (scissors)\n     * Round 3 (rock) \u2192 Round 4 (scissors)\n     * Round 5 (rock) \u2192 Round 6 (paper)\n     * Round 8 (rock) \u2192 Round 9 (scissors)\n     * Round 10 (rock) \u2192 Round 11 (scissors)\n     * Round 14 (rock) \u2192 Round 15 (scissors)\n     * Round 16 (rock) \u2192 Round 17 (scissors)\n   - 6 out of 7 times (86%), they've played scissors after rock\n\n3. Given their strong tendency to play scissors after rock:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely): Paper would win (+1)\n   - If they play rock: Paper would lose (-3)\n   - If they play paper: Paper would tie (0)\n\n4. The pattern is one of their most consistent, and I've been having success recently by reading their tendencies.\n\n5. I'll play paper to counter their highly probable scissors move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper"
