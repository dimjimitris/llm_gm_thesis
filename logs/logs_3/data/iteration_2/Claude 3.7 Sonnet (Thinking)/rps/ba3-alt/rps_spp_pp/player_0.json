    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Looking at the payoff structure:\n- Rock beats scissors (+3/-3 points)\n- Scissors beats paper (+1/-1 points)\n- Paper beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n\nStatistical Analyst: The highest potential gain comes from playing rock when the opponent plays scissors (+3). However, rock is risky because if the opponent plays paper, you lose 1 point. In standard RPS, each move has equal expected value, but here rock has higher expected value.\n\nPsychologist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, they have no pattern to analyze. Many players begin with rock in RPS games due to psychological anchoring. We could exploit that tendency by playing paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the asymmetric rewards, rock seems like the strongest opening move. It offers the highest potential gain (+3) while risking a minimal loss (-1) if countered.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The Nash equilibrium for this variant would favor playing rock more frequently than the other options due to its risk-reward profile.\n\n[move] rock"

According to the results, scissors actually beat rock, contradicting the initial rule description. We lost 1 point when we played rock against scissors.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Based on the actual outcome, we need to revise our understanding of the payoff matrix:\n- Rock beats paper: +3/-3 (as stated)\n- Paper beats scissors: +1/-1 (as stated)\n- Scissors beats rock: +1/-1 (observed from result)\n\nPsychologist: After winning with scissors, many players tend to either stick with their winning move or follow a cycling pattern. Since scissors worked well for them, they might stick with it. Alternatively, they could switch to paper if they're following the traditional RPS rotation.\n\nStrategic Planner: If they play scissors again, our best counter is paper. If they switch to paper, we should play rock for the highest potential gain (+3). If they switch to rock, scissors would be optimal.\n\nGame Theorist: Given we have limited information about our opponent's strategy, I recommend playing paper. This counters scissors (their previous winning move) while only risking a -3 penalty if they happen to choose rock.\n\nPsychologist: I agree. Many players stick with a winning move, especially in early rounds. Paper is a reasonable counter to their likely scissors repeat.\n\n[move] paper"
