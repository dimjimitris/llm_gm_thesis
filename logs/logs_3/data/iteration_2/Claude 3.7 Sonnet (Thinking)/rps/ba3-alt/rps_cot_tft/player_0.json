    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me analyze the expected value of each possible move against a random opponent:\n   - Rock: (-3 vs Paper + 0 vs Rock + 1 vs Scissors)/3 = -2/3 points average\n   - Paper: (3 vs Rock + 0 vs Paper - 1 vs Scissors)/3 = 2/3 points average\n   - Scissors: (-1 vs Rock + 1 vs Paper + 0 vs Scissors)/3 = 0 points average\n\n4. Paper has the highest expected value against a random opponent.\n\n5. Additionally, first-time players often favor Rock as their opening move, making Paper particularly advantageous.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Paper to maximize my expected value.\n\n[move] Paper"

I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They just lost using Scissors\n   - They might anticipate me playing Paper again and switch to Rock (which beats Paper)\n   - They might also switch to Paper expecting me to change my strategy\n\n3. Examining the payoff structure:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against Paper\n   - Rock loses to Scissors with only a -1 penalty\n   - This makes Rock a higher-reward, lower-risk play\n\n4. Since my opponent just lost with Scissors, they're likely to switch to Rock to counter my previous Paper play\n   - If they choose Rock, Scissors would be my optimal response\n\n5. However, they might be thinking multiple steps ahead and choose Paper to counter my anticipated Rock\n   - The most balanced move that accounts for these possibilities is Scissors\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors, anticipating my opponent might switch to Rock after their loss.\n\n[move] Scissors"
