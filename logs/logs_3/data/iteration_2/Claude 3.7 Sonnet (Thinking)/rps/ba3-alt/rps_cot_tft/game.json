I need to consider what my opponent might do next:\n   - They just lost using Scissors\n   - They might anticipate me playing Paper again and switch to Rock (which beats Paper)\n   - They might also switch to Paper expecting me to change my strategy\n\n3. Examining the payoff structure:\n   - Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against Paper\n   - Rock loses to Scissors with only a -1 penalty\n   - This makes Rock a higher-reward, lower-risk play\n\n4. Since my opponent just lost with Scissors, they're likely to switch to Rock to counter my previous Paper play\n   - If they choose Rock, Scissors would be my optimal response\n\n5.
