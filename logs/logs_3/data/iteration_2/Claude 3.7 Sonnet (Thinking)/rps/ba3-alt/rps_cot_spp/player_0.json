    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

They seem to be alternating between Paper and Scissors recently.\n\n5. After losing with Paper against my Rock, they might switch to Scissors next (which would beat Rock according to the rules).\n\n6. If they follow their alternating pattern, they should play Scissors next.\n\n7. If they play Scissors:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (+1 point)\n   - Rock loses to Scissors (-1 point)\n   - Scissors ties with Scissors (0 points)\n\n8. Given their recent pattern and likely response to my Rock, Paper seems like the optimal move.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent's recent sequence:\n   Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n\n5. They've been strictly alternating between Paper and Scissors for the last 5 rounds. If this pattern continues, they should play Paper next.\n\n6. After I played Paper and won against their Scissors, they may expect me to play Paper again and might counter with Rock.\n\n7. Looking at my options:\n   - If they play Paper (following their alternation): Rock would win (+3 points)\n   - If they play Rock (countering my Paper): Scissors would win (+1 point)\n   - If they play Scissors (breaking pattern): Paper would win (+1 point)\n\n8. Rock seems optimal - it wins significantly against their most likely move (Paper) based on their alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Rock"

My total score remains at -3 points.\n\n3. Looking at what the opponent tends to do after Rock-Rock ties:\n   - After Round 2 (Rock tie), they played Scissors\n   - After Round 16 (Rock tie), they played Paper\n\n4. Looking at their overall pattern after ties:\n   - After Paper tie, they typically play Rock or Scissors\n   - After Rock tie, they've played Scissors or Paper\n   - After Scissors tie, they've played Paper\n\n5. The opponent just broke their alternating pattern of Paper-Scissors by playing Rock.\n\n6. After Rock ties, they've previously played either Paper or Scissors. Based on their pattern after our last Rock tie (Round 16), they played Paper in Round 17.\n\n7. If they play Paper next:\n   - Scissors would be my best move (+1 points)\n\n8. Scissors also protects me from their potential Scissors play (tie) while avoiding the big -3 loss if I play Paper and they play Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors"
