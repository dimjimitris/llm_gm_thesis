Let me re-read:\n\n- Paper beats rock (standard RPS rule)\n- Rock beats scissors (standard RPS rule)\n- Scissors beats paper (standard RPS rule)\n\nAnd the points are:\n- Paper beating rock: winner +1, loser -1\n- Rock beating scissors: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beating paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nThis is an interesting variant with asymmetric payoffs. Rock is the highest reward move if it wins, but also the highest penalty if it loses.\n\nSince this is the first move against a fresh player, I don't have any prior information about their strategy or tendencies. In standard RPS, all moves have equal expected value against a random opponent. But here, the expected values are different because of the asymmetric scoring.\n\nLet me think about the expected value of each move against a random opponent:\n- Paper: Wins against rock (+1), loses against scissors (-1), ties with paper (0)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n- Rock: Wins against scissors (+3), loses against paper (-3), ties with rock (0)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n- Scissors: Wins against paper (+1), loses against rock (-1), ties with scissors (0)\n  Expected value: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\nInteresting - even with the asymmetric payoffs, the expected values are the same for a completely random opponent. This makes sense because the game is still zero-sum.\n\nHowever, human players often have tendencies. Since rock has the highest potential gain and loss, people might either be drawn to it (for the high reward) or avoid it (fearing the high penalty). Without any data yet, I'll start with a standard opening.\n\nI'll choose rock. It has the highest potential reward if it wins, and since this is the first move, there's no pattern for the opponent to exploit yet.",

The other matchups have lower stakes (+1/-1).\n\nFor my next move, I should consider that my opponent just played scissors. They might:\n1. Stay with scissors expecting me to switch to paper\n2. Switch to rock expecting me to switch to scissors\n3. Switch to paper to counter a potential rock play from me\n\nGiven these possibilities, I'll choose paper. If they stick with scissors, I'll lose 1 point. If they switch to rock, I'll lose 3 points. But if they switch to paper (which seems likely after a win), we'll tie with 0 points.

This is interesting because scissors is not a dominant strategy in this game. If I were to always play paper against an opponent who always plays scissors, I would consistently win. However, the opponent has occasionally switched to rock, which beats my paper.\n\nI need to consider my next move carefully. Since the opponent has played rock in the last round, they might continue with rock or switch back to their more common scissors.\n\nIf they play rock again, my best move is paper.\nIf they switch back to scissors (which they seem to prefer), my best move is also paper.\nIf they switch to paper, rock would be my best move.\n\nGiven the observed pattern and the fact that scissors is their most common move, I'll choose paper for this round.",

It seems like they've caught on to the inverted rules and are trying to exploit them. However, paper beats scissors in this game, which is why I've been winning when I play paper against their scissors.\n\nFor my next move, I should continue with paper since the opponent has frequently played scissors, and paper beats scissors in this game.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
