    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I notice they've developed a counter-strategy - when I consistently play paper and win several rounds, they eventually switch to rock.\n\n4. Looking at rounds 9 and 12, they play rock after I've had success with paper.\n\n5. Given their successful counter with rock in the last round, they may:\n   - Continue with rock since it worked well (-3 points for me)\n   - Return to scissors (their most frequent move)\n   - Anticipate I'll switch to scissors and play paper\n\n6. Based on their pattern of playing several of the same move in sequence, they're likely to stick with rock after its success.\n\n7. Against rock, scissors would be my optimal move (+1 point).\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at what they do after paper-paper ties:\n   - Round 1: Paper \u2192 Round 2: Paper (another paper)\n   - Round 17-18: Paper streak \u2192 Round 19: Scissors\n\n5. Given their overall tendency to favor scissors (over 50% of all plays), there's a good chance they'll revert to their dominant strategy.\n\n6. To break this pattern of ties and losses, scissors would be a good strategic choice:\n   - If they play paper again, I win (+1)\n   - If they revert to scissors, we tie (0)\n   - If they play rock, I lose but only by 1 point (-1)\n\n7. The risk-reward analysis favors scissors in this situation.\n\n[move] scissors"

Looking at their pattern after scissors-scissors ties:\n   - Round 10: Scissors (tie) \u2192 Round 11: Scissors again\n   - Round 13: Scissors (tie) \u2192 Round 14: Paper\n   - Round 15: Scissors (tie) \u2192 Round 16: Scissors again\n\n4. After scissors-scissors ties, they've played scissors 2/3 times.\n\n5. Given their overall strong preference for scissors (over 50% of all plays), there's a high probability they'll play scissors again.\n\n6. If I expect them to play scissors, my best move would be paper (as paper beats scissors in this variant).\n\n7. While there is a risk they might play rock (-3 points), based on statistical evidence scissors remains their most likely move.\n\n[move] paper"

After losing to my paper move, they've played:\n   - Rock: 3/5 times (60%)\n   - Scissors: 2/5 times (40%)\n   - Never paper after losing to paper\n\n5. Based on this pattern, they're more likely to switch to rock after losing to my paper move.\n\n6. If they play rock, scissors would be my best move (as scissors beats rock in this variant).\n\n7. Even if they play scissors (their overall most common move), scissors would result in a tie rather than a loss.\n\n[move] scissors"
