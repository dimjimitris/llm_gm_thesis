    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

In traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors, rock is statistically chosen more frequently as a first move by players.\n\n5.

I've lost 9 rounds, won 1, and tied 1. My only win came when I played scissors against rock in round 5.\n\n4. My opponent just played rock after playing scissors. Looking at their pattern after playing rock, they've typically played:\n   - Rock followed by rock (once)\n   - Rock followed by paper (twice)\n   - Rock followed by scissors (twice)\n\n5. Given that my only success came from playing scissors against their rock, and they just played rock, I'll try scissors again.\n\n6. This is a balanced risk move (-1/+1) and has been my only winning play so far.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"

I've now lost 10 rounds, won 1, and tied 1. My opponent seems to be anticipating my moves extremely well.\n\n5.

My record: 3 wins, 1 tie, 16 losses.\n\n4. Looking at my opponent's pattern after rock:\n   - After rock, they've played paper 6 times out of 7\n   - This suggests they'll very likely play paper next\n\n5. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n6. I've noticed that all 3 of my wins came when I played scissors against their rock. However, since they almost always play paper after rock, I'll need to try scissors again.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"

If they play scissors, my best counter would be scissors (for a tie).\n   If they play rock, scissors would win me 1 point.\n   Both scenarios suggest scissors is my best choice.\n\n6.

After my opponent plays scissors, they've historically played:\n   - Rock (5 times out of 8)\n   - Paper (1 time out of 8)\n   - Scissors (2 times out of 8)\n   This suggests they're most likely to play rock next.\n\n5. If they play rock as predicted, paper would theoretically be my best counter. However, every time I've played paper (rounds 2, 8, 11, 17), they've countered with rock and I've lost 3 points.\n\n6. My only wins have come when playing scissors against their rock.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] Scissors"
