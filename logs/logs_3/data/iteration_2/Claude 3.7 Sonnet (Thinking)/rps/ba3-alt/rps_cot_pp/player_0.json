    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

First, I need to understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points \n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n2. This is different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors because the payoffs are asymmetric.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Looking at the payoffs, Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (3 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (1 point).\n\n5. Playing Paper gives me the highest potential gain (3 points if they play Rock), with only a small penalty (-1) if they play Scissors.\n\n6. Rock is risky - I could lose 3 points if they play Paper, while only gaining 1 if they play Scissors.\n\n7. Scissors has balanced risk-reward but lacks the high potential payoff of Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for the first move since it offers the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n   - Rock beats Paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n\n3. Oh, I see my mistake! In this game, Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around as in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors).\n\n4. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   - They might switch to Rock or Paper after losing with Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Paper again since I won\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n\n5. If I play Paper again and they switch to Rock, I lose 3 points\n   If I play Rock and they stick with Scissors, I lose 1 point\n   If I play Scissors and they switch to Paper, I win 3 points\n\n6. Since they've seen Paper work against them, they might choose Rock to beat Paper. In that case, my best response would be Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors this round to counter a potential Rock from my opponent.\n\n[move] Scissors"
