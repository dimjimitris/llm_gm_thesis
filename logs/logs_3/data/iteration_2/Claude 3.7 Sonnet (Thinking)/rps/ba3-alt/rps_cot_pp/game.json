First, I need to understand the payoff structure of this game:\n   - Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n   - Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points \n   - Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\n2. This is different from standard Rock-Paper-Scissors because the payoffs are asymmetric.\n\n3. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or patterns.\n\n4. Looking at the payoffs, Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (3 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (1 point).\n\n5. Playing Paper gives me the highest potential gain (3 points if they play Rock), with only a small penalty (-1) if they play Scissors.\n\n6. Rock is risky - I could lose 3 points if they play Paper, while only gaining 1 if they play Scissors.\n\n7. Scissors has balanced risk-reward but lacks the high potential payoff of Paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose Paper for the first move since it offers the best risk-reward ratio.\n\n[move] Paper"

Let me double-check the rules:\n   - Paper beats Scissors (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n   - Rock beats Paper (winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points) \n   - Scissors beats Rock (winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point)\n\n3. Oh, I see my mistake! In this game, Paper beats Scissors (not the other way around as in traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors).\n\n4. Now I need to consider what my opponent might do in this round:\n   - They might switch to Rock or Paper after losing with Scissors\n   - They might expect me to play Paper again since I won\n   - They might try to counter what they think I'll play\n\n5. If I play Paper again and they switch to Rock, I lose 3 points\n   If I play Rock and they stick with Scissors, I lose 1 point\n   If I play Scissors and they switch to Paper, I win 3 points\n\n6. Since they've seen Paper work against them, they might choose Rock to beat Paper. In that case, my best response would be Scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play Scissors this round to counter a potential Rock from my opponent.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Looking at the payoffs, Rock-Paper has the highest stakes (3 points), while the other matchups have lower stakes (1 point).\n\n5. Playing Paper gives me the highest potential gain (3 points if they play Rock), with only a small penalty (-1) if they play Scissors.\n\n6. Rock is risky - I could lose 3 points if they play Paper, while only gaining 1 if they play Scissors.\n\n7.

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Same moves result in a tie with 0 points for both\n\nThis is an interesting variant with asymmetric payoffs. The standard Rock-Paper-Scissors is balanced with equal payoffs for all win conditions, but this one has different values.\n\nLet me think about the optimal strategy:\n\n1. If I play Rock:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: 1 point (I win)\n\n2. If I play Paper:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: 3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n3. If I play Scissors:\n   - If opponent plays Rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays Paper: 1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIn a single game against a fresh player with no history, the optimal strategy would be to play each move with equal probability (1/3). However, given the asymmetric payoffs, I should slightly adjust my strategy.\n\nThe Rock-Paper matchup has the highest stakes (3 points), which makes Paper potentially attractive since it could yield high rewards. However, if my opponent is also thinking this way, they might lean toward playing Paper, which would make Scissors a good counter.\n\nGiven that it's the first round against a fresh player and there's no prior information, I'll go with Paper as my move. It has the highest potential reward (3 points if they play Rock), and even if they play Scissors, I only lose 1 point.",

The rules in this game are actually reversed from traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors! In this game:\n- Paper beats Scissors (not Scissors beats Paper)\n- Rock beats Paper (not Paper beats Rock)\n- Scissors beats Rock (not Rock beats Scissors)\n\nThis explains my confusion. Now let me track what's happened so far:\n- Round 1: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors, I won 1 point (Paper beats Scissors)\n- Round 2: I played Scissors, opponent played Rock, I won 1 point (Scissors beats Rock)\n- Round 3: I played Rock, opponent played Paper, I won 3 points (Rock beats Paper)\n\nWait, this is still inconsistent. If Rock beats Paper, then I should have won when I played Rock against their Paper. That matches the result, but contradicts my previous understanding of the rules. Let me re-read the rules again very carefully:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors (winner 1, loser -1)\n- Rock beats Paper (winner 3, loser -3)\n- Scissors beats Rock (winner 1, loser -1)\n\nSo in this variant:\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Rock > Paper\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nThis is consistent with the outcomes I've seen.

Stick with Paper since I just beat them with Rock (which would be illogical but sometimes players do this)\n4. Pick randomly\n\nIf they think I've identified their pattern, they might deliberately break it. \n\nGiven that Rock gives the highest payoff (3 points), they might expect me to play Rock again to maximize my potential gain. If they think I'll play Rock, they might play Scissors (which beats Rock).\n\nIf they play Scissors and I play Paper, I win 1 point.\nIf they play Rock and I play Scissors, I win 1 point.\nIf they play Paper and I play Rock, I win 3 points.\n\nSince I can't be certain what they'll do, and Paper has worked for me in the past (Round 1), I'll play Paper again.
