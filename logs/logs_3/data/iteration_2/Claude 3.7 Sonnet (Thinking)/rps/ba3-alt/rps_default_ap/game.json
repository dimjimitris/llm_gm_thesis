They might go with paper next. \n\nAccording to the rules:\n- If they play paper and I play rock, I lose 3 points\n- If they play paper and I play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If they play paper and I play scissors, I lose 1 point\n\nIf they play scissors:\n- If I play rock, I lose 1 point\n- If I play paper, I win 1 point\n- If I play scissors, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nIf they play rock:\n- If I play rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n- If I play paper, I lose 3 points\n- If I play scissors, I win 1 point\n\nLooking at expected values:\n- Rock: (-3 + -1 + 0)/3 = -4/3 points\n- Paper: (0 + 1 + -3)/3 = -2/3 points\n- Scissors: (-1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 0 points\n\nScissors seems to have the best expected value if I assume equal probability of the opponent's moves.
