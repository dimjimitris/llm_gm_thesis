    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk/reward of different moves\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In Rock Paper Scissors, with a fresh opponent and no prior history, game theory suggests that the optimal strategy is to play randomly with equal probability (1/3) for each move. This prevents being exploited by patterns.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no historical data to analyze. However, studies show that in RPS, \"rock\" is the most common opening move among new players, as it's perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nRisk Manager: Given that information, we could consider playing \"paper\" to counter the most likely \"rock\" opening. However, if we're wrong, we risk losing to \"scissors.\" Each move has equal expected value in a purely random game.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with both points. While paper could exploit a common human tendency, maintaining unpredictability from the start is valuable. Let's make a balanced choice that doesn't reveal any bias in our strategy.\n\nFinal collaboration!\n\nBased on the discussion, I'll choose paper as my opening move, considering it might counter the common \"rock\" opening while maintaining strategic ambiguity.\n\n[move] paper\n"

However, we need to consider that the opponent may adapt their strategy after losing.\n\nPattern Analyzer: After losing to paper, many players tend to switch to scissors to counter what they think might be a repeated move. This is a common psychological pattern - players often assume their opponent will repeat a winning move.\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown a predictable opening with \"rock,\" but now they have information about our play style. They might expect us to play paper again, making scissors their likely choice. However, if they're more sophisticated, they might expect us to switch to rock to counter their expected scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a classic mind game situation. We need to think one level deeper than our opponent. If they're thinking we'll play paper again, and they play scissors to counter, we should play rock. This covers the most likely adaptation while protecting against a potential prediction of our strategy.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological tendency to counter the previous winning move is strong enough to make rock our best play here.\n\nFinal collaboration!\n\n[move] rock\n"

Following this pattern, they might expect us to stick with rock (our winning move) and therefore play paper.\n\nRisk Manager: We're in a strong position with 2 points, but this is also a critical moment. The opponent has lost twice and might break from their pattern out of frustration. However, if they are indeed following a simple adaptive strategy, they're most likely to play paper to beat our previous rock.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, we should play scissors. Here's why:\n1. It counters the most likely paper play if they're following their pattern\n2. If they try to double-think and play rock, we only lose one point from our winning position\n3. It maintains our unpredictability while still responding to the observed pattern\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. The psychological pressure of two losses makes it highly likely they'll try to counter our previous move rather than make a random choice.\n\nFinal collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"
