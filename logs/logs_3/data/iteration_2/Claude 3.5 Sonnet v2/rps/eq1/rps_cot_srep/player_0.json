    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Analyzing game history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, they played paper (I lost)\n   - Round 2: I played scissors, they played scissors (tie)\n   - Pattern shows opponent switched from paper to scissors\n\n2. Analyzing the tie situation:\n   - Opponent demonstrated they're willing to switch moves\n   - They matched my scissors play, either:\n     a) By coincidence\n     b) By predicting my counter to their paper\n     c) By following a pre-planned sequence\n\n3. Psychology after a tie:\n   - Players often feel compelled to break the deadlock\n   - Common to switch after a tie\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch\n\n4. Opponent's possible reasoning:\n   - They might expect me to switch to rock (beats their expected scissors)\n   - They might switch to paper to beat that rock\n   - Or they might stick with scissors thinking I'll be predictable\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If I play paper: beats rock if they switch to it\n   - If I play rock: beats scissors if they stay\n   - If I play scissors: maintains pressure but likely predictable\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - Paper is the optimal choice because:\n     - Beats rock if they make the most logical switch\n     - Changes my pattern to be less predictable\n     - Counters the most likely strategic move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Now at 6 wins, 9 losses, 6 ties (Score: -3)\n   - Recent sequence:\n     * P vs S (loss)\n     * S vs R (loss)\n     * P vs P (tie)\n   - Finally stopped the losing streak with a tie\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Both players chose paper after their rock/scissors exchange\n   - Opponent has shown they can:\n     * Counter predictable moves\n     * Match unpredictable moves\n     * Adapt to meta-strategy\n\n3. Psychology after tie:\n   - Momentum slightly neutralized\n   - Both players likely to switch from paper\n   - They've shown excellent prediction skills\n   - Normal tendency would be to play scissors after paper tie\n\n4. Strategic depth:\n   - First level: Most would play scissors after paper\n   - Second level: They might expect this and play rock\n   - Third level: They might expect me to play paper to beat their rock\n   - Fourth level: They might play scissors to beat that paper\n\n5. Current game state:\n   - They're significantly ahead in score\n   - They've shown superior reading of the game\n   - Simple patterns haven't worked\n   - Complex patterns haven't worked\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Will play rock because:\n     - Counters the most obvious move (scissors after paper)\n     - Less predictable than switching to scissors myself\n     - If they play paper thinking I'll expect scissors, it shows they're becoming predictable\n     - If they play scissors thinking I'll play paper, I win\n     - Most importantly, it's a strong defensive play when opponent has shown mastery of offensive reads\n     - I need to focus on solid fundamentals rather than trying to outthink their predictions\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete game history:\n   - Now at 6 wins, 10 losses, 6 ties (Score: -4)\n   - Critical observation: Every single time I've played rock (7 times now), they've either played paper (5 times) or rock (2 ties)\n   - I have NEVER won with rock\n   - This is a clear pattern I must acknowledge\n\n2.

Strategic considerations:\n   - They might expect scissors to counter their paper\n   - They might play rock to counter expected scissors\n   - But they've shown they can think multiple steps ahead\n   - Need to break their successful reading pattern\n\n6.
