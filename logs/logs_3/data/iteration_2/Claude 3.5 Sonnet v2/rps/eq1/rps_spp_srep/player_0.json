    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Pattern Analyzer - For studying opponent behavior patterns\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: For the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy or patterns. In such cases, it's important to consider that Rock-Paper-Scissors is a balanced game where each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying in theory.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. With no prior information, we shouldn't take unnecessary risks. Any move has an equal expected value mathematically speaking. However, from psychological studies, rock is often a common first move choice among players.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since we're starting fresh, we can't analyze any patterns yet. But we can use the psychological insight that many players tend to choose rock as their first move. This would suggest that paper might be a good counter-strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: That's sound reasoning. Paper would beat rock if the opponent goes with the psychologically common first move, and against scissors or paper, we'd either lose or tie respectively, making it a reasonable balanced choice.\n\nRisk Manager: I concur with using paper as our first move. It has potential upside against a common opening move (rock), while having manageable downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper is chosen as it can counter the psychologically common opening move of rock while having balanced risk-reward against other possibilities.\n"

They might be an experienced player who anticipated our \"paper counters common rock\" strategy\n2. They might have a preference for scissors\n3. Or it could be a random choice\n\nRisk Manager: Given we lost the first round, we need to be careful about potential patterns. The opponent might:\n1. Stick with scissors after a success\n2. Switch to another move thinking we'll try to counter scissors\n3. Try to establish a pattern to trick us\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, I suggest we use rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with scissors (which winners sometimes do), rock will win\n2. If they try to counter what they think we'll do (which would be scissors to beat their previous scissors), they might use rock, in which case we'd tie\n3. If they use paper, we'd lose, but it's a calculated risk\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with the rock strategy. It's too early to establish a clear pattern, but countering their previous successful move is a solid tactical choice.\n\nRisk Manager: Rock also provides good psychological value here - it shows adaptability and willingness to counter, which might influence future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After losing to scissors, we choose rock as it counters their previous winning move while providing reasonable coverage against other possibilities.\n"

Let's analyze what we know:\n- Round 1: They played scissors (beat our paper)\n- Round 2: They played scissors again (lost to our rock)\nThis shows a potential pattern - they stuck with scissors despite losing. This could mean:\n1. They might be predictable and stick to scissors again\n2. They might finally switch after two scissors moves\n3. They might be trying to establish a false pattern\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent's consecutive scissors moves despite different outcomes is noteworthy. If they're a rational player, they're more likely to switch after a loss. We need to consider their likely adaptations.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they've lost with scissors, the probability of them switching is high. Most players don't stick with a losing move three times in a row. They might expect us to play rock again (since it just won), and thus might choose paper to counter.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The psychological pressure after losing often leads to a strategy change. If they think we'll stay with our winning move (rock), paper would be their optimal choice.\n\nGame Strategist: Therefore, I suggest we play scissors this round. Here's the logic:\n1. If they switch to paper (highly likely), we win\n2. If they stubbornly stick to scissors, we tie\n3. If they try to be clever and use rock, we lose - but this seems less likely given the pattern\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

This could mean:\n1. They might be a very stubborn player with a fixed strategy\n2. They're trying to condition us before making a dramatic switch\n3. They might be using a simple automated strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Three consecutive scissors moves is extremely unusual. The fact that they continued even after losing suggests either:\na) Limited strategic thinking\nb) A very sophisticated trap where they're trying to make their pattern seem obvious\n\nRisk Manager: This is a critical decision point. The obvious choice would be rock to counter their scissors pattern. However, this might be exactly what they're waiting for if they're setting up a trap.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given human psychology, it's extremely rare for a player to use the same move four times in a row, especially after not winning the last two rounds. The pressure to change strategy would be immense.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend we play rock. Here's why:\n1. If they're truly stuck in a pattern, we win\n2. If they finally switch to paper (trying to be clever), we lose\n3. If they switch to rock (playing safe), we tie\nThe expected value is still positive given the strong scissors pattern.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree.

This is significant because:\n1. They switched to rock after three scissors moves\n2. They chose a 'safe' move (rock is often considered defensive)\n3. They might be starting to play more strategically\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has demonstrated they can change strategy. Their switch to rock might indicate:\n1. They're becoming more cautious after not winning for three rounds\n2. They're starting to play more unpredictably\n3. They might be trying to establish a new pattern\n\nRisk Manager: Their switch from an aggressive move (scissors) to a defensive move (rock) suggests they might be becoming more conservative. However, after a tie, players often feel pressure to win rather than tie again.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given they just used rock and got a tie, psychological patterns suggest they're likely to either:\n1. Switch to paper to beat an expected rock\n2. Stick with rock hoping for stability\n3. Go back to their \"comfort move\" of scissors\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we play paper this round. Here's the reasoning:\n1. It beats rock if they stay conservative\n2. It beats a return to rock if they're seeking stability\n3. If they go back to scissors or switch to paper, we lose, but the psychological indicators suggest rock or stability is more likely\n\nRisk Manager: Paper does seem like our best option.

They might expect us to switch to rock (common defensive move)\n3. If they maintain paper, we win\n4. If they use rock, we lose, but maintaining paper or switching to rock seems less likely after a tie\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Scissors offers good potential:\n1. Beats paper if they're cautious\n2. Catches them if they try to counter our expected rock\n3. Shows we're matching their strategic depth\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given their demonstrated sophistication and the tie situation, they're more likely to switch than maintain paper, making scissors a strong offensive choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Following the tie and considering their demonstrated strategic depth, we choose scissors anticipating their likely switch from paper while accepting the calculated risk of a rock counter.\n"

Two consecutive ties\n2. Both players showing high-level strategic thinking\n3. Game has evolved into sophisticated mind games\n\nGame Strategist: The situation is complex:\n1. Both players are reading each other well\n2. Neither has a clear advantage\n3. After two ties, pressure to win increases\n\nRisk Manager: After double ties:\n1. Both players will want to break the stalemate\n2. Risk of over-thinking opponent's strategy increases\n3. Temptation to make unexpected moves grows\n\nPattern Analyzer: Psychological factors suggest:\n1. High pressure to break tie sequence\n2. Tendency to avoid three-way tie\n3. Likelihood of aggressive move to force decision\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. After scissors-scissors tie, players often stick with scissors trying to break the tie\n2. If they switch to paper expecting our rock, we lose\n3. If they switch to rock themselves, we tie\n4. Most importantly, it beats their potential scissors commitment\n\nRisk Manager: Rock provides balanced coverage:\n1. Wins against continued scissors play\n2. Safe against another rock\n3. Reasonable risk against paper switch\n\nPattern Analyzer: The double tie creates psychological pressure that often leads players to maintain their move, making rock a strong counter to potential scissors persistence.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Following two consecutive ties and considering the psychological pressure to break the stalemate, we choose rock anticipating either continued scissors play or a conservative rock switch.\n"

Three consecutive ties\n2. Perfect mirroring of moves\n3. Unprecedented stalemate situation\n\nGame Strategist: This is an extraordinary situation:\n1. Three ties in a row shows extremely matched thinking\n2. Both players are reading each other perfectly\n3. Pressure to break this triple tie is immense\n\nRisk Manager: After triple ties:\n1. Breaking pattern becomes crucial\n2. Risk of continuing mirror pattern is high\n3. Need for unexpected move increases\n4. Psychological pressure at peak\n\nPattern Analyzer: The triple tie creates unique dynamics:\n1. Both players likely desperate to break pattern\n2. Tendency to overthink increases\n3. Might lead to overcompensation in strategy\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors. Here's why:\n1. After three ties, paper is the obvious counter to rock\n2. They might expect us to use paper and counter with scissors\n3. So we pre-empt their scissors with our scissors\n4. If they use rock again, we lose, but four consecutive same moves is unlikely\n5. If they use paper, we win\n\nRisk Manager: Scissors offers strong potential:\n1. Breaks the tie pattern decisively\n2. Counters the obvious paper play\n3. Shows strategic depth in predicting counter-moves\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological pressure of three ties makes paper the obvious next move, but that very obviousness makes it dangerous.

Strong recovery strategies\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. They might switch to scissors expecting us to stay with scissors or switch to paper\n2.
