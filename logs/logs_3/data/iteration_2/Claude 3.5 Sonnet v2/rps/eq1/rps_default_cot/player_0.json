Earlier in the game, they showed success with unexpected pattern breaks\n4. They've demonstrated they can think strategically, even if recent moves haven't worked\n\nIn this high-pressure situation, they might:\n- Return to their comfort move (rock) out of frustration\n- Play paper to counter my potential rock continuation\n- Use scissors again, thinking I wouldn't expect a repeat after it just lost\n\nGiven the psychological pressure of four straight losses, players often either:\na) Return to their most comfortable strategy (rock in their case)\nb) Make a bold move to break the pattern\n\nI think the pressure will push them toward option (a) - returning to their historically successful rock strategy. I'll play paper to counter this expected return to rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

This was well-executed - they correctly anticipated I would expect them to make an aggressive move with scissors. Now the situation has changed:\n\n1. They've just had a morale-boosting win after a long losing streak\n2. They succeeded by breaking away from their rock tendency\n3. They might feel validated in using paper, their winning move\n4. The psychological pressure has shifted somewhat back to me after losing my streak\n\nAfter their successful paper play, they might:\n- Stick with paper since it just worked and broke their losing streak\n- Expect me to play scissors to counter potential paper repeat\n- Return to rock now that they've regained some confidence\n\nGiven that they've just had success breaking their rock pattern with paper, and considering their demonstrated ability to think ahead, they'll likely expect me to counter with scissors. Therefore, they'll probably play rock to counter my expected scissors. I'll play paper to counter this expected rock play.\n\n[move] paper\n"
