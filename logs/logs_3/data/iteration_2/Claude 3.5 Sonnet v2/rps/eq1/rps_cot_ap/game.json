Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - Rock is strong against scissors but weak against paper\n   - Paper is strong against rock but weak against scissors\n   - Scissors is strong against paper but weak against rock\n\n4. In game theory, when all options are equally likely and there's no prior information, a random choice is often optimal to avoid being predictable.\n\n5. For this opening move, I'll choose rock:\n   - It's a solid opening move\n   - It's psychologically seen as a \"strong\" first move\n   - Many players tend to choose scissors less frequently on their first move\n\n[move] rock\n"

Critical psychological moment:\n   - They've just lost three times to rock\n   - They've played scissors six consecutive times\n   - This is a breaking point where:\n     a) They MUST realize this strategy isn't working\n     b) They've lost too many times to justify continuing\n     c) The pressure to change is immense\n\n3.
