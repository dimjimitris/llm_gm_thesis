After a paper-paper tie, many players would be tempted to switch to scissors, thinking their opponent will stick with paper\n2. Rock would beat their scissors if they make this common psychological play\n3. If they try to be extra clever and play paper expecting my rock, they would win - but this is a less likely scenario as it requires more levels of prediction\n4.
