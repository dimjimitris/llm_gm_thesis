    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In this situation:\n   - Rock would be good against Scissors but lose to Paper\n   - Paper would be good against Rock but lose to Scissors\n   - Scissors would be good against Paper but lose to Rock\n\n4. Since this is the first move:\n   - A common opening move by players is Rock (many players instinctively choose Rock first)\n   - To counter this tendency, Paper might be a good strategic choice\n   - However, sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose Scissors\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given this is a fresh start\n   - Without any pattern to analyze\n   - Paper has potential advantage against predicted Rock\n   - Risk of opponent choosing Scissors exists but is acceptable\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as an opening move, anticipating a possible Rock first strategy from my opponent.\n"

Psychology for next move:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - The opponent might expect me to change my move\n   - They might try to counter my expected change\n\n3. Common patterns after ties:\n   - Many players shift to the move that would have beaten their previous choice\n   - In this case, they might expect me to switch to scissors (beats previous paper)\n   - They might choose rock to counter expected scissors\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Stay with paper: Risky as opponents rarely repeat after a tie\n   - Switch to scissors: Obvious move, might be anticipated\n   - Switch to rock: Could work if opponent switches to scissors\n\n5.

Pattern analysis so far:\n   - Round 1: Paper vs Paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: Rock vs Rock (tie)\n   - Opponent seems to be matching my moves or using similar logic\n   - Two consecutive ties suggests strong parallel thinking\n\n2. Behavioral tendencies after consecutive ties:\n   - Players become more determined to break the tie pattern\n   - There's often an increased urgency to \"win\" rather than tie again\n   - This can lead to more aggressive or less predictable moves\n\n3. Opponent analysis:\n   - They've shown strategic thinking (paper opening)\n   - They've demonstrated similar reasoning to mine\n   - They might be analyzing my pattern as well\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   - After Rock-Rock tie, scissors might seem too obvious\n   - Paper might seem like a safe return to round 1\n   - But the urge to break ties might push for a decisive move\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - If they expect me to continue pattern matching, they might choose paper\n   - If they're trying to break pattern, scissors becomes more likely\n   - Paper would be risky against potential scissors\n   - Rock would be safe against scissors but lose to paper\n   - Scissors would win against paper but lose to rock\n\n6. Decision making:\n   - Given the parallel thinking shown so far\n   - And the likely desire to break the tie pattern\n   - Scissors provides the best balance of risk and reward\n   - It wins against the \"safe\" paper choice\n   - It's also less obvious than the other options after a rock-rock tie\n\n[move] scissors I choose scissors, breaking from the previous pattern and anticipating either a paper play or our parallel thinking continuing.\n"
