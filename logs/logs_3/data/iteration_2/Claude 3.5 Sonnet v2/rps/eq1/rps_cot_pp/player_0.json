    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Risk assessment:\n   - They know I know their paper-after-tie pattern\n   - They know scissors worked for me last time\n   - They might:\n   * Break their pattern to avoid being predictable\n   * Test if I'll try scissors again\n   * Use rock to counter expected scissors\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - While history suggests they'll play paper\n   - The recent successful prediction makes this less likely\n   - They probably expect me to use scissors again\n   - Their most logical counter would be rock\n   - To counter their probable rock\n\n[move] paper I choose paper, expecting them to break their paper-after-tie pattern with rock to counter my potential scissors play.\n"
