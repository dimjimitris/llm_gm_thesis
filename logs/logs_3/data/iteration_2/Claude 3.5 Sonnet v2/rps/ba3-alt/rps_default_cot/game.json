Opponent strategy reassessment:\n- They used mirroring to condition our expectations\n- Then broke pattern when we chose scissors (lowest risk move)\n- This suggests they:\n   * Are very strategic\n   * May have been waiting for us to play scissors\n   * Might return to mirroring to confuse us\n   * Or might continue with new aggressive strategy\n\n3. Risk calculation for next move:\n- If they return to mirroring: any move ties\n- If they continue aggressive play:\n   * They might expect us to play rock to counter their paper\n   * Then they could play scissors\n- If they're truly strategic, they're thinking multiple moves ahead\n\n4.

Pattern analysis:\n- Opponent has shown they can:\n   * Counter our consistent plays\n   * Punish both aggressive and conservative strategies\n   * Read our attempts to be unpredictable\n   * Use both big punishments (rock) and small ones (paper)\n\n3. Psychological warfare:\n- They just used paper against our scissors\n- They might expect us to:\n   * Continue with scissors (our recent pattern)\n   * Switch to rock to counter paper\n   * Make aggressive move due to mounting losses\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n- Paper: Risky (-3 vs rock, their favorite punishment)\n- Rock: Could win vs scissors (+1) or lose big (-3)\n- Scissors: Just lost to paper, might be expected\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n- Will play rock because:\n   * Counters their last move (paper)\n   * If they play scissors: we win +1\n   * If they play paper again: we lose -3 (risk we must take)\n   * If they play rock: we tie\n   * Breaks our scissors pattern\n   * Shows adaptation to their strategy\n   * Different enough from recent moves\n   * Need to make some calculated risks\n   * Can't keep playing scissors after they just countered it\n   * Time to show we can adjust our strategy\n\n[move] rock\n"

Deep pattern analysis:\n- Opponent consistently:\n   * Mirrors when we play conservatively\n   * Punishes when we make predictable changes\n   * Uses both rock and paper effectively against us\n   * Shows perfect timing in breaking patterns\n\n3. Psychology after rock tie:\n- They might expect us to:\n   * Stay with rock (continuing recent play)\n   * Switch to paper (to beat rock)\n   * Return to scissors (our previous common move)\n- Each option has clear counters\n\n4. Risk-reward calculation:\n- Paper: High risk (-3 vs rock), high reward (+3 vs rock)\n- Scissors: Medium risk (-1 vs rock), medium reward (+1 vs paper)\n- Rock: Safe (0 if mirrored), but predictable\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n- Will play scissors because:\n   * After rock tie, paper is too obvious and risky\n   * If they play rock again: only lose -1\n   * If they play paper (expecting us to stay rock): we win +1\n   * If they mirror: we tie\n   * Different from our last move\n   * Shows controlled aggression\n   * Balances risk and reward\n   * Protects against major losses\n   * Breaks the pattern they might expect\n\n[move] scissors\n"
