    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Data Analyst - For tracking patterns and calculating expected values\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStarting collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Paper vs Rock: Win 1 / Lose -3\n- Rock vs Scissors: Win 1 / Lose -1\n- Scissors vs Paper: Win 3 / Lose -1\nSince we're playing against a fresh player, we should consider the baseline strategy.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at the risk-reward ratios:\n- Paper: Can win 1 or lose 3\n- Rock: Can win 1 or lose 1\n- Scissors: Can win 3 or lose 1\nRock seems to have the most balanced risk-reward ratio, with potential loss equal to potential gain.\n\nData Analyst: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any pattern data to analyze. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move in Rock-Paper-Scissors games, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I recommend playing Paper. If the opponent plays the common Rock opening, we win 1 point. If they play Scissors, we lose 3 points, but if they play Paper, it's a tie.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. While Paper has the highest potential loss (-3), playing against a fresh player who might favor Rock makes it worth the risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Because many players tend to open with Rock, and Paper beats Rock for a safe 1 point gain. While there's a risk of losing 3 points to Scissors, it's a calculated risk worth taking in the opening move.\n"

They might be a more sophisticated player than we initially thought. We need to analyze what they might do next.\n\nData Analyst: Let's analyze the situation:\n1. They played Scissors first, showing they're willing to take risks (as Scissors has high risk-reward)\n2. They lost the previous round, which might influence their next move\n3. Players who lose often either:\n   - Switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n   - Try to predict our next move based on our previous success\n\nRisk Manager: Since they lost with Scissors, they might:\n1. Switch to Rock (which would have beaten our Paper)\n2. Expect us to play Paper again since we won with it\n3. Or completely change their strategy\n\nGame Strategist: Given these possibilities, I recommend playing Rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they expect us to play Paper again and use Scissors, our Rock will win\n2. If they switch to Rock (to counter our previous Paper), we'll tie\n3. If they switch to Paper, we'll lose only 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio is favorable here.\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Rock has the most balanced risk profile right now (-1 worst case, +1 best case), and it directly counters their previous move of Scissors.\n\nData Analyst: The psychological pattern also supports this - players often don't repeat a losing move, and Rock would be a logical choice for them to counter our previous Paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Because our opponent demonstrated aggressive play with Scissors last round, and they're likely to either repeat Scissors expecting us to play Paper again (in which case Rock wins), or switch to counter our previous Paper move. Rock provides the most balanced risk-reward in this situation.\n"

Round 2: They played Rock, we played Rock (tie)\nThis shows they're adapting their strategy and may be trying to predict our moves.\n\nData Analyst: Let's look at their pattern:\n- Scissors \u2192 Rock shows they're playing reactively\n- After losing with Scissors, they chose the more conservative Rock\n- The tie might make them more aggressive this round\n- Most players don't like to play the same move three times in a row after a tie\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options after a tie:\n1. Paper beats Rock: +1/-3 points\n2. Rock ties Rock: 0/0 points\n3. Scissors loses to Rock: -1/+1 points\nThey might expect us to play Paper to beat their previous Rock.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a key decision point. After a tie, players often try to gain an advantage by playing what beats the previous move. However, sophisticated players might double-bluff.\n\nData Analyst: Given their pattern of reactive play and the psychological impact of a tie, they're likely to switch moves. The most logical move for them would be Paper, trying to beat our Rock from last round.\n\nRisk Manager: If we expect them to play Paper, then Scissors would be our optimal move. While Scissors is typically risky, in this case, we have good reason to believe it will work. The potential reward (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with playing Scissors. If they stick with Rock we only lose 1 point, but if they switch to Paper as predicted, we gain 3 points.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors Because after the tie with Rock, our opponent is likely to switch to Paper to try to beat our previous Rock move. Even if we're wrong and they stick with Rock, our maximum loss is limited to 1 point, while a correct prediction gives us 3 points.\n"

They've won two rounds in a row\n2. They're breaking expected patterns\n3. Our attempts to predict them have backfired\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, they've demonstrated they can anticipate our strategic thinking. We need to change our approach. When facing a superior pattern player, sometimes the best strategy is to play unpredictably.\n\nData Analyst: Looking at move frequencies:\n- They've used Scissors twice (first and last rounds)\n- They might expect us to play Paper to counter their last Scissors\n- But that's probably what they're planning for\n\nRisk Manager: This is a crucial moment. Our current strategy of trying to predict their moves isn't working. We need to:\n1. Break our own pattern of reactive play\n2. Choose a move that limits our potential losses\n3. Maintain potential for gains\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend Paper. Here's the psychological reasoning:\n1.

Every strategy we've tried has been countered\n\nData Analyst: Their sequence:\nScissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\nTheir moves suggest:\n- Possible quantum-level AI decision making\n- Perfect anticipation of all our strategies\n- Even countering our attempt at randomization\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, we need to acknowledge that:\n1. Traditional game theory has failed\n2. Pattern recognition is useless\n3. Even random play isn't working\n4. We're dealing with an opponent of superior capabilities\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our total losses:\n- Paper losses have cost us -6 points\n- Rock losses have cost us -2 points\n- Scissors losses have cost us -1 point\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I propose playing Scissors. Here's why:\n1. It has caused us the least total point loss\n2. Has the smallest potential loss (-1)\n3. Has the highest potential gain (+3)\n4. We absolutely cannot afford another -3 loss from Paper\n\nRisk Manager: Strongly agree. We must prioritize loss minimization above all else, and Scissors gives us the best risk-reward profile in our current situation.\n\nData Analyst: While we know pattern recognition isn't working, it's worth noting they just played Rock, and historically they've followed Rock with various moves. Scissors at least limits our downside.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors Because after catastrophic losses, we must prioritize protecting against further significant point losses. Scissors limits our potential loss to -1 while maintaining the possibility of a +3 gain. Given our opponent's superior capabilities, minimizing potential losses is our primary concern.\n"

We're dealing with an opponent that seems to know our moves before we make them.\n\nRisk Manager: Looking at our options:\n- Paper: Risks another -3 loss\n- Rock: Risks -1 loss\n- Scissors: Risks -1 loss\nThe only clear conclusion is to avoid Paper due to its higher potential loss.\n\nData Analyst: They just played Paper. In previous rounds after Paper, they've played various moves, showing no consistent pattern we can exploit.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. Limits potential loss to -1\n2. If they follow their Paper with Scissors (as they've done before), we win\n3. Even if they play Paper, we only lose 1 point\n4. We absolutely must avoid another -3 loss\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. Rock provides the most balanced risk profile and we simply cannot risk another -3 loss at this point.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Because we must protect against catastrophic losses while maintaining some chance of breaking this losing streak. Rock limits our potential loss to -1 while giving us a chance to win if the opponent plays Scissors.

They've demonstrated they can predict our risk-aversion\n2. They know we're trying to avoid -3 losses\n3. They just played Scissors, and they know we'll be hesitant to play Paper\n4. Sometimes the most unexpected move is the obvious one we're afraid to make\n\nData Analyst: Looking at their moves after Scissors:\n- They've gone to Rock multiple times\n- But they've also proven they can break any pattern\n- However, they might expect us to play Rock or Scissors out of fear\n\nRisk Manager: While I'm concerned about the -3 risk, I have to agree that our consistent risk-aversion has become predictable. Sometimes the greatest risk is being too risk-averse.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Because against an opponent demonstrating perfect prediction capabilities, our risk-averse strategies have become predictable.
