    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

First round against a fresh player - I need to consider the payoff structure:\n   * Rock vs Paper: Winner (Paper) gets 3, Loser gets -3\n   * Paper vs Scissors: Winner (Scissors) gets 1, Loser gets -1\n   * Scissors vs Rock: Winner (Rock) gets 1, Loser gets -1\n   * Same moves result in 0 points for both\n\n2. Analyzing the risk/reward:\n   * Paper has highest potential gain (3) but also highest potential loss (-3)\n   * Rock and Scissors both have lower stakes (\u00b11)\n\n3. For a first move against an unknown opponent:\n   * Paper is high-risk, high-reward\n   * Rock and Scissors are safer options\n   * Since I don't have information about opponent's tendencies yet, a balanced approach might be best\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * Rock is slightly advantageous because:\n     - It beats Scissors with +1 points\n     - If opponent plays Paper, -3 points is not drastically worse than -1\n     - In Rock vs Rock, no points lost\n\n[move] rock I choose a balanced opening move with rock, which offers decent winning potential while limiting extreme losses.\n"

Recent sequence analysis:\n   * Last six rounds:\n     - R16: rock vs scissors (lost, -1)\n     - R17: scissors vs scissors (tie, 0)\n     - R18: scissors vs paper (lost, -1)\n     - R19: rock vs paper (won, +3)\n     - R20: rock vs scissors (lost, -1)\n     - R21: scissors vs scissors (tie, 0)\n   * Increasing volatility in outcomes\n   * More ties and losses recently\n\n2. Updated statistics:\n   * Opponent's moves:\n     - Scissors: 11 times (now most common)\n     - Paper: 10 times\n     - Rock: 0 times\n   * After scissors plays, they historically:\n     - Either repeat scissors\n     - Or switch to paper\n   * Recent scissor frequency increasing\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * They're showing comfort with scissors\n   * Successfully defending against rock strategy\n   * Still maintaining rock avoidance\n   * Might feel confident after recent scissors success\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   * Given scissors most recent play:\n     - They might stick with scissors (shown multiple times)\n     - Could switch to paper (common alternation)\n     - Rock remains highly unlikely\n   * Their strategy is more sophisticated now\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   * Rock too predictable after recent losses\n   * Scissors could lead to another tie\n   * Paper beats their frequent scissors\n   * Paper loses minimally to scissors (-1)\n   * Paper wins significantly against rock (+3) if they finally try it\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as their increased scissors usage makes it strategically optimal, while maintaining acceptable risk if they switch to scissors, and offering high reward if they finally try rock.\n"
