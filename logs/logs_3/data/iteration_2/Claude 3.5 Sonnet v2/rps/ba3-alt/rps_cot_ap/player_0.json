    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent pattern analysis:\n   * Last three significant moves:\n     - Long rock streak by opponent\n     - Sudden switch to paper (beat my scissors)\n     - Another paper (lost to my rock)\n   * They've now played paper twice in a row\n   * Shows they've definitely abandoned rock strategy\n\n2. Psychological assessment:\n   * Opponent has demonstrated:\n     - Ability to maintain fixed strategy (rock streak)\n     - Ability to make strategic shifts (to paper)\n     - Willingness to stick with new strategy despite loss\n   * They might be:\n     - Committed to paper now\n     - Planning another strategic shift\n     - Trying to establish new pattern\n\n3. Meta-game consideration:\n   * After losing with paper, they might:\n     - Expect me to play rock again (since it worked)\n     - Try scissors to counter expected rock\n     - Return to their comfortable rock strategy\n     - Continue with paper hoping I overthink\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   * If they stick with paper: rock wins (+3)\n   * If they play scissors: rock loses (-1)\n   * If they return to rock: rock ties (0)\n   * They've shown they can maintain strategies but also break them\n\n5. Decision making:\n   * Rock is optimal because:\n     - They've shown commitment to new strategies once adopted\n     - Paper plays suggest they're moving away from rock\n     - Even if they play scissors, loss is minimal (-1)\n     - Potential for big win (+3) outweighs small loss risk\n     - They seem to prefer defensive moves over aggressive ones\n\n[move] rock\n"
