    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Each move has equal chances of winning, losing, or drawing. However, studies show that \"rock\" is often the most common first move among new players.\n\nPsychology Expert: That's right. Many players tend to choose \"rock\" as their first move because it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Since this is a fresh opponent, they might follow this common pattern.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given this information, we could choose \"paper\" to counter the likely \"rock\" move. However, if the opponent is also strategic, they might anticipate this and choose \"scissors.\" The risk-neutral approach would be to randomly select among the three options to be unpredictable.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with choosing paper. While it's not guaranteed to win, it has a good chance against a fresh player's likely rock move, and even if we're wrong, it's not worse than any other choice in terms of expected value.\n\nPsychology Expert: I concur. Paper is a good strategic choice for the first move, especially against a new player.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move against a fresh player, paper has a good chance of success against the common opening move of rock.\n"

However, after losing, players often change their strategy.

Is more sophisticated than we thought\n2. Randomly chose scissors\n3. Anticipated our paper strategy\n\nDecision Analyst: Given they won the last round, psychology suggests they might:\n- Stick with scissors because it worked (momentum play)\n- Switch because they think we'll adapt\n- The key is to not be too predictable while still considering likely human patterns\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I suggest using rock. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with scissors (winner's momentum), we win\n2. If they try to counter what they think we'll do (expecting us to switch to rock and thus choosing paper), we lose\n3. If they completely randomize, we have equal chances\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with rock. People often ride their winning strategy for at least one more round, especially in simple games like this. The psychology of \"if it works, don't fix it\" is strong.\n\nDecision Analyst: The risk-reward ratio favors rock here.

The opponent seems to be following a clear pattern - they're cycling through moves in this order: rock -> scissors -> (likely paper next). This is actually a common unconscious pattern in RPS when players aren't using a truly random strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Excellent observation! Let's analyze:\n- Round 1: They played scissors\n- Round 2: They played scissors again\nIf they are a pattern player, and given human tendency to avoid the same move three times in a row, they are very likely to switch now.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's evaluate:\n1. If they're following the common cycle: rock -> scissors -> paper, they'll play paper next\n2. If they're trying to be unpredictable after two scissors plays, they might switch to rock\n3. The least likely move from them is a third scissors, as that's rare in human psychology\n\nPsychology Expert: Given they've won twice with scissors, there might be a small temptation to use it again, but that would be highly unusual in human gameplay. I strongly believe they'll switch, and paper is the most likely next move based on the common cycling pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors.

They seem to be using a systematic pattern, but we've been one step behind each time.\n\nGame Strategist: You're right. If they continue this pattern, they should play rock next. This pattern is too consistent to be coincidence. Looking at their moves:\nrock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 (likely rock next)\n\nDecision Analyst: However, we need to consider that:\n1.

Players who find a successful pattern often stick to it until it fails. The psychological comfort of a working system usually outweighs the urge to be unpredictable.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's use paper. Here's the logic:\n- If they maintain their pattern (most likely), they'll play rock and we'll win\n- If they try to outsmart us by breaking the pattern, they're most likely to go for scissors (trying to predict our paper)\n- But given their success with the pattern so far, pattern breaking is less likely\n\nDecision Analyst: Agreed.

We need to consider what a player does after their pattern is broken and they lose.\n\nDecision Analyst: After a player breaks their pattern and loses, there are typically three common responses:\n1. Return to the pattern (would mean rock next)\n2. Play what would have beaten their previous move (rock to beat their own scissors)\n3. Play what would have beaten our winning move (scissors to beat our paper)\n\nPsychology Expert: The loss might sting more because it broke their winning streak.

Revert to scissors as a \"desperate aggressive move\"\n2. Try to completely switch up their style\n3. Become highly reactive to the last round\n\nGame Strategist: One interesting pattern in their play: when they're losing, they seem to revert to \"basic\" moves (like rock) rather than trying to be clever. This suggests they might continue this \"back to basics\" approach.\n\nDecision Analyst: I recommend rock. Here's why:\n1. They're likely to play scissors as an aggressive \"comeback\" move\n2. If they try paper to beat our previous scissors, we lose but this seems less likely given their current psychological state\n3. If they play rock (reverting to basics again), we tie\n\nPsychology Expert: I strongly agree with rock. The psychological pressure of five straight losses often leads to aggressive, scissors-based plays as players try to \"cut\" their way out of a losing streak. Also, scissors feels like the most \"active\" move when players feel they need to do something dramatic to change their fortune.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock After an unprecedented five consecutive losses, the opponent is most likely to make an aggressive play with scissors as a desperate attempt to break their losing streak. Their recent tendency to revert to basic moves under pressure has failed, which may push them toward this aggressive strategy.\n"

If they try rock (to beat our potential paper), we lose but are still way ahead\n4. The psychological barrier to playing paper three times in total might push them away from that move\n\nPsychology Expert: I agree with scissors.
