    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For tracking and analyzing opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk/reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, for a fresh game with no prior history, there's no dominant pure strategy in Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each move has a 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or drawing. Without any information about the opponent's tendencies, we should avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we have no pattern data to analyze yet. We should start with a baseline move and then adapt based on the opponent's responses in future rounds.\n\nRisk Manager: Given equal win/loss points (+1/-1) and no prior information, our primary goal should be to maintain unpredictability. Rock is often a common first move for many players, so we might want to counter that tendency.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Since many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, paper would be a strategic first choice. If they do play Rock, we win (+1), and if they predict our counter to Rock and play Scissors, we only lose 1 point, which is the same risk level as any other move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Let's go with paper and carefully observe the opponent's response for future rounds.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper\n"

A sophisticated player who anticipated our paper play\n2. A player who has a preference for scissors\n3. Or simply random choice\n\nGame Strategist: Since they won with scissors in the first round, there are two common psychological patterns we might expect:\n1. They might stick with their winning move (scissors)\n2. They might expect us to play rock to counter their previous scissors, in which case they might play paper\n\nRisk Manager: Given these possibilities, I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n- If they stick with scissors (possibility 1), we tie (0 points)\n- If they switch to paper (possibility 2), we win (+1 point)\n- If they play rock, we lose (-1 point)\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with scissors. It also maintains unpredictability since we're not making the obvious counter-move to their previous scissors (which would be rock).\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Playing scissors here could also help us understand if they have a pattern or are playing randomly. Let's observe their response carefully.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Playing randomly\n\nRisk Manager: If they are following the pattern that Pattern Analyzer spotted (moving backwards through scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper), they would play paper next. However, they might also expect us to pick up on this pattern and try to deceive us.\n\nGame Strategist: Given all this, I recommend we play rock for these reasons:\n- If they are following the backwards pattern and play paper, we win (+1)\n- If they try to counter what they think we'll play (assuming they think we'll play scissors again), they might play rock, leading to a tie (0)\n- If they try to be unpredictable and play scissors, we lose (-1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Rock seems like our best move.

This seems too consistent to be coincidence.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're truly following this pattern, their next move should be scissors again, continuing the cycle. However, we should consider:\n1. They might realize we've won three times and change their strategy\n2. They might have been playing randomly and the pattern we see is coincidental\n3.

However, if they are indeed following a strict pattern, they will play scissors next. This suggests we should play rock to counter the expected scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree with playing rock.

However, we finally lost a round, which might affect their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown remarkable consistency in their pattern despite losing three rounds in a row.

They're hoping we'll overthink and deviate from countering their pattern\n\nRisk Manager: After our first loss, psychology becomes important:\n- They might feel validated in maintaining their pattern since it finally worked\n- They might expect us to doubt the pattern now\n- If the pattern holds, they will play rock next\n\nPattern Analyzer: Given that they've stuck to their pattern for four consecutive rounds, even through three losses, I believe they're likely to continue. If so, they'll play rock next.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing paper:\n- If they maintain their pattern and play rock, we win (+1)\n- If they finally break pattern and play scissors, we lose (-1)\n- If they play paper, we tie (0)\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed.

While they played rock as predicted, we lost again. The backwards cycle (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper) has held true for all five rounds.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. We've lost two rounds in a row, and their pattern has remained consistent throughout. If they maintain their pattern, they should play paper next. However:\n1. Two consecutive losses might make them more confident in their strategy\n2. This could be the perfect moment for them to break pattern\n3. They might expect us to be hesitant to trust the pattern after two losses\n\nRisk Manager: The stakes are higher now with two consecutive losses.
