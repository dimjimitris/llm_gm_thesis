    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Recent game history focus:\n   * Round 9: I scissors, they rock (Win)\n   * Round 10: I rock, they paper (Win)\n   * Round 11: I paper, they scissors (Win)\n   * I'm on a three-win streak\n\n2. Momentum analysis:\n   * Three consecutive wins indicates strong momentum\n   * Opponent has lost three straight\n   * They might be frustrated or tilted\n   * They might make an emotional rather than logical move\n\n3. Opponent's recent moves:\n   * rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   * They've completed a full cycle\n   * After three losses, they're very likely to:\n     - Completely change their strategy\n     - Break any patterns\n     - Try something unexpected\n\n4. Psychological factors:\n   * After three losses, players often:\n     - Revert to their \"comfort\" move\n     - Play more defensively\n     - Or become extremely aggressive\n   * Rock is often a \"comfort\" move in stressful situations\n\n5. Decision:\n   * I'll play scissors\n   * Reasoning:\n     - They might play defensively with rock (their comfort move)\n     - They might try paper to counter expected rock\n     - After using all three moves in sequence, they might reset to rock\n     - Even if they play paper, scissors wins\n     - The psychological pressure of three losses might make them play more predictably\n     - Scissors gives me the best chance against their likely defensive or reset moves\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Decision:\n   * I'll play paper\n   * Reasoning:\n     - After their successful paper play, they're likely to switch\n     - They might expect scissors from me to counter their paper\n     - This could lead them to play rock defensively\n     - If they try scissors expecting my paper, they win\n     - But after just breaking a long tie streak:\n       * They're more likely to play cautiously\n       * They might want to consolidate their success\n       * Rock is a common \"stabilizing\" move\n     - Paper beats the probable defensive rock play\n     - The psychological pressure of breaking the tie streak might make them more conservative\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent game history:\n   * Round 21: I scissors, they scissors (Tie)\n   * Round 22: I rock, they paper (Win)\n   * Round 23: I paper, they scissors (Win)\n   * Game has become more dynamic after tie streak\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * Their recent moves:\n     - scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n     - They seem to favor scissors recently\n     - They're showing aggressive tendencies\n     - No longer mirroring my moves\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   * After losing following their tie-breaking win:\n     - They might feel frustrated\n     - Could become more aggressive\n     - Might try to establish a new pattern\n     - Could revert to more defensive play\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * They've used scissors twice recently\n   * Their play style has become more aggressive\n   * They might expect me to:\n     - Play rock to counter their scissors\n     - Continue with paper since it just won\n     - Try to predict their next adaptation\n\n5. Decision:\n   * I'll play rock\n   * Reasoning:\n     - They've shown preference for scissors lately\n     - After a loss, players often stick with their last move hoping for better results\n     - If they try paper to counter expected rock, they win\n     - But their recent aggressive style suggests scissors is likely\n     - Rock is strong against:\n       * Continued aggressive scissors play\n       * Emotional response to previous loss\n       * Attempt to maintain aggressive momentum\n     - The psychological state after losing suggests they're more likely to be aggressive than strategic\n\n[move] rock\n"
