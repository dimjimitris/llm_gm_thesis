    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Looking at the game mechanics:\n   * Rock beats scissors\n   * Scissors beats paper\n   * Paper beats rock\n   * All wins give +1 point, losses give -1 point\n   * Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   * Rock is strong against scissors but weak to paper\n   * Paper is strong against rock but weak to scissors\n   * Scissors is strong against paper but weak to rock\n\n4. In this situation, a common strategy is to start with rock:\n   * Rock is psychologically seen as a \"strong\" opening move\n   * Many new players tend to choose rock in their first move\n   * If opponent also chooses rock, it results in a tie (0 points) rather than a loss\n\n5. However, if opponents are aware of this tendency, they might choose paper to counter rock.\n\n6. After weighing these factors, I think paper would be a strategic first move:\n   * It beats the common \"rock\" opening\n   * If opponent tries to be clever and chooses scissors, I only lose one point\n   * It sets an unpredictable tone for future rounds\n\n[move] paper\n"

Common patterns after ties:\n   * Many players switch to scissors after a paper tie\n   * This is because scissors beats the previous move (paper)\n   * Opponent might think this is my logical next step\n\n4.
