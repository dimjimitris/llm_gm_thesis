    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Their pattern of persistent moves is now very clearly established. However, after losing three times in a row to scissors, they absolutely must change strategy now. They might:\n1. Finally switch to paper to counter my successful scissors streak\n2. Return to their original scissors comfort zone\n3. Despite all logic, stick with rock due to their tendency to persist with moves\n\nGiven that they've now demonstrated twice (with scissors and rock) that they'll stick with a move well past the point of rationality:\n\n[move] scissors I'll use scissors once more, betting on their behavioral pattern of move persistence outweighing rational strategy\n"

Return to their original scissors preference\n3. Incredibly, stick with rock again\n\nDespite their pattern suggesting they might stick with rock yet again, four straight losses is likely beyond even their persistence threshold:\n\n[move] rock I'll switch to rock, anticipating they'll finally switch to paper to counter my successful scissors streak\n"
