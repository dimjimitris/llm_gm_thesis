    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns in opponent's behavior\n3. Risk Analyst - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy. The game is a typical rock-paper-scissors scenario with equal payoffs. In such cases, a random strategy is often effective to avoid being predictable.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move, we can't analyze any patterns yet. However, we should make note of our move and the opponent's response for future rounds.\n\nRisk Analyst: Each move has equal risk (-1) and reward (+1). With no prior information, no move is inherently riskier than others. Some players tend to choose rock as their first move as it's perceived as \"strong\", so paper might be a slight advantage.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. While any move is theoretically equal, going with paper as our first move could give us a slight edge if the opponent follows the common tendency to choose rock first.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as my first move, considering that many players tend to start with rock.\n"

They might be using a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n2. They might stick with paper since it resulted in a tie\n3. They might expect us to switch and plan accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: When opponents show similar strategic thinking, they often try to \"outsmart\" each other by thinking one level deeper. Since both chose paper last time, they might expect us to switch to scissors to beat their paper, and thus they might switch to rock to beat our scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: The opponent seems to be a strategic player rather than a random one, given their first paper choice. In this mind-game situation, going two levels deep in thinking might be optimal. If they expect us to choose scissors, and thus they choose rock, we should choose paper.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the two-level deep strategy. Let's choose paper again, but for a different reason than our first round - now we're choosing it to beat the rock we expect them to play.\n\nPattern Analyst: This will also help us establish if the opponent has a pattern or if they're using adaptive strategies.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper Using second-level strategic thinking, expecting opponent to choose rock in anticipation of our scissors.\n"

Instead of trying to counter our expected scissors, they directly countered our paper. This suggests they might be using a simpler, more direct counter-strategy rather than multi-level thinking.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -1 points. The opponent has shown they can adapt and are likely watching our patterns. Since we've used paper twice, they might expect us to switch now. We need to break any pattern they might be detecting.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they countered our last move with rock, they might:\n1. Stick with rock since it worked\n2. Expect us to use scissors to beat their rock, and thus switch to paper\n\nPattern Analyst: If they're using a direct counter-strategy, and they won with rock, they might stick with it.

The opponent seems to be one step ahead of us each time. We need to break this pattern.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're now at -2 points total. Our strategic thinking has been too predictable. Sometimes in games, when logical strategies are being countered, introducing controlled randomness can be effective.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. We've tried paper twice and scissors once, but haven't used rock yet. The opponent might be expecting us to use rock since it's our only unused move.\n\nPattern Analyst: Their sequence has been paper-rock-paper. This could either be a deliberate pattern or coincidental. If it's a pattern, they would play rock next.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given our current losing streak, we need to take calculated risks. Let's use rock for two reasons:\n1. It's unexpected as we haven't used it yet\n2. It would win against their scissors if they try to counter our expected move\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

We need a complete strategy reset. When complex strategies fail, sometimes the best approach is to go back to basics.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their moves: paper-rock-paper-scissors... If this is a pattern, they would play paper next. However, they've proven to be highly adaptive, so relying on this pattern might be a trap.\n\nGame Strategist: I propose we use a truly random approach for this round. Our attempts at strategic thinking have been consistently countered, suggesting our logic might be too predictable.\n\nRisk Analyst: Agreed. Let's use a pure random choice without any strategic reasoning. This removes any potential for our thinking process to be predicted.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is a random choice, I'll contribute a random selection: scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Using a purely random selection to break away from predictable strategic thinking.\n"

Our random approach has resulted in two consecutive ties.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent seems to be mirroring our moves when we use random choices, suggesting they might have shifted their strategy after establishing their early lead. They may be playing conservatively now to maintain their point advantage.\n\nRisk Analyst: We're still at -3 points overall. While ties don't improve our score, they're better than losses. However, we need to score some wins to improve our position.\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has shown they can:\n1. Counter our strategic moves (rounds 2-4)\n2. Match our random moves (rounds 5-6)\nThis suggests highly sophisticated adaptive play.\n\nGame Strategist: Since they've matched our last two random moves, they might be trying to read our randomization pattern. We could use this expectation against them.\n\nRisk Analyst: I suggest rock for this round. Here's why:\n1. If they continue matching, they'll also play rock = tie\n2. If they expect us to play paper again (as we did last round), they might play scissors, in which case rock wins\n3. If they try to counter rock directly, they'll play paper and we lose, but this risk is worth taking given our current score\n\nPattern Analyst: Agreed. This combines both random selection and strategic thinking in a way that might be harder to predict.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Using rock as it provides a good balance of defensive (tie) and offensive (win) possibilities based on opponent's recent matching behavior.\n"
