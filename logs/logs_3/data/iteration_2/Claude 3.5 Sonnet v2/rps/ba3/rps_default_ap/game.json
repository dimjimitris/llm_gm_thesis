However, they've just lost significantly to paper (-3), and in the past, big losses have sometimes triggered them to switch.\n\nLooking at their pattern throughout the game:\n- They stick with moves for long streaks\n- But after taking multiple -3 losses, they eventually switch\n- They've now lost -3 twice to paper in three rounds\n\n[move] paper While they might switch after this -3 loss, their demonstrated tendency to maintain long streaks (like their 7 papers and 4 rocks) suggests they might stick with rock for at least one more round. I'll risk paper again.\n"
