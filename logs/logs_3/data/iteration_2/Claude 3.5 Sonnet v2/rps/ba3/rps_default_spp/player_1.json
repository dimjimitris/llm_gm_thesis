    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Behavioral Psychologist - For understanding opponent psychology\n3. Strategic Planner - For developing game plans\n\nLet's start collaborating!\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at the payoff matrix, this is an interesting variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Paper has the highest reward (3 points) but also highest risk (-3 points). Rock and Scissors have lower risk/reward (\u00b11 point). Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we should consider the safest opening move.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: In the first move against a new player, many players tend to choose Rock as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening move. We could exploit this tendency.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this is our first move and we don't have any prior information about the opponent's strategy, we should balance between potential reward and risk. Paper would give us the highest reward if the opponent plays Rock, but it's very risky with a -3 penalty if they play Scissors. I suggest playing Rock as a safe opening move to gather information about the opponent's style.\n\nGame Theorist: I concur. Rock is a balanced first move. At worst we lose 3 points (against Paper), but we could gain 1 point (against Scissors), and if they also pick Rock, we tie with no loss.\n\n[move] rock Opening with a balanced move to assess opponent's strategy.\n"

This could indicate either:\n1. They're aggressive and favor high-risk, high-reward moves\n2. They predicted our \"safe\" Rock opening\n3. It could have been random\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Players who succeed with an aggressive move often get confident and might repeat the same strategy. However, sophisticated players might anticipate that we'll expect Paper again and switch to something else. Since they won big, they might feel confident enough to try Paper again.\n\nStrategic Planner: We have two main options:\n1. Predict they'll use Paper again and counter with Scissors\n2. Assume they'll anticipate our Scissors and switch to Rock, in which case we should use Paper\n\nGame Theorist: Given the high-reward success they just had with Paper, there's a psychological tendency to repeat winning moves. I recommend countering with Scissors. Even if we're wrong, we only risk losing 1 point (against Rock), while we could gain 1 point if we're right (against Paper).\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. The risk-reward ratio of using Scissors here is favorable, and it directly counters their previous successful strategy.\n\n[move] scissors Countering potential repeated Paper strategy with moderate risk-reward ratio.\n"

However, they might also expect us to think this and use Rock again. The safest play with potential high reward would be Paper here.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. If they use Rock again (which they might, given it just worked), we get maximum points. If they use Scissors (which they haven't tried yet), we only lose 1 point.

Become more cautious after losing big points\n\nStrategic Planner: Their established pattern would suggest Scissors comes next after Rock.

We've reversed the momentum with two consecutive wins\n2. They're sticking to their pattern even after we've detected it, which either means:\n   - They're committed to their strategy\n   - They're setting us up for a trap\n   - They're hoping we'll overthink and deviate from countering their pattern\n\nStrategic Planner: If they maintain their pattern, Paper would be next (as the sequence starts over).

However, the payoff matrix shows that if we're wrong about Scissors:\n- Against Rock: lose 1 point\n- Against Paper: win 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio is still favorable.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I believe they're more likely to finally break their pattern after two consecutive losses.
