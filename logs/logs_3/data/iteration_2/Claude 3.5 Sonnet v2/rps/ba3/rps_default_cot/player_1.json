    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

From this analysis:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - But also the highest potential loss (-3)\n   - Rock and Scissors have more balanced outcomes (+1/-1)\n\n4. For a first move, I should consider:\n   - Without knowing opponent's tendencies, going for highest reward is risky\n   - A balanced approach might be better\n   - Rock is often a common first move choice for many players\n\n5. Given these considerations:\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n     - If opponent plays rock (a common first move), I get maximum points (+3)\n     - If opponent plays scissors, my loss is minimal (-1)\n     - This provides a good risk/reward ratio for first move\n\n[move] paper\n"

Recent trend analysis:\n   - Their last four moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - They've played scissors three times in a row\n   - Got two losses and one tie from this sequence\n   - They seem stuck in a scissors pattern\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n   - After three consecutive scissors plays:\n     * They might feel trapped in a pattern\n     * Could be playing somewhat automatically\n     * Might be hoping for me to make a mistake\n     * Need to break out of this scissors cycle\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - Three scenarios:\n     * They continue with scissors (stuck in pattern)\n     * They switch to rock (to break pattern conservatively)\n     * They switch to paper (to break pattern aggressively)\n   - Given their psychological state:\n     * Continuing scissors seems unlikely (failed 3 times)\n     * Paper is risky after scissors streak\n     * Rock is safest change from scissors\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - They're most likely to break their scissors pattern\n   - Rock is the most logical switch from scissors\n   - Rock is also their most familiar move\n   - Therefore, paper would be optimal to counter expected rock\n\n[move] paper\n"
