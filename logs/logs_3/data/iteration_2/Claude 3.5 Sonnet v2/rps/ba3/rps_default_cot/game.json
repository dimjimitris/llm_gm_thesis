This completes their cycle of counters (paper->rock->scissors), so they might expect me to play scissors expecting their paper\n3. If they try to continue their winning streak with scissors again, rock wins\n4. While they've historically punished my rock moves with paper, they haven't used paper in several rounds\n5.

Strategic considerations:\n   - They've lost four times playing rock (-12 points total)\n   - They must realize rock is their worst move\n   - After a -3 loss, they typically avoid repeating that move\n   - They might return to the matching strategy that gave them ties\n\n5. Decision making:\n   - Given their recent experience:\n     * Rock has failed them repeatedly\n     * Matching strategy worked better\n     * They need to change approach\n   - Most likely they'll:\n     * Avoid rock completely\n     * Either try scissors (aggressive counter) or paper (return to matching)\n   - Paper is too passive after a big loss\n   - Scissors is more likely as an aggressive counter\n   - Therefore, rock would be optimal\n\n[move] rock\n"

Decision making:\n   - Key factors:\n     * They just lost their momentum\n     * Rock has failed them again\n     * They need to break the pattern\n     * They'll want to avoid another -3 loss\n   - Analysis:\n     * Most likely response:\n       - Switch to scissors to counter expected paper\n       - This offers them potential win (+1)\n       - And avoids risk of another -3 loss\n     * Therefore:\n       - Rock would be optimal to counter expected scissors\n       - If they play paper instead, I lose 3 (risk)\n       - But their recent -3 loss makes paper less likely\n\n[move] rock\n"
