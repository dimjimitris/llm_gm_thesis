After a scissors tie, rock is often a common next move as it beats scissors\n3. However, this opponent has shown they can think beyond obvious progressions\n\nLooking at our broader pattern, we've had several situations where conventional strategic thinking leads to ties or losses. The opponent seems particularly good at predicting standard strategic progressions.\n\nInstead of playing paper to counter their expected rock (which would be the counter to our scissors tie), I'll play scissors again. This decision is based on:\n1. They might expect me to switch to either rock (safe) or paper (counter to expected rock)\n2. Maintaining scissors might catch them if they try to outsmart the obvious rock play\n3. Even if they do play rock, I only lose 1 point, whereas if they predict my paper, I'd lose 3\n\n[move] scissors\n"

When I've been most successful, it's been with more straightforward plays rather than trying to outwit them at multiple levels.
