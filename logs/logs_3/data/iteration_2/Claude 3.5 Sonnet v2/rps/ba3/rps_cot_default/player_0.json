    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move without any prior information:\n   - Playing Paper is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Rock or Scissors are safer options with less variance\n   - Many players tend to choose Rock as their first move due to psychological comfort\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Since Rock is a common first move\n   - Paper would be the optimal counter to this tendency\n   - The potential +3 points outweigh the risk\n\n[move] paper Since this is the first move, I'm taking a calculated risk with paper, anticipating a possible rock play while accepting the higher stakes involved.\n"

Psychology for second round:\n   - After a tie, players often change their move\n   - Opponent might expect me to switch from paper\n   - They might switch to scissors to counter potential paper repeat\n\n3. Considering the payoff matrix again:\n   - If they switch to scissors (likely), paper would be bad (-1)\n   - If they switch to rock (possible), paper would be good (+3)\n   - If they stay with paper (unlikely), it's another tie\n\n4. Strategic options:\n   - Rock would be safe against expected scissors (+1)\n   - Rock would be poor against repeated paper (-3)\n   - Scissors would be good against repeated paper (+1)\n   - Scissors would tie against scissors (0)\n\n5.

Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent lost last round\n   - Players often become more aggressive after a loss\n   - They might want to go for the highest possible gain (+3)\n\n3.
