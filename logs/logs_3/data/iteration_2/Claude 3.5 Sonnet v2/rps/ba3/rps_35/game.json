Recent pattern analysis:\n   * They just played rock (breaking their losing streak with a tie)\n   * They might see this tie as a small victory after many losses\n   * Previous tie (Round 6) was also with rock\n   * After their last rock tie (Round 6), they switched to paper\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * The tie might give them some confidence back\n   * They might feel they've finally stopped their losing streak\n   * Could see rock as their \"safe\" move now\n   * Might be regaining some strategic thinking\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * If they stick with rock (feeling safe): paper wins +3\n   * If they expect me to counter rock with paper: scissors wins +1\n   * If they try to surprise with scissors: rock wins +1\n   * They haven't had two ties in a row yet\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   * Paper has highest reward but highest risk\n   * After a tie, they've historically changed moves\n   * They might be regaining composure after stopping their losing streak\n\n[move] paper After achieving a tie with rock, they might stick with it as a \"safe\" move that stopped their losing streak. Even if they expect this play, they've shown reluctance to use scissors recently. I'll risk paper for the higher reward.\n"

          "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Complete game history focus on recent:\n   * Round 20: I rock, they scissors (won +1)\n   * Round 21: I scissors, they paper (won +1)\n   * Round 22: I paper, they rock (won +3)\n   * Round 23: I rock, they scissors (won +1)\n   * Their sequence: scissors\u2192paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n   * I'm on a remarkable winning streak\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   * My prediction of their emotional scissors play was correct\n   * They've now lost with all three moves recently\n   * Their moves follow emotional rather than logical patterns\n   * They seem trapped in a cycle of predictable responses\n\n3. Psychological evaluation:\n   * They've lost consistently with every possible move\n   * May feel completely outplayed and read\n   * Likely in a state of learned helplessness\n   * Might abandon any attempt at strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   * After losing with scissors, historically they change moves\n   * They might see rock as too costly (-3 loss)\n   * Paper hasn't worked against my scissors\n   * They need something to break their losing pattern\n\n5. Risk/reward analysis:\n   * If they play rock (defensive): paper wins +3\n   * If they repeat scissors (unlikely): rock wins +1\n   * If they try paper (surprise): scissors wins +1\n   * They might seek safety rather than aggression now\n\n[move] paper After another scissors loss, they're likely to seek safety with rock, avoiding both scissors (just lost) and paper (loses to scissors). While paper is the riskiest play, their pattern of seeking safety after aggressive moves fail suggests rock is their most likely choice.\n"
