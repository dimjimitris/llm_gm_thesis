    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern observation:\n   - We're in another mirror match\n   - Second scissors-tie in game\n   - Opponent has consistently outthought my attempts to be clever\n   - Their rock play has been their most reliable strategy\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing rock: Safe against scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Playing paper: Wins against rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Playing scissors again: Could lead to another tie\n   - Rock has been their go-to defensive move\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - After scissors-tie, rock is obvious move\n   - They've punished obvious plays before\n   - But they've also used rock successfully\n   - Their rock play has been their foundation\n   - Sometimes obvious play is correct play when opponent over-thinks\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper, predicting they will return to their reliable rock strategy after the scissors tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Recent game sequence:\n   - Round 20: I scissors, they rock (lost -1)\n   - Round 21: I paper, they paper (tie 0)\n   - Round 22: I scissors, they scissors (tie 0)\n   - Round 23: I paper, they rock (won +3)\n   - Just had significant win reading their rock tendency\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - They just lost significantly with rock\n   - Rock has been their reliable move throughout game\n   - But they've shown good adaptation after losses\n   - They've consistently punished predictable plays\n   - They rarely repeat moves after big losses\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - They just lost 3 points\n   - Likely to abandon rock after big loss\n   - May be frustrated their reliable move failed\n   - Might seek immediate revenge\n   - Could expect me to play paper again after success\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - If I repeat paper: likely to lose to scissors (-1)\n   - If I play rock: safe against scissors (+1)\n   - If I play scissors: risky if they switch to rock (-1)\n   - They're likely to abandon rock after big loss\n\n5. Strategic calculation:\n   - They know paper just worked well for me\n   - They expect me to potentially repeat paper\n   - Scissors is their logical counter to expected paper\n   - Rock would be safe against their likely scissors\n   - Need to protect against their likely adaptation\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock, anticipating they'll use scissors to counter my successful paper play.\n\n[move] rock\n"
