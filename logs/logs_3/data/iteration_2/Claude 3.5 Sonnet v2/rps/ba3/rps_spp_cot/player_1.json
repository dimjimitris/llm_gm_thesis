    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beating rock gives highest points (3)\n   - Rock beating scissors gives fewer points (1)\n   - Scissors beating paper gives fewer points (1)\n\n3. From a risk-reward perspective:\n   - Paper has highest potential gain (3) but moderate risk (-1 if scissors)\n   - Rock has lower potential gain (1) but higher risk (-3 if paper)\n   - Scissors has lower potential gain (1) but lower risk (-1 if rock)\n\n4. Without knowing opponent's tendencies, I should choose the option that:\n   - Has potential for highest gain\n   - Is commonly chosen by first-time players\n   - Many players tend to choose rock as their first move\n\n5. Based on this analysis, I'll choose paper:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely), I get 3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point (manageable risk)\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n[move] paper\n"

Considering the payoff matrix:\n   - If they switch to rock as predicted, paper would win (3 points)\n   - If they stick with paper, it's another tie (0 points)\n   - If they go scissors anticipating my paper, I lose small (-1 point)\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - Most risky would be keeping paper if they switch to scissors\n   - Safest might be rock, but has highest penalty if wrong (-3 if they stay paper)\n   - Scissors could win if they stay paper, but loses to likely rock\n\n5.

Recent game history:\n   - Last 4 rounds: Rock(tie) \u2192 Paper(L) \u2192 Rock(L) \u2192 Scissors(L)\n   - Opponent's last 4: Rock(tie) \u2192 Scissors(W) \u2192 Paper(W) \u2192 Rock(W)\n   - They've won three straight rounds\n   - Score now at +2 points (momentum strongly with opponent)\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - I'm in a three-round losing streak\n   - Opponent has perfectly countered my last three moves\n   - They're showing excellent prediction skills\n   - My moves have become readable\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - Opponent has strong momentum and confidence\n   - They've reduced my lead from +8 to +2\n   - I'm showing signs of tilt in my decisions\n   - Need to reset mentally and break their momentum\n\n4. Risk assessment:\n   - After three straight wins, opponent might:\n     * Stay aggressive with their successful strategy\n     * Play more conservatively to protect their momentum\n     * Expect me to make desperate moves\n     * Continue trying to read my patterns\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Scissors would be too risky after just losing with it\n   - Rock might be expected as a defensive recovery play\n   - I'll choose paper because:\n     * Breaks my recent pattern\n     * They might play rock again after success\n     * Higher reward potential (+3) could help recover\n     * Need to show unpredictability\n     * They might expect me to avoid paper after recent losses\n     * Must take calculated risks to break their momentum\n     * Even if they predict this, maintaining aggressive play is necessary\n\n[move] paper\n"
