    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move with no prior information:\n   - Playing paper is high-risk, high-reward\n   - Rock is a solid defensive choice\n   - Scissors might be predictable as a first move\n\n5. Given that paper has the highest potential payoff and new players often start with rock, I'll choose paper.\n\n[move] paper I'm choosing paper as it offers the highest potential gain (+3) and many players tend to start with rock in RPS games.\n"

            "text": "Let me think about this step by step:\n\n1. Complete game history:\n   - Current total: +1 points\n   - Their recent moves: scissors, scissors, scissors, scissors\n   - They've now played scissors FOUR times in a row\n   - This is their longest scissors streak in the game\n\n2. Pattern analysis:\n   - Four consecutive scissors is extreme\n   - Previous long scissors streaks ended in paper traps\n   - But this could also show they're becoming predictable\n   - They might be trying to condition my response\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - The tie maintained status quo\n   - They're still trailing by 1 point\n   - They might be:\n     * Stuck in a comfort pattern\n     * Setting up another trap\n     * Getting frustrated\n   - Four same moves suggests possible tilt\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Rock vs scissors: +1 (obvious counter)\n   - Paper vs rock: +3 (if they make big switch)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 (safe but doesn't help them)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Four scissors in a row is unprecedented\n   - They need to make up points\n   - They've previously punished predictable counters\n   - But they might also be genuinely stuck\n   - This feels different from previous patterns due to length\n\n[move] rock I'm choosing rock because four consecutive scissors moves is excessive even for their pattern-setting behavior. While they've punished predictable rock before, this many scissors plays suggests they might be genuinely stuck in a pattern rather than setting a trap.\n"
