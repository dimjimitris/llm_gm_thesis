    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

For a first move with no prior information:\n- Going with Paper has highest potential gain but also highest risk\n- Rock and Scissors are safer options with lower risk/reward\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I'll play conservatively and avoid the high-risk option (Paper).\n- Between Rock and Scissors, Rock is traditionally a common first move for many players\n- I'll choose Scissors to potentially counter Paper if they use it, while accepting the risk against Rock\n\n[move] Scissors - Starting with a balanced risk-reward option against a new player\n"

Complete game history analysis:\n- Round 1-8: Strong winning streak\n- Round 9: Scissors vs Scissors (Tie)\n- Round 10: Paper vs Paper (Tie)\n- Round 11: Scissors vs Rock (Lost, -1)\n- Total score: +8 points\n- First loss in several rounds\n\n2. Recent pattern analysis:\n- Two ties followed by my loss\n- Opponent finally broke their losing streak\n- They successfully predicted and countered my move\n- They've shown improvement in reading my strategy\n\n3. Psychological assessment:\n- Opponent has momentum shift after recent success\n- They've demonstrated better prediction ability\n- They might be more confident now\n- Common behavior after winning with Rock:\n   a) Stick with winning move (Rock)\n   b) Expect me to play Paper to counter Rock\n   c) Switch to Scissors to counter expected Paper\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n- If they stick with Rock: Paper wins (+3)\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins (+1)\n- If they switch to Paper: Scissors wins (+1)\n- Most risky move is Paper (-3 if they predict it)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n- Given their recent success\n- And their improved prediction ability\n- They're most likely to switch to Scissors because:\n   - It's the logical counter to my expected Paper\n   - They'll want to maintain momentum\n   - It's a safer play than sticking with Rock\n- Therefore, Rock is optimal:\n   - Beats their likely Scissors play\n   - Safe against another Rock (tie)\n   - Acceptable risk against Paper (-3 but less likely)\n\n[move] Rock - Anticipating opponent's switch to Scissors after their Rock success\n"

Psychological assessment:\n- They just succeeded with Paper (+3)\n- They reversed my previous +3 win\n- They've shown strong adaptive strategy\n- Their confidence likely high after big win\n- Common behavior after +3 win:\n  * Stay with winning move\n  * Expect counter to winning move\n  * Play more confidently/aggressively\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\nAfter winning with Paper, they might:\n- Expect me to play Scissors to counter Paper\n- Consider staying with Paper as it just worked\n- Play Rock to counter expected Scissors\nKey insight: They've shown good prediction ability\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Their perspective:\n  * Just won big with Paper\n  * I'm likely to counter with Scissors\n  * Rock would be safe against Scissors\n- Given their recent success and adaptation:\n  * They're likely to predict my Scissors counter\n  * They'll probably play Rock to beat expected Scissors\n  * Paper would be too obvious a repeat\n- Therefore, Paper is optimal:\n  * Beats their likely Rock play\n  * They won't expect me to mirror their winning move\n  * Worth risk as they're unlikely to play Scissors\n  * Double-Paper would be too obvious for them\n\n[move] Paper - Anticipating Rock counter to expected Scissors after their Paper success\n"

Psychological assessment:\n- I'm on a two-round losing streak\n- They've built momentum\n- They've just won with Scissors again\n- My recent Paper plays have been costly\n- They've successfully read my strategy\n\n4. Strategic calculation:\nAfter winning with Scissors, they might:\n- Stay with Scissors because:\n  * It's worked twice\n  * They might expect another Paper\n  * I seem predictable with Paper\n- Switch to Rock because:\n  * Natural progression after Scissors\n  * Safe against potential Scissors counter\n- Paper would be their riskiest play\n\n5. Decision making:\n- Given their success with Scissors\n- And my recent predictability\n- They're likely to either:\n  * Stay with successful Scissors\n  * Play Rock expecting me to counter Scissors\n- Rock is optimal because:\n  * Beats Scissors if they stay with winning move\n  * Safe against their Rock (tie)\n  * I must break my Paper pattern\n  * They're unlikely to play Paper after Scissors success\n  * Need to play more defensively after losses\n\n[move] Rock - Breaking Paper pattern and countering potential continued Scissors success\n"
