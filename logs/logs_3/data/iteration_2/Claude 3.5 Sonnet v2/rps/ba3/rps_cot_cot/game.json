For a first move with no prior information:\n- Going with Paper has highest potential gain but also highest risk\n- Rock and Scissors are safer options with lower risk/reward\n\n5. Since this is the first round, I'll play conservatively and avoid the high-risk option (Paper).\n- Between Rock and Scissors, Rock is traditionally a common first move for many players\n- I'll choose Scissors to potentially counter Paper if they use it, while accepting the risk against Rock\n\n[move] Scissors - Starting with a balanced risk-reward option against a new player\n"

Psychological assessment:\n- Opponent has found their rhythm\n- They're successfully reading my strategy\n- They've gained confidence\n- I'm potentially becoming predictable\n- Need to break their momentum\n\n4.

Decision making:\n- Need to break my own pattern\n- Must account for opponent's improved gameplay\n- They've used Rock and Paper in last two rounds\n- Scissors is their most logical next move because:\n   - It's the only move they haven't used recently\n   - It counters the most obvious counter to their Paper\n- Therefore, Rock is optimal:\n   - Beats their likely Scissors play\n   - Breaks my recent pattern\n   - Even if wrong, better to lose 3 points than keep being predictable\n\n[move] Rock - Breaking pattern and countering expected Scissors while accepting Paper risk\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
