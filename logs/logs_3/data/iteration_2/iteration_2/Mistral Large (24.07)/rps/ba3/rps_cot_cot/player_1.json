    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since it\u2019s a fresh player, their strategy might be random or predictable.\n   - Choosing 'Paper' could be a good initial move because it yields 3 points if the opponent chooses Rock, a common starting choice.\n\n3. **Adaptive Strategy**:\n   - After the first round, adapt based on the opponent's move. If they chose Rock, they might switch to Paper or Scissors next.\n   - If they chose Scissors, they might switch to Rock or Paper. Adjust accordingly.\n   - If they chose Paper, they might choose Rock or Scissors next.\n\n4. **Following Rounds**:\n   - Continue to adapt based on the opponent's previous moves. Look for patterns or repetitions.\n\n### Making the First Move:\nGiven the above points, it makes sense to start with 'Paper' to maximize potential gains or minimize losses.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Paper (To counter the common starting choice of Rock and maximize potential points if successful.)\n"

A common strategy after a tie might be to switch to Rock, anticipating that you might choose Scissors.\n\n3. **Optimal Counter Move**:\n   - If you predict that the opponent will choose Rock, the best counter is 'Paper' to secure 3 points.\n   - If you predict they will choose Scissors, 'Rock' would be the optimal move, securing 1 point.\n\n4. **Consider the Payoff**:\n   - Choosing 'Paper' has a higher potential reward (3 points) compared to 'Rock' (1 point).\n\n5. **Risk and Reward Assessment**:\n   - If the opponent chooses 'Scissors', choosing 'Paper' again would result in a loss of 1 point. However, this is less severe compared to choosing 'Rock' and losing 3 points if the opponent chooses 'Paper'.\n\n### Making the Next Move:\nGiven the above points, it makes sense to go with 'Rock' to minimize the potential loss and possibly gain 1 point if the opponent indeed chooses Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock (To counter a potential switch to Scissors by the opponent and minimize the risk of a significant point loss.)\n"
