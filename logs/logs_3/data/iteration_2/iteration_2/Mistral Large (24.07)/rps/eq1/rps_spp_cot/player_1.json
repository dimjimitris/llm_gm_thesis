    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the optimal strategy against a fresh player:\n   - Since this is the first round and the other player is fresh, there is no historical data to base a prediction on.\n   - A common strategy in Rock-Paper-Scissors is to start with a safe option. Rock is often considered a balanced choice because it can beat scissors and can be beaten by paper, both of which are common choices.\n\n3. Make the move:\n   - Given the lack of information about the opponent's tendencies, choosing rock seems like a reasonable starting point.\n\n[move] Rock (Choosing rock as a balanced starting move against a fresh player)\n"

            "text": "### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix**:\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 point for Rock, -1 point for Scissors).\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 point for Paper, -1 point for Rock).\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 point for Scissors, -1 point for Paper).\n   - Same move results in a tie (no points awarded).\n\n2. **Review Previous Round**:\n   - In the last round, I made the move Scissors and the opponent made the move Rock.\n   - I lost the round and scored -1 point.\n\n3. **Consider Opponent's Strategy**:\n   - The opponent chose Rock last round. They might follow a pattern or try to anticipate my next move to maintain their advantage.\n   - A common strategy might be to expect me to play Paper if I expect them to repeat Rock.\n\n4. **Estimate Probabilities**:\n   - The opponent might switch to Paper to anticipate my move of Rock.\n   - Alternatively, they could stick with Rock or choose Scissors, but the probabilities are uncertain.\n\n5. **Optimal Strategy**:\n   - If the opponent switches to Paper or Scissors, choosing Rock is safe.\n   - If the opponent repeats Rock, it results in a tie.\n\n6. **Make the Move**:\n   - Based on the anticipation that the opponent might switch to Paper, choosing Rock seems like a strategic move to minimize losses.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The opponent might switch to Paper to counter the previous win with Rock.\n- Choosing Rock would tie with Rock and beat Scissors, minimizing losses.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Choosing Rock to minimize losses) Rock\n"
