    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Here are the steps I will take to decide my move:\n\n1. **Understand the Payoff Matrix:**\n   - Rock beats Scissors (+1 point for rock, -1 point for scissors)\n   - Paper beats Rock (+1 point for paper, -1 point for rock)\n   - Scissors beats Paper (+1 point for scissors, -1 point for paper)\n   - Tie (no points)\n\n2. **Assume the Opponent Makes Random Moves:**\n   Since there is no prior information about the opponent's strategy, assume the opponent will choose rock, paper, or scissors with equal probability (1/3 chance for each).\n\n3. **Determine the Effectiveness of Each Move:**\n   - If I choose Rock:\n     - Beats Scissors (1/3 chance, +1 point)\n     - Loses to Paper (1/3 chance, -1 point)\n     - Ties with Rock (1/3 chance, 0 points)\n   - If I choose Paper:\n     - Beats Rock (1/3 chance, +1 point)\n     - Loses to Scissors (1/3 chance, -1 point)\n     - Ties with Paper (1/3 chance, 0 points)\n   - If I choose Scissors:\n     - Beats Paper (1/3 chance, +1 point)\n     - Loses to Rock (1/3 chance, -1 point)\n     - Ties with Scissors (1/3 chance, 0 points)\n\n4. **Maximize Expected Points:**\n   Given that each move has the same expected outcome (equal chances of winning, losing, or tying), there is no strategic advantage to choosing one move over another if the opponent is making random moves.\n\n5. **Randomize the Move:**\n   Since all moves are equally probable to win or lose against a random opponent, I will choose my move randomly to avoid predictability.\n\n6. **Make the Move:**\n   Randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors.\n\n[move] I will choose Scissors.\n\nExplanation: Given that all choices have the same expected outcome against a random opponent, picking Scissors ensures a balanced strategy for the initial move.\n"

If the opponent tends to repeat moves, choosing Rock could be a strategic advantage.\n   - Alternatively, if the opponent switches to Rock or Paper, choosing Paper or Scissors accordingly could also be beneficial.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Expected Outcomes:**\n   - **If the opponent repeats Scissors:**\n     - Choosing Rock will result in a win (+1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent).\n   - **If the opponent switches to Rock:**\n     - Choosing Paper will result in a win (+1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent).\n   - **If the opponent switches to Paper:**\n     - Choosing Scissors will result in a win (+1 point for me, -1 point for the opponent).\n\n5. **Optimize Decision Based on Limited Information:**\n   - Given the opponent's previous move of Scissors, assuming they might repeat is a reasonable strategy.\n   - Choosing Rock maximizes potential gains based on the opponent's possible repeat while risking a loss if the opponent switches to Paper.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n[move] (Choosing Rock based on the potential of the opponent repeating Scissors or switching to Paper) Rock\n"
