    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since we have no information about the opponent's tendencies, a good starting point is to make a random choice among the three moves. This ensures that the opponent cannot easily predict our moves.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: Given that the opponent is a fresh player, they might not have a established pattern yet. However, some new players tend to start with 'rock' as it's often perceived as a strong initial move. We could consider this, but also remember that it's just a possibility.\n\n**Game Statistician**: Without any historical data, we can't provide any statistical probabilities. However, as the game progresses, we can keep track of the opponent's moves and look for any patterns or frequencies.\n\nBased on the input from the personas, let's make our first move.\n\n[move] I'll start with 'paper' to potentially counter the opponent's possible 'rock' strategy.

We need to consider both possibilities.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: The opponent tied with 'rock' last time. They might choose 'rock' again, thinking we might change our move. Alternatively, they could switch to 'paper' to counter a potential 'rock' from us.\n\n**Game Statistician**: Without extensive historical data, we can only rely on basic probabilities. Each move has an equal chance, but considering the opponent's recent choice and potential counter-strategy, 'rock' or 'paper' seems likely.\n\nBased on the input from the personas, let's make our next move.\n\n[move] (Considering the opponent might choose 'rock' again or switch to 'paper', let's counter with 'paper' to potentially gain a point.)

The opponent chose 'rock' last time, which they might repeat or switch.\n\n**Opponent Analyst**: Based on the limited data, the opponent chose 'rock' in the last round. They might choose 'rock' again or switch to 'paper' to counter a potential 'rock' from us.\n\n**Game Statistician**: Without extensive historical data, we can only rely on basic probabilities. Each move has an equal chance, but considering the opponent's recent choice and potential counter-strategy, 'rock' or 'paper' seems likely.\n\nBased on the input from the personas, let's make our next move.\n\n[move] (Considering the opponent might choose 'rock' again or switch to 'paper', let's counter with 'scissors' to potentially gain a point.)
