Thus, if the opponent chose \"rock,\" they're less likely to choose it again immediately.\n\n5. **Next Move Selection**:\n   - Given that \"rock\" was chosen by the opponent, there's a chance they may switch to \"paper\" or \"scissors.\"\n   - Choosing \"scissors\" would beat \"paper,\" and choosing \"rock\" would beat \"scissors.\"\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - I'll choose \"scissors\" as my next move.
