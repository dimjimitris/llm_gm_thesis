    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Here's a step-by-step thought process to make a move:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics:**\n   - Paper wins against Scissors.\n   - Rock wins against Paper.\n   - Scissors wins against Rock.\n   - Ties result in no points awarded.\n\n2. **Consider the Opponent:**\n   - Since the opponent is a fresh player, there is no previous data to rely on. Thus, I should make an initial assumption about their strategy.\n\n3. **Basic Strategy and Payoff Matrix Analysis:**\n   - Each move has an equal chance of winning, losing, or tying.\n   - With no data, starting with a balanced strategy (i.e., choosing randomly) is a reasonable approach.\n   - I should pick a move that is unpredictable to prevent easy patterns that the opponent can exploit.\n\n4. **First Move Decision:**\n   - To maximize randomness and avoid predictability, I will choose one of the moves randomly.\n   - I'll start with \"Rock.\"\n\n5. **Execute the Move:**\n   - Make the move and observe the outcome.\n\nFinal decision:\n[move] Rock\n\nBy following this thought process, I ensure that I'm making a balanced and unpredictable initial move, which is crucial when facing an unknown opponent.\n"

Here\u2019s a step-by-step thought process:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Review Previous Round:**\n   - In the last round, I chose \"Paper,\" and my opponent chose \"Scissors.\"\n   - Result: I won and scored 1 point.\n\n2. **Analyze Opponent's Potential Strategy:**\n   - The opponent chose \"Scissors\" and lost the previous round.\n   - The opponent might anticipate that I will repeat \"Paper\" to continue my winning streak.\n   - Alternatively, they might switch to \"Rock\" to counter a potential repeat of \"Paper.\"\n\n3. **Predict the Opponent's Next Move:**\n   - If the opponent expects me to repeat \"Paper,\" they might choose \"Rock\" to counter it.\n   - If the opponent expects me to switch to \"Rock\" to counter \"Scissors,\" they might choose \"Paper\" to counter \"Rock.\"\n\n4. **Optimize My Next Move:**\n   - Considering the opponent's potential strategies, choosing \"Scissors\" would counter a potential switch to \"Paper\" by the opponent.\n   - This move anticipates the opponent's likely strategy based on their previous choice of \"Scissors\" and the possibility of them countering a repeat of \"Paper.\"\n\n5. **Make a Strategic Choice:**\n   - Based on the above reasoning, I will choose \"Scissors\" to maximize my chances of winning the next round.\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (The opponent might choose \"Rock\" to counter \"Paper\" or switch to \"Paper\" to counter \"Rock,\" so I will choose) Scissors\n"
