    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The opponent might now switch to scissors, thinking we'll choose rock again. Let's consider this possibility and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n**Statistician:** Here's the updated data:\n- Previous round: We chose rock, opponent chose paper (We won +3)\n\nThe opponent seems to be reacting to our previous moves.\n\n**Psychologist:** The opponent might be trying to counter our last move. If they think we'll choose rock again, they might switch to scissors. We should anticipate this and adjust our strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Thanks for the insights. Let's anticipate the opponent's next move and make a strategic decision. Here's our next move:\n[move] (Anticipating the opponent might choose scissors, we choose rock) Rock\n\n**Game Strategist:** Good choice. Rock beats scissors and loses to paper. If the opponent chooses scissors, we win. If they choose paper, we lose.\n\n**Statistician:** Let's continue tracking the moves to stay ahead of the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Psychologist:** By predicting the opponent's next move, we can stay one step ahead and maximize our points. Let's observe their reaction to our strategy.\n\n**End of Round. Please continue the collaboration based on the outcome of the round.**\n"

This suggests that the opponent might be cautious or following a common opening move. Let's change our move to gather more information about their strategy.\n\n**Statistician:** We should keep track of the opponent's moves to identify any patterns. Currently, the opponent has chosen rock once. Diversifying our moves will help us understand their strategy better.\n\n**Psychologist:** The opponent's choice of rock could indicate they are playing defensively or trying to understand our strategy as well. Changing our move can help us observe their response and deduce their strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (you):** Thanks for the advice. Let's change our move to see how the opponent responds. Here's our next move:\n[move] (Changing to paper to see how the opponent responds) Paper\n\n**Game Strategist:** Good move. Paper can beat rock and lose to scissors. Let's see how the opponent reacts to this change.\n\n**Statistician:** Keeping a record of our moves and the opponent's moves will help us analyze patterns and optimize our future moves.\n\n**Psychologist:** By changing our move, we can observe if the opponent is following a pattern or making random choices. This will give us a better understanding of their approach.\n\n**End of Round 2. Please continue the collaboration based on the outcome of the round.**\n"
