    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

There is no historical data available on the opponent's moves.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Risks and Rewards:**\n   - Choosing Rock has a higher reward (3 points) if it beats Paper but loses less (-1 point) if it loses to Scissors.\n   - Choosing Paper has a lower reward (1 point) if it beats Scissors but loses more (-3 points) if it loses to Rock.\n   - Choosing Scissors has a lower reward (1 point) if it beats Rock but loses less (-1 point) if it loses to Paper.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   - Since this is the first move and there is no forecast on the opponent\u2019s strategy, a balanced approach is to start with a move that has a moderate risk and reward.\n   - Choosing Rock seems reasonable as it provides a potential high reward (3 points) and a moderate penalty (-1 point).\n\nGiven these considerations, I will start with Rock.\n\n[move] I choose Rock as my first move because it provides a balanced risk-reward ratio.\n"

As a result, you lost the round and scored -1 point.\n\n3. **Analyze Opponent's Potential Strategy:**\n   - The opponent chose Paper last time and won.\n   - Possible moves the opponent might consider:\n     - Stick with Paper, expecting you to switch to Rock or Scissors.\n     - Switch to Rock, anticipating you might choose Scissors again or switch to Paper.\n     - Switch to Scissors, hoping to catch you switching to Paper.\n\n4. **Evaluate Your Potential Moves:**\n   - If you choose Rock:\n     - Win: +3 points if the opponent chooses Paper.\n     - Lose: -1 point if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n     - Tie: 0 points if the opponent chooses Rock.\n   - If you choose Paper:\n     - Win: +1 point if the opponent chooses Rock.\n     - Lose: -1 point if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n     - Tie: 0 points if the opponent chooses Paper.\n   - If you choose Scissors:\n     - Win: +1 point if the opponent chooses Paper.\n     - Lose: -1 point if the opponent chooses Rock.\n     - Tie: 0 points if the opponent chooses Scissors.\n\n5. **Formulate a Strategy:**\n   - Given the previous loss with Scissors, the opponent might expect you to switch.\n   - Choosing Rock maximizes potential gain (+3 points if the opponent sticks with Paper) and minimizes the risk of significant loss (-1 point if the opponent switches to Scissors).\n\n### Final Decision:\n[move] (Choosing Rock to potentially gain 3 points against Paper and minimize significant loss) Rock\n"
