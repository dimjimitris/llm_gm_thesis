    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

To maximize points and minimize penalties in this game of rock-paper-scissors, let's identify the personas who could contribute to a winning strategy.\n\n### Personas:\n1. **AI Assistant (you)**: You are the primary decision-maker and will receive hints and suggestions from the other personas.\n2. **Game Analyst**: A persona who understands the game dynamics and can analyze potential strategies based on different scenarios.\n3. **Probability Expert**: A persona who can calculate probabilities and provide advice on the likelihood of certain outcomes.\n4. **Opponent Profiler**: A persona who can formulate predictions based on the opponent's past moves and behaviors.\n\nLet's begin the multi-round collaboration process.\n\n---\n\n**[Round 1]**\n\n### Game Analyst:\nLet's start by considering the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats Rock: 1 point\n- Rock beats Scissors: 3 points\n- Scissors beats Paper: 1 point\n\nYou should consider both the potential gains and the risks associated with each move.\n\n### Probability Expert:\nWithout knowing the opponent's strategy, each move (paper, rock, scissors) has an equal probability of being chosen. Consider starting with a balanced approach.\n\n### Opponent Profiler:\nThis is the first move, so we don't have data on the opponent's behavior yet. Start with a neutral choice to gather information.\n\n**AI Assistant**:\nLet's make a neutral choice to start and observe the opponent's response.\n\n```\n[move] I choose rock to start with a neutral approach.\n```\n\n---\n\n**[Round 2]** Hypothetical opponent's move: paper (just for illustration)\n\n### Game Analyst:\nThe opponent chose paper. This means you lost 3 points. With this information, consider their next move. Often players adjust their strategy after a win.\n\n### Probability Expert:\nGiven the opponent's win, there's a higher probability they might choose rock next to try to win again or use scissors to be unpredictable.\n\n### Opponent Profiler:\nThe opponent might stick with paper to exploit your rock choice. Consider choosing scissors to counter their potential repeat of paper.\n\n**AI Assistant**:\nBased on the analysis, let's choose scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper.\n\n```\n[move] I choose scissors to counter their potential repeat of paper.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Continuing Rounds\n\nYou would continue this process, discussing each round with the personas and adjusting your strategy based on the opponent's moves and the hints received.\n\nRemember to always make a move message as the final step of each round.\n\n---\n\n### Final Example Round\n\n**[Round 3]** Hypothetical opponent's move: scissors (just for illustration)\n\n### Game Analyst:\nThe opponent chose scissors. This means you lost 1 point. They might switch to paper next.\n\n### Probability Expert:\nThere's a higher probability they will switch to paper to expect you to choose rock.\n\n### Opponent Profiler:\nThe opponent is likely to switch to paper next, trying to gain points.\n\n**AI Assistant**:\nBased on the analysis, let's choose scissors to counter their potential switch to paper.\n\n```\n[move] I choose scissors to counter their potential switch to paper.\n```\n\n---\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Continue to play strategically, adjusting moves based on opponent's behavior and collaborative insights from the personas.\n"
