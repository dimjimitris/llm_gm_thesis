Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've now played scissors three times in a row, completely abandoning their previous alternating pattern. This strongly suggests a deliberate strategy shift.\n\n4. Their overall statistics: Paper (1 time), Rock (3 times), Scissors (6 times)\n   Their preference for scissors has increased further, now representing 60% of their moves.\n\n5. After three consecutive scissors moves resulting in ties, they might:\n   - Continue playing scissors, assuming I'll eventually try to counter with paper\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I might play paper to counter their scissors\n   - Play paper, which they've barely used, to surprise me\n\n6. The fact that we've tied with scissors three times consecutively creates psychological pressure to change moves.\n\n7. If they play scissors again, paper would lose me 1 point.\n   If they play rock (anticipating my paper), paper would lose me 3 points.\n   If they play paper, paper would tie for 0 points.\n\n8. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors lately, and the game theory principle that eventually one player must break from a series of ties, I believe they might continue with scissors expecting me to switch.\n\n9. Against their expected scissors, my best counter is rock, which would lose me 1 point if correct.\n\n10. However, since they've shown such a strong commitment to scissors, I'll risk playing paper, anticipating they might finally switch to rock after the series of ties.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Quite surprising! After three consecutive scissors moves, they switched to paper - exactly when I switched to paper as well.\n\n4. Their overall statistics: Paper (2 times), Rock (3 times), Scissors (6 times)\n\n5. They've now abandoned their streak of scissors and moved to paper. This could indicate:\n   - They anticipated my switch to paper and decided to match it for a tie\n   - They're trying to be unpredictable by switching to their least used move\n   - They're using a new pattern or strategy\n\n6. After this mutual switch to paper resulting in a tie, they might:\n   - Return to scissors, their most frequently played move\n   - Play rock, anticipating I might play scissors to beat their expected paper\n   - Continue with paper, thinking I might switch to rock anticipating their scissors\n\n7. Given we just tied with paper, there's psychological pressure for both of us to change moves.\n\n8. If they play scissors (returning to their most common move), rock would lose me 1 point.\n   If they play rock (trying to beat my expected paper), scissors would win me 1 point.\n   If they play paper again, scissors would win me 1 point.\n\n9. Looking at this analysis, scissors would win against both rock and paper, and only lose against scissors. Given their historical preference for scissors, but their recent abandonment of that move, I think scissors is the safest choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their overall statistics: Paper (2 times), Rock (4 times), Scissors (6 times)\n\n4. Interesting development - they played rock in round 12, which resulted in my victory with scissors. This is the third time I've won with scissors against their rock (rounds 3, 7, and now 12).\n\n5. Let's analyze my wins and losses:\n   - I've won 4 rounds: with rock vs paper (round 1), and with scissors vs rock (rounds 3, 7, 12)\n   - I've lost 3 rounds: with rock vs scissors (rounds 2, 4, 8)\n   - We've tied 5 rounds\n\n6. After losing with rock against my scissors, they might:\n   - Play paper to beat my expected scissors\n   - Play scissors to beat my expected paper (if they think I'll switch tactics)\n   - Continue with rock despite having lost with it (persistence or randomness)\n\n7. Given that they've lost to my scissors with rock three times now, they're most likely to anticipate I'll play scissors again and counter with paper.\n\n8. If they play paper (anticipating my scissors), rock would win me 3 points.\n   If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), rock would lose me 1 point.\n   If they play rock again, rock would tie for 0 points.\n\n9. The potential gain of 3 points with rock against their expected paper outweighs the potential loss of 1 point if they play scissors. Given their likely adjustment to counter my successful scissors play, I'll choose rock.\n\n[move] rock\n"

If they play scissors again, paper would lose me 1 point.\n   If they play rock, paper would lose me 3 points.\n   If they play paper, paper would tie for 0 points.\n\n10. Since their most common move is scissors, and they're likely to play it again after a scissors tie, I'll play rock to counter it, which would lose me 1 point if they play scissors.\n\n11.

Their overall statistics: Paper (3 times), Rock (4 times), Scissors (10 times)\n\n4. My prediction was incorrect. They've now played scissors four times in a row (rounds 14-17), further strengthening their preference for this move.\n\n5. Their scissors play has been successful against my rock in rounds 15 and 17, which may reinforce their tendency to continue with scissors.\n\n6. At this point, scissors represents nearly 59% of their total moves, showing a very strong bias.\n\n7. After four consecutive scissors plays and success with it, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors due to its success and their demonstrated preference\n   - Switch to paper anticipating I'll finally adapt and play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Switch to rock as a complete surprise factor\n\n8. Given their overwhelming preference for scissors and recent success with it, I believe they're most likely to continue with scissors.\n\n9. Against their expected scissors, paper would lose me 1 point.\n   Against an unlikely rock play, paper would lose me 3 points.\n   Against an unlikely paper play, paper would tie for 0 points.\n\n10. Since scissors would tie against their most likely move (scissors) and win against the less likely rock, scissors appears to be the safest choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their overall statistics: Paper (3 times), Rock (4 times), Scissors (11 times)\n\n4.

Their preference for scissors has now reached 61% of their total moves, showing an extremely strong bias.\n\n6. After five consecutive scissors plays and multiple ties, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors due to their demonstrated strong preference and commitment\n   - Finally switch to another move, expecting me to adapt to their scissors streak\n   - Use psychology to anticipate that after so many scissors plays, I'll expect them to change\n\n7. The longer a streak continues, the more psychological pressure there is to break it. After 5 consecutive scissors plays, there's increased probability they might switch.\n\n8. If they continue with scissors (most likely based on history), paper would lose me 1 point.\n   If they switch to rock (breaking the pattern), paper would lose me 3 points.\n   If they switch to paper (breaking the pattern), paper would tie for 0 points.\n\n9. Given their overwhelming commitment to scissors, but the psychological pressure to eventually change, I believe they might finally switch to paper (which they haven't used since round 13).\n\n10.

After their previous three-scissors streak (rounds 8-10), they switched to paper. But now they've doubled that streak length without changing.\n\n7. After six consecutive scissors plays resulting in mostly ties (with two wins against my rock attempts), they might:\n   - Continue with scissors due to their extraordinary commitment to this strategy\n   - Finally break the pattern, especially since we've tied for several consecutive rounds\n   - Be deliberately using a strategy of persistent scissors play to condition me\n\n8. The psychological principle that the longer a streak continues, the more likely it is to break, would suggest they might finally change.\n\n9. However, their demonstrated commitment to scissors has been so strong that it overrides conventional game theory expectations.\n\n10.

In the reversed rules of this game:\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1/-1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3/-3 points)\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1/-1 points)\n\n5. By playing rock against their scissors, I lost 1 point as expected by these rules.\n\n6.

Updated complete history:\n   - Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 11: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won 1 point\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper, I won 3 points\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 22: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n   - Round 23: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie with 0 points\n\n2. My opponent's move sequence:\n   - Round 1: Paper\n   - Round 2: Scissors\n   - Round 3: Rock\n   - Round 4: Scissors\n   - Round 5: Rock\n   - Round 6: Scissors\n   - Round 7: Rock\n   - Round 8: Scissors\n   - Round 9: Scissors\n   - Round 10: Scissors\n   - Round 11: Paper\n   - Round 12: Rock\n   - Round 13: Paper\n   - Round 14: Scissors\n   - Round 15: Scissors\n   - Round 16: Scissors\n   - Round 17: Scissors\n   - Round 18: Scissors\n   - Round 19: Scissors\n   - Round 20: Scissors\n   - Round 21: Scissors\n   - Round 22: Scissors\n   - Round 23: Scissors\n\n3. Their overall statistics: Paper (3 times), Rock (4 times), Scissors (16 times)\n\n4. They've now played scissors ten consecutive times (rounds 14-23), which is an extraordinary commitment to a single move.\n\n5. Their preference for scissors has reached 70% of all their plays.\n\n6. This is undoubtedly a deliberate strategy. They've played nothing but scissors for the last 10 rounds, resulting in 8 ties and 2 wins (when I tried rock).\n\n7. At this point, I must consider that:\n   - They are implementing a fixed \"scissors-only\" strategy they intend to maintain indefinitely\n   - They're testing how long I'll continue to match their scissors\n   - They're creating such a strong pattern that when they finally break it, they expect a significant advantage\n\n8. After ten consecutive scissors plays, the game theory principle that patterns eventually break would suggest they might finally change. However, their behavior has consistently defied this expectation.\n\n9. I need to carefully weigh my options:\n\n10. If they continue with scissors (which their 10-round streak strongly suggests):\n    - Paper would lose me 1 point\n    - Rock would lose me 1 point\n    - Scissors would tie for 0 points\n\n11. If they finally break pattern after this extraordinary streak:\n    - Against paper, scissors would win me 1 point\n    - Against rock, scissors would win me 1 point\n\n12. Given their unprecedented commitment to scissors, but also considering the increasing psychological pressure to eventually change, I believe scissors remains my optimal move. It's the only move that doesn't lose against their most likely play (scissors) and wins against their other possible moves.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
