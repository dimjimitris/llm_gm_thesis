The payoffs aren't symmetric:\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner gets 3 points, loser loses 3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner gets 1 point, loser loses 1 point\n   - Ties: 0 points for both players\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I don't have information about their tendencies yet.\n\n3. Looking at the payoff structure, paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) if I win with it. The risk is losing 1 point if my opponent plays scissors.\n\n4. Rock is a safer play with a smaller downside (-3 if I lose) and smaller upside (1 if I win).\n\n5. In standard Rock Paper Scissors, many players tend to choose rock first, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\" If my opponent follows this tendency, paper would be advantageous.\n\n6. Given the asymmetric rewards, paper offers the best risk-reward ratio in the first round.\n\n7. I'll choose paper for my first move, aiming for the higher payoff while I gather information about my opponent.\n\n[move] paper\n"

I need to consider how my opponent might adjust their strategy:\n   - They might anticipate that I'll stick with paper (since it worked) and counter with scissors\n   - They might switch to paper, expecting me to play rock\n   - They might stick with rock, not changing their strategy\n\n4. Most players tend to change their move after losing, so my opponent likely won't play rock again.\n\n5. Given the psychology of this game, after losing to paper, many players would choose scissors next to counter the previous winning move.\n\n6. If my opponent switches to scissors as predicted, my best counter would be rock.\n\n7. Playing rock would give me a win of 1 point if they play scissors, and a loss of 3 points if they play paper.\n\n8.

Looking at my opponent's pattern: they went from rock to scissors, which follows a clockwise rotation in the standard rock-paper-scissors cycle.\n\n4. If they continue this pattern or try to adapt based on their losses, they might:\n   - Follow the clockwise rotation and play paper next\n   - Try to predict my move and counter it\n   - Fall into a psychological trap of trying to \"finally win\" with a move that hasn't been played yet\n\n5.

Updated game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won 3 points.\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 3-8: Six consecutive ties with matching moves.\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost 1 point.\n   - Round 10: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won 1 point.\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points.\n\n2. After the brief period of non-matching (rounds 9-10), we've returned to a tie. This could indicate:\n   - My opponent is adaptively changing strategies\n   - They might be returning to the matching strategy\n   - They genuinely happened to choose the same move as me\n\n3. Their pattern has become more complex and less predictable, shifting between matching and countering strategies.\n\n4. My opponent may be using my own recent moves to inform their decisions. If they're studying my pattern, they might note that I've played scissors and rock in the last two rounds.\n\n5. If they believe I follow patterns, they might expect me to play paper next, completing a cycle of scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, if they've returned to a matching strategy, they would play whatever I choose next.\n\n7. A third possibility is they're still in counter mode but happened to choose rock independently, and will now counter my next expected move.\n\n8. Given these possibilities, I need a move that works well across multiple scenarios.\n\n9. If they're matching, any move results in a tie.\n\n10. If they're countering my expected move (paper), they would play scissors.\n\n11. If they're playing what beats my last move (rock), they would play paper.\n\n12. Since paper appears in one scenario and scissors in another, rock would be the most robust choice - it would beat scissors and tie with rock.\n\n13. However, given the higher payoff structure for winning with paper (3 points), and the possibility they might play rock again, I'll take a calculated risk with paper.\n\n[move] paper\n"

We've now had ties in the last two rounds, suggesting a possible return to the matching pattern that dominated rounds 3-8.\n\n3. However, this could also be coincidental, as rock and paper are common choices in general.\n\n4. Looking at the broader pattern:\n   - After six consecutive ties, they broke the pattern by countering my repeated paper with scissors\n   - This was followed by them playing paper (possibly expecting rock from me)\n   - Then we've had two consecutive ties again\n\n5. This suggests they might be alternating between matching and prediction strategies.\n\n6. If they're back to matching, they'll play whatever I play next.\n\n7. If they're trying to predict and counter, they might expect me to play scissors next (completing the rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle) and counter with rock.\n\n8. Based on our history, they seem to adapt their strategy after periods of stability.\n\n9. The safest approach would be to assume they're in prediction mode after two ties, expecting me to play scissors.\n\n10. If they're expecting scissors from me and planning to counter with rock, my best response would be paper.\n\n11. Alternatively, if they're in matching mode, any move would result in a tie.\n\n12.

Looking at rounds 9-13:\n   - Round 9: They broke the matching pattern by countering my paper with scissors\n   - Rounds 10-12: Mix of outcomes\n   - Round 13: They once again countered my paper with scissors\n\n3. This suggests they might be specifically watching for me to play paper, and then countering it with scissors.\n\n4. Importantly, both times I've lost points (rounds 9 and 13) have been when I played paper and they countered with scissors.\n\n5. They seem to be willing to match some moves (rock and paper in rounds 11-12), but they specifically counter when I play paper.\n\n6. This could be a deliberate strategy targeting the highest-value move (paper wins give 3 points).\n\n7. If they're specifically watching for paper plays to counter, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors, expecting me to play paper again\n   - Switch to rock, anticipating I might play scissors to counter their scissors\n   - Return to matching if I play rock\n\n8. Given their apparent focus on countering paper specifically, I should avoid playing paper for now.\n\n9. The safest play would be rock, which would beat their scissors if they continue with that play.\n\n10.

The opponent's recent sequence has been paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which doesn't show a clear pattern.\n\n5. The tie with paper suggests several possibilities:\n   - They correctly anticipated my paper play\n   - They independently decided to play paper\n   - They've returned to matching my moves\n\n6. After the tie, they might expect me to:\n   - Switch to scissors (to beat their expected repeated paper)\n   - Play rock (breaking away from paper after the tie)\n   - Stick with paper (thinking they'll switch)\n\n7. Given our history of extended matching periods, there's a possibility they've returned to matching my moves.\n\n8. If they're matching, they'll play whatever I play next.\n\n9. If they're predicting based on my recent plays, they might expect scissors from me (to beat their paper) and counter with rock.\n\n10. After a tie, many players tend to switch moves rather than repeat.\n\n11. Given these considerations, they're more likely to expect me to switch to scissors and prepare a rock counter.\n\n12. To counter their likely rock play, paper would be my optimal choice.\n\n13. Additionally, by playing paper again, I can test whether they've returned to a matching strategy (which would result in another tie).\n\n[move] paper\n"
