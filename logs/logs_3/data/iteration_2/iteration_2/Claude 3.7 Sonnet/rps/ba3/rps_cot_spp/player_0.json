Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (3 points) but also carries the highest risk (losing 3 points if opponent plays scissors).\n\n4. Since this is the first round with a new player, I need a balanced approach.\n\n5. Rock is a reasonable starting move since:\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n6. However, paper has the highest potential gain (3 points)\n   - If opponent plays rock, I win 3 points\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I lose 1 point\n   - If opponent plays paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\n7.

This gives me some information about their initial strategy - they chose paper like I did.\n\n3. Now I need to predict what they might do next. Common rock-paper-scissors psychology suggests:\n   - Players who tie often switch to what would have beaten their previous move\n   - My opponent might think I'll stick with paper or switch to scissors\n\n4. If my opponent played paper first, they might now:\n   - Switch to scissors (expecting me to play paper again)\n   - Switch to rock (thinking I'll switch to scissors)\n   - Stick with paper (if they're unpredictable or think I'll switch to rock)\n\n5. Let's analyze my options:\n   - If I play rock: I beat their scissors (+1), lose to their paper (-3), tie with their rock (0)\n   - If I play paper: I beat their rock (+3), lose to their scissors (-1), tie with their paper (0)\n   - If I play scissors: I beat their paper (+1), lose to their rock (-1), tie with their scissors (0)\n\n6. Since many players switch after a tie, and scissors beats the previous move (paper), scissors seems like a reasonable choice.\n\n7. If they're following basic pattern-breaking strategy, they may switch to scissors, in which case playing rock would be best for me.\n\n8.

Looking at the pattern so far:\n   - We both started with paper\n   - We both switched to rock\n   - This could indicate similar thinking patterns or strategic approaches\n\n4. In rock-paper-scissors psychology, after two consecutive ties, players often:\n   - Try to break the pattern completely\n   - Follow what seems like a logical progression\n\n5. If my opponent is thinking similarly to me, they might expect me to play paper next (to beat their anticipated rock).\n\n6.

Let's reconsider the payoff structure:\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 point\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 point\n\n8. If I play paper, I risk losing 1 point if they play scissors, but could gain 3 points if they stick with rock.\n\n9.

Another approach is to play what would have beaten my previous move, as my opponent might expect me to play what would beat their previous move.\n\n10. They've just played paper, and if they expect me to play scissors to counter it, they might play rock.\n\n11. If I expect them to play rock, I should play paper.\n\n12. However, given their consistent success in predicting my moves, I should not be too predictable.\n\n13. Since I've lost with all three moves recently, I'll choose scissors, which:\n    - Would beat paper if they repeat it\n    - Would lose to rock if they play that\n    - Would tie with scissors if they play that\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My opponent has played rock in rounds 2, 7, and 10. I notice they've played rock after I won rounds (rounds 3-4), and now they seem to be alternating more frequently with rock.\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (4 times), rock (3 times), scissors (3 times)\n\n5. Looking at their last three moves (scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock), they've cycled through all three options again, making a pattern harder to detect.\n\n6. Given that they just played rock, they might:\n   - Play paper next (following a pattern they've shown several times)\n   - Play scissors (if they're trying to counter what they think I'll play)\n   - Play rock again (if they think I'll overthink)\n\n7. At this point, I need to be unpredictable and break whatever pattern they've detected in my play.\n\n8. The fact that I've lost six straight rounds suggests they're not playing randomly but are successfully predicting my choices.\n\n9. Given their apparent success at prediction, I should consider what they might expect me to do. After they play rock, the obvious move for me is paper.\n\n10. But if they anticipate me playing paper, they'll play scissors.\n\n11. Since they might expect me to play paper (to beat their rock), I could play rock instead, anticipating their scissors.\n\n12. However, this type of thinking has led to my losing streak, so I need to change my approach.\n\n13. Looking at the game from a fresh perspective, I notice I haven't played paper in the last two rounds. Using paper here introduces some variability.\n\n14. I'll play paper, which:\n    - Beats rock if they repeat it\n    - Loses to scissors if they anticipate this move\n    - Ties with paper if they play that\n\n[move] paper\n"

Their last three moves (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) complete a cycle through all three options again.\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (4 times), rock (3 times), scissors (4 times)\n\n5.

Another approach is to play what would beat their previous move, as they might expect me to continue changing strategies.\n\n11. Since they just played scissors, I could play rock to beat it, but that might be what they expect.\n\n12. I'll play rock anyway because:\n    - It would have beaten their last move (scissors)\n    - If they're following a pattern and play paper next, I would lose\n    - If they anticipate rock and play paper, I would lose\n    - If they play scissors again or play rock, I would tie or win\n\n13.

Looking at their last few moves, I notice they have played paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper in a somewhat consistent pattern.\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (5 times), rock (3 times), scissors (4 times)\n\n5. There seems to be a pattern in their play:\n   - After playing scissors, they often play paper (3/4 times)\n   - After playing rock, they often play scissors (2/3 times)\n   - After playing paper, they've played scissors (2/4 times) or rock (2/4 times)\n\n6.

I also notice that whenever I've played scissors recently, they've countered with rock.

Given all these considerations, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play paper (following one of their patterns), I'll win\n    - If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'll lose\n    - If they play scissors, we'll tie\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Another approach is to simply choose the same move repeatedly, which might disrupt their strategy or make it harder for them to predict variations.\n\n10. Since they just played rock, one simple strategy would be to play paper, which beats rock.\n\n11. However, if they're successfully predicting my moves (which seems likely given nine straight losses), they would expect me to play paper and counter with scissors.\n\n12. Given my consistent losing streak, I'll try a completely different approach and play paper for two consecutive rounds:\n    - If they play rock (repeating their last move), I'll win\n    - If they play paper, we'll tie\n    - If they play scissors (anticipating my paper), I'll lose\n\n13.

Their last several moves confirm a pattern: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (6 times), rock (5 times), scissors (6 times) - very balanced\n\n5. I was right about their pattern! They did play scissors after rock, following the rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper pattern I observed.\n\n6. Given that they just played scissors, and following their established pattern, they should play paper next.\n\n7. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n8. Let's verify this pattern again:\n   - After rounds 2-3: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After rounds 7-8: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After rounds 9-11: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After rounds 12-14: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n   - After rounds 15-17: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\n9. The pattern rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper seems quite consistent in recent rounds.\n\n10. Given this analysis, I'm confident that my opponent will play paper in this round, following their scissors move.\n\n11. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They've now played rock twice in a row, breaking their previous pattern.\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (6 times), rock (6 times), scissors (6 times) - perfectly balanced now\n\n5. This could indicate:\n   - They've noticed I detected their pattern and are now changing it\n   - They're adapting their strategy based on my recent win\n   - The pattern was coincidental rather than intentional\n\n6. Since they just played rock, they might:\n   - Play scissors (returning to their previous pattern)\n   - Play rock again (continuing their new approach)\n   - Play paper (trying something different)\n\n7. At this point, after my first win was followed by a loss, I need to reconsider my strategy.\n\n8. If they've played rock twice in a row, they might play rock a third time, thinking I wouldn't expect that.\n\n9. Or they might return to their pattern and play scissors.\n\n10. Given their adaptability shown throughout the game, I'll play paper:\n    - If they play rock again, I'll win\n    - If they return to their pattern and play scissors, I'll lose\n    - If they play paper, we'll tie\n\n11. This choice acknowledges the uncertainty while still giving me a chance to win if they continue with rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Given that they just played scissors, and based on their more frequent patterns, they might play paper next.\n\n7. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\n8. However, given that they've adapted their strategy before (playing rock twice in a row), they might anticipate this and play rock instead.\n\n9. Let's look at what happened after they played scissors previously:\n   - After round 3: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After round 5: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After round 8: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After round 11: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After round 14: scissors \u2192 paper\n   - After round 17: scissors \u2192 rock (broke pattern)\n\n10. Interestingly, after they played scissors in round 17, they broke their pattern and played rock instead of paper. This happened right after I won a round.\n\n11. Given that they broke their pattern once before after I won, but otherwise consistently played paper after scissors, I'll predict they'll play paper this time.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play scissors to counter their expected paper move.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

I correctly predicted they would return to their pattern of playing paper after scissors, which they did.\n\n6. Now, given that they just played paper, based on their patterns throughout the game, they would typically play:\n   - Rock (if following their paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors pattern)\n   - Scissors (if they're adapting to my recent success)\n\n7. Looking at what happened after they played paper previously:\n   - After rounds 1, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15: paper \u2192 rock or scissors\n\n8. There's no consistent pattern after paper - sometimes they play rock, sometimes scissors.\n\n9. However, there's an important consideration: I've just won another round. The last time I won (round 17), they broke their pattern in the following round.\n\n10. Given that I've just won, they might anticipate me expecting rock (following their paper) and instead play scissors to counter my expected paper.\n\n11. But they could also stick to their pattern and play rock after paper.\n\n12. Given the inconsistency after paper moves and my recent win potentially triggering a change in their strategy, I'll play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (breaking pattern after my win), I'll win\n    - If they play paper (repeating their move), I'll lose\n    - If they play rock (following their pattern), we'll tie\n\n[move] rock\n"

Now I've won again, they might:\n   - Play paper (returning to their typical pattern after scissors)\n   - Play rock (to counter my potential scissors play, expecting me to follow their pattern)\n   - Play scissors again (to be unpredictable)\n\n10. Given that I've won two rounds in a row, they're likely to shift their strategy significantly.\n\n11.

Their last several moves: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (8 times), rock (6 times), scissors (8 times)\n\n5. After their two scissors plays in a row, they've now played paper, which is what I would have expected based on their earlier patterns.\n\n6. Given that we just tied with both playing paper, what might they do next?\n\n7. Looking at their moves after paper throughout the game:\n   - Round 1\u21922: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 4\u21925: paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 6\u21927: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 9\u219210: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 12\u219213: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 15\u219216: paper \u2192 rock\n   - Round 20\u219221: paper \u2192 scissors\n\n8. They've played rock after paper 5 times and scissors after paper 2 times. Rock is more common.\n\n9. However, our most recent tie might prompt them to change strategy. After our previous ties:\n   - Round 1\u21922: tie \u2192 rock (they played rock)\n   - Round 2\u21923: tie \u2192 scissors (they played scissors)\n\n10. Given these considerations, I think they're more likely to play rock after paper, but they've also shown a willingness to break patterns, especially after ties or after I win.\n\n11. Therefore, I'll play scissors:\n    - If they play paper again, I'll win\n    - If they play rock (their more common move after paper), I'll lose\n    - If they play scissors, we'll tie\n\n12. This is a calculated risk, but given their tendency to sometimes be unpredictable after significant game events (like ties or my wins), playing scissors gives me a chance to win if they repeat paper.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Their last several moves: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n4. Their overall frequency: paper (8 times), rock (7 times), scissors (8 times)\n\n5. This now reinforces their pattern of often playing rock after paper, which they've now done 6 out of 8 times.\n\n6. Given that they just played rock, what might they do next?\n\n7. Looking at their moves after rock throughout the game:\n   - Round 2\u21923: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 7\u21928: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 10\u219211: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 13\u219214: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 16\u219217: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 18\u219219: rock \u2192 scissors\n   - Round 23\u2192?: rock \u2192 ?\n\n8. They've played scissors after rock 6 out of 6 times - a perfect pattern.\n\n9. Given this very strong pattern, they're highly likely to play scissors after their rock move.\n\n10. To counter scissors, I should play rock.\n\n11. Of course, they might break this pattern, especially if they've noticed that I've detected it. But the statistical evidence is very strong - they've never broken this rock \u2192 scissors pattern.\n\n12. Therefore, I'll play rock:\n    - If they play scissors (following their consistent pattern), I'll win\n    - If they break pattern and play paper, I'll lose\n    - If they break pattern and play rock, we'll tie\n\n[move] rock\n"
