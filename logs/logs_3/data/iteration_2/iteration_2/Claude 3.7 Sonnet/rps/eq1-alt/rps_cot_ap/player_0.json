Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Updated complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock - tie (0)\n   - Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 7: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 14: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper - I won (+1)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 18: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I won (+1)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock - I lost (-1)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I won (+1)\n\n2. Revised pattern analysis:\n   - The opponent has now played rock for 2 consecutive rounds\n   - They've returned to their original preferred move (rock)\n   - This follows 3 rounds of scissors (breaking their earlier 7-round pattern)\n   - My current overall score is +9 points\n\n3. Pattern reassessment:\n   - Their initial pattern was rigid (7 rounds each of rock, then paper)\n   - But they broke pattern after 3 rounds of scissors, returning to rock\n   - This suggests they may be becoming more adaptive or unpredictable\n   - However, they've shown strong preference for rock throughout the game\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - They've now lost to my scissors play with their rock move\n   - They might continue with rock despite the loss (consistent with their earlier behavior)\n   - Or they might change their move after a loss (as they did with scissors)\n   - Their strongest historical preference is for rock\n\n5. Probability calculation:\n   - Given their historical preference for rock\n   - And their tendency to stick with moves despite losses\n   - There's still a reasonable probability they'll continue with rock\n\n6. Optimal decision:\n   - Given their recent behavior and historical preferences\n   - Scissors remains the optimal play if they continue with rock\n\n[move] scissors (Continuing to counter their likely rock play while remaining alert to potential pattern changes)\n"
