In round 23, I played paper and they played rock. According to the rules (\"rock beats paper\"), I should lose, which matches the result.\n\nThe rules state:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nMy opponent's moves:\nrock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\nTheir last move was rock. Following their established rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern, they'll likely play paper next.\n\nAccording to the rules, scissors beats paper. I'll try scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
