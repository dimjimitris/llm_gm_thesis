Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In rock-paper-scissors, players often shift their strategy after a tie.

The complete sequence of moves (with rules: scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors):\n   - Me: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - Opponent: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n2. Updated frequency of my opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 6 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n3. Rock and scissors are now tied as their most frequent choices.\n4. The cycle I thought I identified (Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper) has been broken. Instead of playing scissors after paper, they played rock.\n5. This suggests either:\n   - They recognized I had figured out their pattern and deliberately broke it\n   - They're following a more complex pattern I haven't yet identified\n   - They're making more randomized choices\n6. Looking at their most recent moves:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock\n7. After playing paper and winning against my scissors, they played rock and won against my paper.\n8. This could indicate they're now trying to stay with winning moves rather than cycling.\n9. After winning with rock against my paper, they might:\n   - Stay with rock again (continuing with a winning move)\n   - Switch to paper (if they think I'll play scissors to counter their expected rock)\n   - Switch to scissors (if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected paper)\n10. Given that they've just had two consecutive wins by playing what beats my previous move, they might try to continue this strategy.\n11. If they expect me to play scissors (to counter their expected rock), they might play paper.\n12. However, given their equal preference for rock and scissors, and their recent success with rock, they might stick with rock.\n13. To counter both possibilities effectively, I'll choose scissors, which would beat rock and tie with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

            "text": "I lost again - my opponent played paper when I expected rock or scissors. They're becoming harder to predict. Let me carefully reconsider my approach.\n\nSteps:\n1. The complete sequence of moves (with rules: scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors):\n   - Me: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - Opponent: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n2. Updated frequency of my opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 7 times\n3. Their distribution is now perfectly balanced across all three moves.\n4. Their most recent sequence:\n   - Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper\n5. After winning with rock against my paper, they played paper and won against my scissors.\n6. This suggests they might be successfully predicting my moves and countering them.\n7. Looking at their overall pattern throughout the game, they seem to have shifted strategies multiple times:\n   - Early game: more random or matching\n   - Mid game: following patterns like playing what loses to my previous move\n   - Recent game: successfully countering my moves\n8. After winning with paper against my scissors, they might:\n   - Stay with paper (continuing with a winning move)\n   - Switch to rock (if they think I'll play paper to counter their expected paper)\n   - Switch to scissors (if they think I'll play rock to counter their expected rock)\n9. Given their recent success with varying their moves unpredictably, and their now balanced distribution, predicting their next move is challenging.\n10. If I look at their longer-term pattern, they haven't played the same move three times in a row recently, so they're unlikely to play paper a third consecutive time.\n11. Between rock and scissors, they might favor rock given their recent success with it.\n12. To counter their anticipated rock play, I'll choose scissors (which beats rock in these reversed rules).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The complete sequence of moves (with rules: scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors):\n   - Me: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors\n   - Opponent: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n2. Updated frequency of my opponent's moves:\n   - Rock: 7 times\n   - Paper: 7 times\n   - Scissors: 8 times\n3. Scissors has again become their most frequent choice, though only slightly.\n4. Their most recent sequence:\n   - Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n5. They broke their pattern of consecutive paper plays by switching to scissors.\n6. After our scissors-scissors tie, they might:\n   - Switch to rock (expecting me to switch to paper)\n   - Switch to paper (expecting me to stay with scissors)\n   - Stay with scissors (less likely given their tendency to switch after ties)\n7. In previous rounds after a tie, they've typically switched their move.\n8. Given they've used scissors most frequently overall, they might be less inclined to play scissors again immediately.\n9. Between rock and paper, both seem equally likely based on their overall distribution.\n10. Looking at their longer-term patterns, they've recently alternated between paper and another move (rock or scissors).\n11. Following this loose pattern, they might play rock after scissors.\n12. Given their adaptability and unpredictability shown in recent rounds, I need to be cautious in my prediction.\n13. To counter their anticipated rock play, I'll choose scissors again (which beats rock in these reversed rules).\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
