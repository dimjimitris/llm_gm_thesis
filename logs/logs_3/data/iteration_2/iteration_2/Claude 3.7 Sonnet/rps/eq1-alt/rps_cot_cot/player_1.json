Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Given this psychological tendency, choosing paper could give me a slight edge.\n6. But I should also consider mixing up my strategy to remain unpredictable in future rounds.\n7.

After our long streak of ties was broken (when I won with paper against their scissors), we're now back to tying with rock.\n2.

Five out of six rounds have been ties, which is statistically very unlikely by chance.\n5. The other player seems to be anticipating my moves with high accuracy.\n6. They may be using a common rock-paper-scissors algorithm or psychology.\n7. Since we just played rock, conventional wisdom would suggest either paper or scissors next.\n8. If they're trying to beat my next move, they might expect me to play paper (to beat our mutual rock), so they'd play scissors.\n9. To counter this, I should play rock again, which would beat their scissors.\n10. However, repeating moves is unusual in RPS, so they might not expect me to play rock twice in a row.\n11. Given the unusual pattern of this game, I'll take the less conventional approach and stick with rock for another round.\n\nFinal decision: I'll choose rock again, betting that the opponent will switch to scissors expecting me to switch to paper.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
