Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

They've now played scissors three times in a row, which is a significant change in their pattern.\n\n4. Overall frequencies: rock (4 times), scissors (5 times), paper (2 times). They clearly favor scissors and rock.\n\n5. Their success with scissors may encourage them to continue with it, especially since it just won against my paper.\n\n6. Alternatively, they might expect me to play rock to counter their scissors streak, and thus switch to paper.\n\n7. However, given their historical reluctance to play paper (only 2 out of 11 rounds) and their success with scissors, they seem more likely to either:\n   - Continue with scissors a fourth time\n   - Switch to rock anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n\n8. Between these two possibilities, rock seems the more cautious choice for them after such a long scissors streak. If they play rock, my paper would win. If they stick with scissors, my rock would win. Since rock counters scissors and scissors has been their most frequent recent play, rock is my best strategic move.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"

They've now played paper four times in a row, which is extraordinary and completely breaks their previous patterns.\n\n4. Overall frequencies: rock (5 times), scissors (6 times), paper (7 times). Paper has now become their most played move.\n\n5. It appears they've identified and are exploiting a pattern in my play - specifically my tendency to play rock when I think they'll play scissors.\n\n6. They've won the last two rounds using the same strategy, which suggests they:\n   - Have figured out my decision-making pattern\n   - Are comfortable repeatedly exploiting the same vulnerability\n\n7. After four consecutive papers and two consecutive wins with the same strategy, they might:\n   - Continue with paper a fifth time (extremely unusual but has been working)\n   - Switch to scissors anticipating I'll finally adjust and play paper\n   - Switch to rock as a \"reset\" move after a long streak\n\n8. Given that they've successfully used the same move four times in a row to win twice, the most psychologically sound move for me is to break my pattern completely and play scissors, which would beat their paper if they continue the streak, and tie with their scissors if they switch.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] scissors\n"

They played paper for the fifth consecutive time, and I finally countered correctly with scissors.\n\n4. Overall frequencies: rock (5 times), scissors (6 times), paper (8 times). Paper is now their clearly dominant move.\n\n5. After losing with paper to my scissors, they're likely to:\n   - Break their paper streak and switch to rock (which would beat my scissors if I play them again)\n   - Switch to scissors expecting me to play paper to counter their anticipated rock\n\n6. Looking at their behavior after losses:\n   - After losing in round 3, they played rock\n   - After losing in round 4, they played rock\n   - After losing in round 9, they played scissors\n   - After losing in round 14, they played paper\n   - After losing in round 19 (just now), historical patterns suggest rock is likely\n\n7. The extremely unusual five-paper streak suggests they were exploiting a pattern they observed in my play. Now that this strategy has failed, they'll almost certainly switch.\n\n8. Given their historical tendency to play rock after losses, the fact that rock is a logical counter to my scissors, and the psychological dynamics of breaking a long streak, rock is their most probable next move.

They played paper, resulting in a tie. This breaks my winning streak at three.\n\n4. Overall frequencies: rock (6 times), scissors (7 times), paper (9 times).

Looking at their behavior after ties (now 8 instances):\n   - After tie in round 2: scissors (round 3)\n   - After tie in round 7: rock (round 8)\n   - After tie in round 8: scissors (round 9)\n   - After tie in round 10: scissors (round 11)\n   - After tie in round 12: paper (round 13)\n   - After tie in round 16: paper (round 17)\n   - After tie in round 22: ?\n\n6. There's a slight pattern where they've played scissors 3 times after ties, paper 2 times, and rock 1 time.\n\n7. The tie has disrupted both of our momentum - I was on a winning streak, and they were losing repeatedly. This \"reset\" might cause them to:\n   - Return to scissors, which has been their most common move after ties\n   - Try rock, which would counter the scissors I might play expecting their scissors\n   - Continue with paper, which worked well for them earlier\n\n8.

We've now had two ties in a row, with paper and then rock.\n\n4. Overall frequencies: rock (7 times), scissors (7 times), paper (9 times).\n\n5. Looking at their behavior after consecutive ties:\n   - After ties in rounds 7-8: scissors (round 9)\n   - After ties in rounds 22-23: ?\n\n6. Our current situation is similar to rounds 7-8 where we had paper and then rock ties. They played scissors after that sequence.\n\n7. They might observe that I'm trying to predict their moves based on historical patterns, and thus try to be less predictable.\n\n8. Given our recent sequence (paper tie, rock tie) and the similar historical situation where they played scissors after consecutive ties, scissors is a likely move for them. However, they might also anticipate that I'll expect scissors based on this pattern and play paper instead to counter my expected rock.\n\n9. Weighing these factors, I believe scissors is still their most probable move based on historical patterns, but paper is a strong alternative if they're trying to be more sophisticated in their strategy. Between these two possibilities, rock gives me a win against scissors and only a loss against paper, making it the better strategic choice.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision:\n\n[move] rock\n"
