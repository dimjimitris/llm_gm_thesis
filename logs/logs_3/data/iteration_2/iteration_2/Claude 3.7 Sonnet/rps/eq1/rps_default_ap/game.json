After sticking with scissors for so long, they switched to paper exactly when I became most confident in their scissors strategy. This suggests:\n\n1. They might be carefully tracking my moves and responses\n2. They could be employing a psychological strategy - conditioning me to expect scissors\n3. They might start a new pattern now, possibly beginning with paper\n\nSince they just broke their long scissors streak with paper, they might:\n- Continue with paper to see if I'll adjust\n- Go back to scissors thinking I'll expect paper again\n- Switch to rock anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their paper\n\nGiven this significant change, I'll counter their paper with:\n\n[move] scissors\n"
