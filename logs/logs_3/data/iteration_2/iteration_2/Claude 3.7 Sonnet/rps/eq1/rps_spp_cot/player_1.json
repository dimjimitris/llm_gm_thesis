Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, if I become too predictable with this pattern, they'll likely counter with paper.\n11. Given they just repeated scissors (unsuccessfully), they might switch to paper or rock.\n12. If they switch to paper, scissors would be my best move.\n13. If they switch to rock, paper would be my best move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper. This would beat rock if they switch to it, and I assess this as more likely than them playing paper (which would beat my paper) because: (a) they've just lost with scissors twice, (b) they seem to adapt to defeat patterns, and (c) they haven't played rock in a while.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This would beat rock if they repeat it, tie with paper if they switch to that, and lose to scissors. Given their recent success with countering my moves, they might expect me to play rock (the logical counter to their rock). If they anticipate this and play paper, my paper would tie. If they try to counter my anticipated scissors (thinking I'm going one level deeper), they would play rock again, and my paper would win.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My current record is: 7 wins, 8 losses, 6 ties - my opponent has taken the lead.\n4. My opponent has won three consecutive rounds, correctly anticipating and countering each of my moves.\n5. Their recent sequence shows: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, which doesn't follow a simple pattern.\n6. After playing rock previously, they've now played scissors, which they've done once before.\n7. Their overall distribution is: rock (6 times), paper (7 times), scissors (8 times).\n8. They seem to be reading my strategy effectively, possibly anticipating that I'm trying to counter their previous move.\n9. Given they've just played scissors and won, they might:\n   - Play rock next, anticipating I'll play rock to counter their scissors\n   - Play scissors again if they think I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock\n   - Play paper if they think I'll overthink and play scissors\n10. At this point, the game has become highly psychological with multiple levels of anticipation.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock. This would beat scissors if they repeat it, tie with rock if they switch to that, and lose to paper. Since they've won three times in a row by correctly anticipating my moves, they may have developed a sense of my thinking pattern. By playing rock, I'm making the most direct counter to their last move (scissors), which might be unexpected given the complexity our game has developed. Additionally, rock has been my most successful move throughout the game.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Their recent sequence shows: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, which doesn't follow an obvious pattern.\n6. Their overall distribution is: rock (6 times), paper (8 times), scissors (8 times).\n7. At this point, it seems my opponent has developed strong insight into my thought process.\n8. Rather than trying to detect a pattern in their moves, I need to make my own moves less predictable.\n9. After my four consecutive losses, it's clear that trying to counter their previous move or anticipate their next one based on patterns isn't working.\n10. A completely random move might be the best strategy to break this losing streak.\n11. However, looking at their overall game, they've played paper most recently and have played it slightly more frequently than rock.\n12. If I make a truly unpredictable move without overthinking, scissors would counter their most recent move.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors. This breaks my pattern of trying to counter their anticipated move and simply responds to their most recent action. If they play paper again, I'll win. If they play rock (anticipating my scissors), I'll lose. If they play scissors, we'll tie. Given that overthinking and multi-level anticipation has led to four losses, a more direct approach might disrupt their ability to predict my moves.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

My current record is: 7 wins, 10 losses, 6 ties - my opponent now leads by 3 points.\n4. My opponent has won five consecutive rounds, suggesting they have completely figured out my thinking patterns.\n5. Their recent sequence shows: scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock, which appears to follow the standard cycling pattern.\n6. Their overall distribution is: rock (7 times), paper (8 times), scissors (8 times).\n7. At this point, conventional strategic thinking has failed me consistently.\n8. If my opponent is following a rock-paper-scissors cycle in their recent moves, they would play scissors next.\n9. However, given their success, they may expect me to notice this pattern and play rock to counter their expected scissors.\n10. In that case, they would play paper to beat my rock.\n11. This multi-level anticipation hasn't worked well for me in recent rounds.\n12. Let me take a completely different approach. Instead of trying to outsmart them, I'll use a move they might not expect based on frequencies alone.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper. My opponent has played rock 7 times, and I've only beaten them with paper 3 times in our entire game. If they play rock again (either continuing their cycling pattern or anticipating I'll play scissors), I'll win. If they play scissors, I'll lose. If they play paper, we'll tie. Given my consistent losses with scissors, switching to paper represents a significant pattern break that might disrupt their ability to predict my moves.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
