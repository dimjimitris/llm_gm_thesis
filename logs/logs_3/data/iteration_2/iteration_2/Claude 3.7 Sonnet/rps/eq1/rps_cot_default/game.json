Looking at their last several moves:\n   - Rock (round 10)\n   - Scissors (round 11)\n   - Paper (round 12)\n   - Rock (round 13)\n\n3. Their pattern since round 10 appears to be following what I initially identified: they're playing the move that would lose to my previous move.\n   - I played paper in round 10, they played rock in round 11 (rock loses to paper)\n   - I played rock in round 11, they played scissors in round 12 (scissors loses to rock)\n   - I played scissors in round 12, they played paper in round 13 (paper loses to scissors)\n   - I played paper in round 13... following the pattern, they should play rock (which they did)\n\n4. This pattern seems consistent across multiple rounds now. If it holds:\n   - I just played paper in round 13\n   - The move that loses to paper is rock\n   - So they would play scissors in round 14 (as scissors loses to rock)\n\n5.

If they're truly playing the move that loses to my previous move, then I should play rock to counter their anticipated scissors.\n\n7. There's a small chance they might finally break this pattern after losing so many rounds, but without evidence of adaptation, exploiting the observed pattern remains optimal.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, anticipating they'll play scissors (the move that loses to my previous paper).\n\n[move] rock\n"

Given this is the first deviation after many consistent rounds, I shouldn't completely abandon my understanding of their behavior yet, but I should be cautious.\n\n5. If they're now actively trying to counter my moves, they might anticipate I'll expect them to return to their pattern, in which case they'd expect me to play paper (to beat their anticipated rock).\n\n6.
