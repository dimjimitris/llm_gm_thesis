Looking at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Ties give 0 points\n\nThe key insight is that paper has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Rock and scissors have lower but equal rewards/penalties (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely doesn't have a developed strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with common intuitive choices. Many new players tend to start with rock as it's often the first option people think of.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value, I'll take the calculated risk and play paper. If my opponent chooses rock (which is common for new players), I'll gain 3 points. If they choose scissors, I'll lose 1 point. If they choose paper, it's a tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

If they expect rock from me, they'd play paper to get the 3-point win.\n\nEither way, if they play paper next, scissors is my best move.\n\nHowever, there's also a chance they'll break any pattern and play rock again or scissors.
