    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Evaluate the situation:\n   - If they play scissors AGAIN (6th time): I play rock (+1 point)\n   - At this point, the pattern is so strong I should assume scissors\n   - Rock is the guaranteed counter\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent has shown incredible commitment to scissors\n   - Even after alternating wins and losses, they keep returning to it\n   - I must capitalize on this predictability with rock\n   - This is almost a guaranteed win at this point\n\n[move] (Opponent has played scissors five consecutive times despite mixed results, showing extreme commitment to this move, so I'll counter with rock again) rock\n"

Analyze the confirmed scissors return:\n   - Round 5-10: Opponent played scissors six consecutive times (original streak)\n   - Round 11-16: Opponent played paper six consecutive times\n   - Round 17: Opponent played rock (single occurrence)\n   - Round 18-20: Opponent has now played scissors three consecutive times (new streak)\n   - Current score: I have 11 points total (10 + 1 = 11)\n\n2. Recognize the pattern return:\n   - The opponent has clearly returned to their scissors streak behavior\n   - Three scissors in a row strongly suggests this will continue\n   - Their original scissors streak lasted 6 rounds\n   - This new scissors streak might follow the same length\n\n3. Consider their established behavior:\n   - They tend to play moves in long streaks regardless of results\n   - Scissors is their most frequently used move overall\n   - They persist through losses when committed to a streak\n   - The pattern is becoming very predictable again\n\n4. Evaluate my strategy:\n   - If opponent continues scissors (4th consecutive time): I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - Rock has beaten their scissors three times in a row now\n   - This is working perfectly and should continue\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent is clearly back in scissors streak mode\n   - Three consecutive scissors strongly indicates a fourth is coming\n   - Rock beats scissors for reliable +1 points\n   - I should continue exploiting this predictable pattern\n   - Easy points as long as they maintain their scissors streak\n\n[move] (Opponent has returned to scissors streak behavior with three consecutive plays, almost certainly continuing with a fourth scissors, so I'll counter with rock for another win) rock\n"

They broke their scissors streak after just 3 plays, much shorter than their previous streaks.\n\nSteps for Round 22:\n\n1. Analyze the pattern break:\n   - Round 18-20: Opponent played scissors three consecutive times\n   - Round 21: Opponent switched to paper (beat my rock)\n   - Their scissors streaks are getting shorter and less predictable\n   - Current score: I have 8 points total (11 - 3 = 8)\n\n2. Reconsider their evolving strategy:\n   - Original scissors streak: 6 rounds\n   - Paper streak: 6 rounds  \n   - Recent scissors streak: only 3 rounds\n   - They're becoming less predictable and more strategic\n   - They might be adapting to my counter-strategies\n\n3. Evaluate their likely thinking:\n   - They probably noticed I was consistently playing rock against their scissors\n   - Paper beats rock perfectly - this was a calculated counter\n   - They might expect me to adjust away from rock now\n   - They could continue with paper or switch again\n\n4. Consider my options:\n   - If opponent continues with paper: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent returns to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent tries rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - They just successfully used paper to beat my rock pattern\n   - They might stick with paper since it just worked\n   - Or they might think I'll expect paper and switch\n   - Scissors beats paper and could get me back on track\n   - I need to recover from this -3 point loss\n\n[move] (Opponent just successfully countered my rock pattern with paper, might continue with paper since it worked, so I'll counter with scissors to recover) scissors\n"

I'm recovering from that -3 loss.\n\nSteps for Round 23:\n\n1. Analyze the recent moves:\n   - Round 18-20: Opponent played scissors three times\n   - Round 21: Opponent played paper (beat my rock for -3)\n   - Round 22: Opponent played paper again (lost to my scissors)\n   - Current score: I have 9 points total (8 + 1 = 9)\n\n2. Notice the new paper pattern:\n   - The opponent has now played paper twice in a row\n   - After breaking their scissors streak, they might be starting a paper streak\n   - Their previous paper streak was 6 rounds long\n   - They tend to commit to moves for multiple rounds\n\n3. Consider their psychology:\n   - Paper just won big against my rock (+3), then lost to my scissors (-1)\n   - Net positive result with paper might encourage them to continue\n   - They historically play moves in streaks\n   - Two papers suggest a possible longer paper streak beginning\n\n4. Evaluate strategic options:\n   - If opponent continues paper (3rd time): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n   - If opponent returns to scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - The opponent shows tendency toward streaks\n   - Two papers in a row suggests they might continue the pattern\n   - Their previous paper streak lasted 6 rounds\n   - Scissors beats paper for consistent +1 points\n   - I should continue countering their likely paper with scissors\n\n[move] (Opponent has played paper twice in a row and historically favors streaks, likely continuing with paper for a third time, so I'll counter with scissors) scissors\n"
