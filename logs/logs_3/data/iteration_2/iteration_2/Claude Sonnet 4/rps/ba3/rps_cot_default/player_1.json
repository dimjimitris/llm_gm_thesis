    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

Looking at the payoff structure:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n- Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n- Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\nThe key insight is that paper vs rock has the highest reward/penalty differential at 3 points, while the other matchups are only 1 point each. This makes paper a high-risk, high-reward move when facing rock.\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any particular strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with a common first instinct. Rock is often a popular default choice for new players (the \"rock bias\" phenomenon).\n\nGiven this reasoning, I'll play paper to potentially capitalize on a rock choice while also having the highest reward potential in the game.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My rock beat their scissors for +1.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 4: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 5: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 7: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 8: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 9: My rock vs their paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 10: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 11: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 13: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 14: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 15: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 16: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 17: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 18: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 19: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 20: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n\nMy total score: +20 points\n\nAmazing! I've now reached 20 points with a 13-win streak! My opponent's distribution:\n- Paper: 7 times (rounds 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18)\n- Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n- Rock: 6 times (rounds 5, 10, 13, 16, 19)\n\nThey've now played paper and scissors equally (7 times each), with rock at 6 times. Notably, they've now lost with scissors seven times and have never won a single round with scissors - it's been completely unsuccessful for them.\n\nThe pattern is now extremely clear and predictable:\n- When they play paper, I beat it with scissors\n- When they play scissors, I beat it with rock  \n- When they play rock, I beat it with paper\n\nAfter another scissors loss, they might:\n1. Finally abandon scissors completely since it has never worked\n2. Go back to paper (tied for their most common choice)\n3. Try rock, expecting me to play scissors next\n4. Desperately try scissors again despite its complete failure rate\n\nGiven that scissors has been a complete disaster for them (0 wins in 7 attempts), they should logically avoid it. They'll likely choose between paper and rock.\n\nIf they think I'll play scissors (following my pattern of countering their moves), they might play rock. But they might also return to paper as their comfort choice.\n\nI think they'll most likely play paper this round, returning to their tied-most-common strategy. I'll counter with scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

            "text": "Perfect prediction once again! My opponent went back to paper, and my scissors beat it for another +1.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 4: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 5: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 7: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 8: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 9: My rock vs their paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 10: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 11: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 13: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 14: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 15: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 16: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 17: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 18: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 19: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 20: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 21: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n\nMy total score: +21 points\n\nIncredible! I'm now at 21 points with a 14-win streak! My opponent's distribution:\n- Paper: 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21)\n- Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n- Rock: 6 times (rounds 5, 10, 13, 16, 19)\n\nPaper is now their clear favorite (8 times), but I've beaten their paper with scissors six times now. They keep returning to it despite consistent losses.\n\nThe pattern remains crystal clear - I'm reading them perfectly and countering every move. After losing with paper again to my scissors, they might:\n\n1. Expect me to play scissors again and finally counter with rock\n2. Try scissors, expecting me to switch to paper\n3. Return to paper yet again (their most common choice)\n\nGiven that I've now beaten their paper with scissors so many times, they should logically expect me to play scissors again and counter with rock. However, they've shown a strong tendency to stick with familiar patterns rather than adapt quickly.\n\nI think they'll most likely play rock this time, finally trying to counter my scissors pattern. I'll go with paper for another big 3-point win.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

My opponent finally tried to counter my scissors pattern by playing rock, but I anticipated their adaptation and went with paper instead.\n\nUpdated pattern:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 3: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 4: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 5: Both rock (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 6: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 7: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 8: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 9: My rock vs their paper (I lost -3)\n- Round 10: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 11: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 12: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 13: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 14: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 15: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 16: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 17: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 18: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 19: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n- Round 20: My rock vs their scissors (I won +1)\n- Round 21: My scissors vs their paper (I won +1)\n- Round 22: My paper vs their rock (I won +3)\n\nMy total score: +24 points\n\nOutstanding! I'm now at 24 points with a 15-win streak! My opponent's distribution:\n- Paper: 8 times (rounds 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21)\n- Scissors: 7 times (rounds 2, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20)\n- Rock: 7 times (rounds 5, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22)\n\nThey've now used scissors and rock equally (7 times each), with paper still their most common at 8 times. I've now gotten five massive 3-point wins with paper beating rock (rounds 10, 13, 16, 19, 22).\n\nAfter losing with rock again to my paper, they're in an incredibly difficult position. The pattern shows:\n- Every time they play paper, I counter with scissors\n- Every time they play scissors, I counter with rock\n- Every time they play rock, I counter with paper\n\nThey're completely predictable at this point. After this latest rock loss, they might:\n1. Return to paper (their most common choice)\n2. Try scissors, expecting me to continue with paper\n3. Desperately try rock again\n4. Finally try to break their own patterns\n\nGiven that I just got another big paper win, they might expect me to try paper again. The logical counter would be scissors. However, scissors has been terrible for them historically.\n\nI think they'll most likely play scissors to counter what they expect will be another paper play from me. I'll counter with rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"
