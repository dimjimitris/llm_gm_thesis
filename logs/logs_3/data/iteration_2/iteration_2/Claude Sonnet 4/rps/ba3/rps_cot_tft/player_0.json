    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

            "text": "I need to analyze this rock-paper-scissors variant and make a strategic first move.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 points (winner), -3 points (loser)\n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 points (winner), -1 points (loser)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock gives the highest reward (+3/-3)\n   - Rock beating scissors and scissors beating paper both give lower rewards (+1/-1)\n\n3. Consider strategy against a \"fresh player\":\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's intuitive (solid, strong)\n   - Many beginners choose rock on their first move\n   - If opponent plays rock, I want to play paper to get the maximum +3 points\n\n4. Evaluate risk vs reward:\n   - Playing paper: Best case +3 (if opponent plays rock), worst case -1 (if opponent plays scissors)\n   - Playing rock: Best case +1 (if opponent plays scissors), worst case -3 (if opponent plays paper)\n   - Playing scissors: Best case +1 (if opponent plays paper), worst case -1 (if opponent plays rock)\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - Paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Against a likely rock choice from a fresh player, paper maximizes my expected value\n   - The risk is manageable (-1 if they play scissors)\n\n[move] paper\n"
