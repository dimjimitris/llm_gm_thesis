Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - Rock and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" (new player)\n   - New players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n\n4. Determine optimal strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (likely for a new player), paper wins with +3 points\n   - If opponent plays paper, scissors wins with +1 point\n   - If opponent plays scissors, rock wins with +1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing paper has the highest potential reward (+3)\n   - Even if wrong, the penalty is manageable (-1 or -3)\n   - The probability of a new player choosing rock seems highest\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player and maximize potential points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Update my understanding of the opponent:\n   - They chose paper in round 1, showing they might also be targeting the high-value move\n   - They could be thinking similarly about maximizing points\n   - Or they might have anticipated that I would expect them to play rock\n\n3. Consider opponent's likely next move:\n   - They might stick with paper since it has the highest reward potential\n   - They might switch to rock, thinking I'll avoid paper after the tie\n   - They might try scissors to counter if they expect me to play paper again\n   - Some players alternate or change strategy after ties\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1 point)\n   - If they switch to rock: paper wins (+3 points)  \n   - If they play scissors: rock wins (+1 point)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Playing scissors counters paper (their round 1 choice) with +1 points\n   - It's a reasonable counter-strategy that doesn't chase the highest reward but plays more defensively\n   - If they're thinking \"they might expect paper again,\" scissors is a good counter\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter a potential repeat of paper, or win against paper if they stick with their previous choice.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Look for new patterns or insights:\n   - Opponent has now played each move 3 times: Paper (3x), Rock (3x), Scissors (3x)\n   - They seem to be maintaining balance across all moves\n   - The tie in round 9 suggests they might be adapting to my predictions\n\n4. Consider opponent's possible strategy:\n   - They might be deliberately staying unpredictable\n   - They could be reacting to my pattern-seeking behavior\n   - The balanced usage suggests intentional mixed strategy\n\n5. Evaluate my current situation:\n   - I'm at -4 points and struggling to predict their moves\n   - My pattern recognition attempts have mostly failed\n   - I need a different approach - perhaps less predictable myself\n\n6. Strategic options:\n   - Continue trying to read patterns (hasn't worked well)\n   - Play more randomly/unpredictably\n   - Focus on moves that minimize maximum loss\n   - Try the move I haven't used recently\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - I've played scissors in the last 2 rounds\n   - Maybe varying my own play will help\n   - Paper offers the highest reward potential (+3)\n   - Rock is safer but lower reward\n   - Since I'm significantly behind, I might need to take some calculated risks\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially get the high reward and because I haven't used it recently, making me less predictable.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze opponent's complete sequence:\n   - Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - They've now played: Paper (3x), Rock (4x), Scissors (3x)\n   - Rock is slightly favored in their recent play\n\n3. Identify key patterns in Paper vs Rock exchanges:\n   - Round 6: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, they played rock (I won +3)\n   - When I've played paper recently, they've responded with rock\n   - This could be coincidence or a tendency\n\n4. Consider opponent's possible thinking:\n   - They might expect me to play paper again after two big wins with it\n   - If they expect paper, they might counter with scissors\n   - Or they might stick with rock if they haven't adjusted yet\n   - They could be trying to break any patterns I might exploit\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play scissors (countering expected paper): rock beats scissors (+1)\n   - If they play rock again: paper beats rock (+3)\n   - If they play paper: scissors beats paper (+1)\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   - I'm at -1, very close to breaking even\n   - Playing paper chases another +3 but risks -1 if they counter with scissors\n   - Playing rock is safer and would beat scissors if they counter my expected paper\n   - Rock limits downside while still offering upside\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   - The opponent might anticipate me repeating the successful paper play\n   - Rock would counter their potential scissors counter-play\n   - It's a more defensive choice that still offers winning potential\n   - Given I'm close to even, protecting against big losses makes sense\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter potential scissors while avoiding the risk of repeating the paper strategy they might expect.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Identify the devastating pattern:\n   - Rounds where I played rock: 3, 5, 7, 8, 11\n   - Opponent's responses: Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper\n   - In rounds 5, 7, 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (-3 each time)\n   - This has happened 3 times now!\n\n3. Analyze opponent's strategy:\n   - They seem to have identified that I play rock frequently\n   - When I play rock, they often counter with paper for the maximum penalty\n   - They're exploiting my rock tendency very effectively\n\n4. Consider why I keep falling into this trap:\n   - I've been trying to be \"safe\" with rock\n   - But rock has become my most punished move\n   - The opponent may have learned to read my defensive tendencies\n\n5. Evaluate what the opponent might expect now:\n   - They've successfully countered my rock 3 times with paper\n   - They might expect me to avoid rock now\n   - They could anticipate paper (for recovery) or scissors\n   - Or they might stick with paper expecting another rock\n\n6. Strategic recalibration:\n   - I need to break the rock-paper cycle that's hurting me\n   - Scissors would beat paper if they continue their anti-rock strategy\n   - Even if they switch to rock, scissors only loses -1 vs the -3 I keep taking\n   - I need to stop being predictable with rock\n\n7. Decision rationale:\n   - Scissors counters their paper strategy that's been crushing me\n   - It breaks my rock pattern they've been exploiting\n   - Lower risk than chasing +3 with paper\n   - Forces them to adjust their successful counter-strategy\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter their paper exploitation and break the destructive rock-paper pattern.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze my failed strategies:\n   - Pattern recognition: I keep trying to predict their moves and failing\n   - Defensive play: My \"safe\" rock plays got exploited repeatedly  \n   - Counter-strategies: When I try to counter their patterns, they switch\n   - I'm being systematically outmaneuvered\n\n3. Examine opponent's skill level:\n   - Initially described as \"fresh player\" but they're playing very strategically\n   - They've maintained balanced move distribution while exploiting my tendencies\n   - They seem to be reading my predictive attempts and countering them\n   - This opponent is clearly experienced and adaptive\n\n4. Identify my core problem:\n   - I'm overthinking and becoming predictable in my attempts to be unpredictable\n   - The opponent appears to be reading my thought processes\n   - My pattern-seeking behavior has become a pattern itself that's being exploited\n\n5. Consider a new approach:\n   - Stop trying to predict their moves entirely\n   - Focus on my own move selection independent of their patterns\n   - Make a genuinely random or intuitive choice\n   - Avoid overthinking which has clearly failed\n\n6. Evaluate options without pattern analysis:\n   - Paper: Highest reward potential (+3)\n   - Rock: Medium risk, been exploited recently\n   - Scissors: Lower reward (+1) but also lower risk\n\n7. Simple decision making:\n   - I need points badly (-5 score)\n   - Paper offers the best potential recovery\n   - Sometimes the straightforward high-reward play is the right choice\n   - Stop second-guessing and just make a direct play\n\nFinal decision: Play paper for the potential +3 recovery, abandoning complex prediction attempts.\n\n[move] paper\n"
