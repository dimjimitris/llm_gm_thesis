    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for winner, -3 for loser  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for winner, -1 for loser\n\n2. Notice the asymmetric payoffs - paper beating rock gives much higher rewards (3 points) compared to the other winning combinations (1 point each).\n\n3. Consider what a \"fresh player\" might do:\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the most intuitive/aggressive choice\n   - They may not immediately notice the asymmetric payoff structure\n\n4. Evaluate my best strategy given this analysis:\n   - If they play rock (likely), I should play paper to get +3 points\n   - This maximizes my potential gain\n   - Even if they don't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1), which is better than the -3 penalty I'd face if I played rock and they played paper\n\n5. Paper seems like the optimal choice given:\n   - High reward potential (+3 vs rock)\n   - Limited downside (-1 vs scissors)\n   - Takes advantage of likely opponent behavior\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review the previous round:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - I lost 1 point (-1)\n   - My assumption about the opponent being likely to play rock was wrong\n\n2. Analyze what this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They didn't choose the \"default\" rock option\n   - They may understand the payoff structure better than I initially thought\n   - They chose scissors, which beats paper but only gives +1 points\n\n3. Consider the meta-game reasoning:\n   - They might expect me to play paper again (since it has the highest reward potential)\n   - Or they might think I'll switch strategies after losing\n\n4. Evaluate my options for this round:\n   - Rock: Beats scissors (+1), loses to paper (-3)\n   - Paper: Beats rock (+3), loses to scissors (-1) \n   - Scissors: Beats paper (+1), loses to rock (-1)\n\n5. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If they think I'll play paper again, they might play scissors again\n   - If they think I'll switch to rock (to counter their scissors), they might play paper\n   - Rock seems like a good choice because it beats scissors (their last move) and only has moderate risk (-1) against paper, unlike the -3 risk I face with other combinations\n\n6.

Analyze opponent's pattern:\n   - Round 1: scissors\n   - Round 2: rock\n   - They seem to be varying their moves, not sticking to one strategy\n\n3.
