Rock and scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" with no history, I have no information about their tendencies. In standard rock-paper-scissors, players often default to rock as their first move due to psychological biases.\n\nGiven that paper beats rock and offers the highest point value, and assuming the opponent might choose rock as a common first move, I'll go with paper to maximize my potential gain.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
