    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Rock beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Paper beats rock: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n   - Scissors beats paper: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Paper gives the highest reward (+3 points) when it wins against rock\n   - This makes paper the most valuable winning move\n\n3. Consider opponent strategy:\n   - The opponent is described as \"fresh\" - likely inexperienced\n   - Fresh players often default to rock as it's the first option mentioned\n   - Rock is also psychologically associated with strength/aggression\n\n4. Optimize my strategy:\n   - If opponent plays rock (most likely), I should play paper to get +3 points\n   - Even if opponent doesn't play rock, paper only loses to scissors (giving me -1)\n   - The risk-reward ratio favors paper: potential +3 vs potential -1\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Paper maximizes expected value against a fresh player\n   - High reward potential with manageable risk\n\n[move] paper\n"

Reconsider opponent behavior:\n   - The opponent is not as predictable as initially thought\n   - They also chose the highest-value move (paper)\n   - This indicates they understand the payoff structure\n\n3. Anticipate opponent's next move:\n   - Since we both played paper last round, the opponent might:\n     a) Stick with paper (thinking I'll switch)\n     b) Switch to scissors (to counter paper)\n     c) Switch to rock (for variety)\n\n4. Evaluate my options:\n   - If opponent plays paper again: I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: I should play rock (+1 point)\n   - If opponent plays rock: I should play paper (+3 points)\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - Given that paper was just played by both, scissors seems like a logical counter-move\n   - Scissors beats paper and gives me +1 point\n   - Even if wrong, I only lose 1 point (vs rock) or tie (vs scissors)\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played scissors, opponent played paper\n   - I won and scored +1 point\n   - My prediction was correct - opponent tried to counter an expected rock with paper\n\n2. Assess opponent's likely mindset after losing:\n   - They just lost by playing paper against my scissors\n   - They might think I'll stick with scissors since it just won\n   - Or they might expect me to switch since I got the win I wanted\n\n3. Consider opponent's potential responses:\n   - If they think I'll play scissors again: they'll play rock to counter (+1 for them)\n   - If they think I'll switch: they might try to anticipate my new choice\n   - They might also go back to a previous move that tied (paper or rock)\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Playing scissors again is risky - opponent likely expects it\n   - Playing rock counters their likely rock response (+1 for me)\n   - Playing paper gets maximum points (+3) if they play rock, but loses to scissors\n\n5.
