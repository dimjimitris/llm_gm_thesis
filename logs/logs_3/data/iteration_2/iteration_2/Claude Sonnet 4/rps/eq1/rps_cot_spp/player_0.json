    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The alternating pattern is now crystal clear! Looking at their last 6 moves: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock. They are strictly alternating between paper and rock.\n\n4. Following this established alternating pattern, after playing rock in round 11, they should play paper in round 12.\n\n5. This alternating pattern has held perfectly for 6 consecutive rounds, making it highly predictable.\n\n6. If they play paper next (following the pattern), I should play scissors to beat paper and win.\n\n7. The pattern is so consistent that I'm confident they'll continue alternating.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors to beat the expected paper move in their strict alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

The alternating pattern has broken! They were alternating paper and rock for 6 rounds, but instead of playing paper in round 12, they played scissors.\n\n4. This is significant - they've only played scissors twice in 12 rounds (rounds 3 and 12), making it their least used move.\n\n5. Possible reasons for the break:\n   - They realized I was exploiting their pattern\n   - They're switching to a new strategy\n   - Random deviation from their usual behavior\n\n6. Now I have no clear pattern to follow. They could:\n   - Return to their paper/rock alternating pattern\n   - Continue with more unpredictable moves\n   - Start a new pattern\n\n7. Given the uncertainty, I need to make an educated guess. Their historical preference is still heavily toward paper (6/12 times), then rock (4/12 times), then scissors (2/12 times).\n\n8. Since they just played scissors (rare for them), they might return to their comfort zone of paper or rock.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors, betting they'll return to their most frequent move (paper) after the unusual scissors play.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

This could indicate they're returning to their previous behaviors or starting something new.\n\n6.

My opponent's sequence: paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. The alternating pattern continues! Looking at their last 6 moves: rock \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock. \n\n4. After the three rocks in a row (rounds 13-15), they've been alternating scissors and rock: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock.\n\n5. Their overall distribution: Paper (6 times), Rock (9 times), Scissors (4 times). Rock remains dominant.\n\n6. If the alternating pattern holds (scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), then after playing rock in round 19, they should play scissors in round 20.\n\n7. This alternating rock-scissors pattern has held for the last 4 moves, which suggests it's their current strategy.\n\n8. If they play scissors next, I should play rock to beat it.\n\n9. The pattern seems quite consistent now, so I'll exploit this alternating behavior.\n\nFinal decision: I will play rock to beat the expected scissors move in their rock-scissors alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The alternating pattern is perfect! Looking at their last 5 moves: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors. They are strictly alternating between rock and scissors.\n\n4. Their overall distribution: Paper (6 times), Rock (9 times), Scissors (5 times). Rock is still most frequent, but the rock-scissors alternating pattern is very consistent.\n\n5. Following this established alternating pattern, after playing scissors in round 20, they should play rock in round 21.\n\n6. This alternating rock-scissors pattern has now held for 5 consecutive rounds, making it highly predictable.\n\n7. If they play rock next (following the pattern), I should play paper to beat rock and win.\n\n8. The pattern has been so consistent that I'm confident they'll continue alternating.\n\nFinal decision: I will play paper to beat the expected rock move in their strict rock-scissors alternating pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The alternating pattern has broken again! They were alternating rock and scissors perfectly for 5 rounds, but instead of playing rock in round 21, they played paper.\n\n4. Their overall distribution: Paper (7 times), Rock (9 times), Scissors (5 times). Paper has increased, but rock is still most frequent.\n\n5. This is the second time they've broken a strong pattern:\n   - First broke the paper-rock alternating pattern at round 12 with scissors\n   - Now broke the rock-scissors alternating pattern at round 21 with paper\n\n6. They seem to recognize when I'm exploiting their patterns and deliberately break them.\n\n7. Since they just played paper and patterns have been unreliable, I need to make a strategic guess.\n\n8. They might return to their rock-scissors alternating pattern, or start something completely new.\n\n9. Given their overall preference for rock (9/21 rounds) and the fact that paper just tied, they might switch to rock or scissors.\n\n10. I'll play scissors, betting they might return to their most frequent move (rock) or continue with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I will play scissors, hedging between their rock preference and potential paper continuation.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Their recent moves after breaking the rock-scissors pattern: paper \u2192 scissors. This could be the start of a new pattern or random behavior.\n\n4.

They've now broken two strong patterns when I started exploiting them, suggesting they adapt to my predictions.\n\n6. Since they just played scissors and got a tie, they might:\n   - Continue with scissors\n   - Switch to rock (their most frequent move historically)\n   - Go to paper (continuing some new pattern)\n\n7. Given that they seem to be adapting and becoming less predictable, and that scissors just tied (not a loss), they might continue with it.\n\n8. But they could also return to rock, which has been their most reliable move overall.\n\n9. If they play rock, I should play paper. If they play scissors again, I should play rock.\n\n10.

Looking at their history, they tend to develop patterns and then break them when I exploit them.\n\n8. Rock just lost to my paper, so they might switch away from rock.\n\n9.
