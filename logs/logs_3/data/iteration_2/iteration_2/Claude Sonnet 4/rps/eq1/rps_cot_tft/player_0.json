    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

I need to analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Same moves result in a tie (0 points for both)\n\n2. Since this is against a \"fresh player\" (likely inexperienced), I should consider common patterns:\n   - New players often start with rock as it's the most intuitive first choice\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - Many beginners default to rock when uncertain\n\n3. If the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to beat it and gain +1 point.\n\n4. Even if I'm wrong about their choice, I have a 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of tying, and 1/3 chance of losing, so any move has the same expected value against a random opponent.\n\n5. However, the psychological tendency toward rock in new players gives paper a slight strategic advantage.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock choice from a fresh player.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Now I need to consider what they might do in round 2:\n   - They just lost with rock, so they might switch strategies\n   - Common beginner patterns after losing with rock include:\n     * Switching to paper (thinking \"paper beat me, so I'll use paper\")\n     * Switching to scissors (trying the third option)\n     * Sticking with rock (stubborn or thinking it was just bad luck)\n\n3. If they switch to paper (thinking it's now the \"winning\" move), I should play scissors to beat paper.\n\n4. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n5. If they stick with rock again, I should play paper again.\n\n6. Given that they just experienced paper beating rock, the most likely psychological response is to either try paper themselves or avoid rock. The tendency to copy the winning move is strong in beginners.\n\n7.

Now for round 3 prediction:\n   - They've played: rock, scissors\n   - They haven't played paper yet\n   - After a tie, beginners often either:\n     * Stick with the same move (scissors again)\n     * Try the move they haven't used yet (paper)\n     * Go back to their original move (rock)\n\n4.

Key observations:\n   - I correctly predicted scissors again - they switched after losing with rock\n   - Scissors is now their most used move (5 times)\n   - They just lost with scissors against my rock\n   - Paper remains heavily underused (only 1 time in 10 rounds)\n\n4. Pattern after losses with scissors:\n   - After losing with scissors in round 5, they went to scissors again (round 6)\n   - After losing with scissors in round 6, they went to paper (round 7)\n   - After losing with scissors in round 10, what will they do in round 11?\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They might switch to rock (their second most frequent choice)\n   - They might try paper again (drastically underused)\n   - They might stick with scissors despite losing\n   - Given paper is so underused and they've shown they will eventually try all moves, they might give paper another shot\n\n6. The fact that paper has only been used once in 10 rounds suggests they might finally use it more. If they play paper, I should counter with scissors.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors expecting them to finally use paper more frequently, given it's been severely underused compared to rock and scissors.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
