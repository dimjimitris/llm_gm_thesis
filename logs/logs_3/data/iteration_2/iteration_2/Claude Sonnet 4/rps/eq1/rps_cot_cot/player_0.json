    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since they chose paper in round 1, I need to consider what they might do next:\n   - They might stick with paper since it worked (didn't lose)\n   - They might switch to rock or scissors to try something different\n   - They might think I'll expect them to repeat paper and choose something else\n4. If they stick with paper again, I should choose scissors to beat it.\n5. If they switch to rock (thinking I might choose paper again), they would beat my scissors.\n6. If they switch to scissors, we'd tie if I also choose scissors.\n7. Given that they showed they're not predictably choosing rock, and paper was their first choice, there's a reasonable chance they might repeat it or I can exploit if they do.\n8.

Since we both seem to be overthinking and landing on the same logical conclusions, I should try to think less conventionally\n11. Looking at what we haven't done much of - we've had paper twice, scissors once, rock once\n12. Maybe I should go with scissors since it's been used least recently (only in round 2)\n13. Or perhaps the opponent will think the same way and also choose scissors, leading to another tie\n14.

At this point, I should probably just make a straightforward choice rather than trying to predict complex patterns.\n\n8. Since they just played rock, and looking at the frequency, they use paper most often.\n\n9. I'll go with a simple approach: play rock to beat scissors, which is their least used move, but if they go with their most frequent choice (paper), I'll lose.\n\n10. Actually, let me just pick randomly from my perspective - I'll go with paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, taking a more random approach since pattern prediction hasn't been working well.\n\n[move] paper\n"

The sample size is small, but they've switched to different moves after scissors (paper once, rock once).\n\n8. Since I'm behind by 2 points, I need to start winning. Let me make a simple choice.\n\n9. They just played scissors. If I expect them to switch (as they have after scissors before), they might go to paper or rock.\n\n10. I'll play rock - it beats scissors if they repeat, and beats scissors but loses to paper if they switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which covers me if they repeat scissors and gives me a 50-50 chance if they switch.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Complete game history including the most recent round:\n   - Rounds 1-4: All ties\n   - Round 5: I scissors, opponent paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 6: I paper, opponent rock (I won +1)\n   - Rounds 7-14: Various outcomes, mostly losses\n   - Round 15: I rock, opponent scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 16: I scissors, opponent paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 17: I paper, opponent scissors (I lost -1)\n   - Round 18: Both rock (tie)\n   - Round 19: I scissors, opponent paper (I won +1)\n   - Round 20: I rock, opponent scissors (I won +1)\n   - Round 21: Both paper (tie)\n\n2. My current total score is -1 point.\n\n3. The opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 18: rock\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: paper\n\n4. The cycle broke again! I expected rock based on the scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors pattern, but they played paper instead.\n\n5. So their actual sequence was: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper\n\n6. They played paper instead of the expected rock, which resulted in a tie since I also played paper.\n\n7. This is interesting - we both played paper, suggesting we might be thinking similarly again.\n\n8. Looking at their behavior after previous ties:\n   - After rock tie (round 18), they went to paper (round 19)\n   - Now after paper tie (round 21), what might they do?\n\n9. From the early game ties:\n   - After paper tie (round 1), they went to scissors (round 2)\n   - After paper tie (round 3), they went to rock (round 4)\n\n10. So after paper ties, they've gone to scissors once and rock once. No clear pattern.\n\n11. Since the cycle is broken and we just tied with paper, I need to make a fresh decision.\n\n12. I'll go with scissors, which beats paper if they stick with it, and has worked well for me in several winning rounds.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, hoping they repeat paper or just taking a calculated guess after the tie.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

My current total score is -2 points.\n\n3. The opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - Round 22: rock\n\n4. Their last 4 moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. I notice they seem to alternate between paper and other moves:\n   - paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n6. They just played rock and beat my scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their pattern, after rock they've previously gone to:\n   - After rock (round 4), they went to paper (round 5)\n   - After rock (round 6), they went to paper (round 7)\n   - After rock (round 9), they went to paper (round 10)\n   - After rock (round 11), they went to scissors (round 12)\n   - After rock (round 14), they went to scissors (round 15)\n   - After rock (round 18), they went to paper (round 19)\n\n8. So after rock, they've gone to paper 4 times and scissors 2 times.\n\n9. Paper is more likely after rock based on this historical pattern.\n\n10. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n11. I'm -2 points behind, so I need to start winning consistently again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting on their historical tendency to play paper after rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
