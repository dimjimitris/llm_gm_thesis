    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - Fresh/new players often have predictable patterns\n\n3. Think about common first-move tendencies:\n   - Many beginners tend to start with rock (it's often the first option people think of)\n   - Rock is psychologically associated with strength and aggression\n   - It's the first move mentioned in \"rock-paper-scissors\"\n\n4. Determine optimal counter-strategy:\n   - If opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper\n   - Paper beats rock, giving me +1 points and opponent -1 points\n   - This maximizes my advantage\n\n5. Consider the risk:\n   - If I'm wrong and they play scissors, I lose (-1 points)\n   - If they play paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - The potential reward (+1) outweighs the risk given my reasoning about fresh players\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to counter the likely rock move from a fresh player.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Analyze the previous round results:\n   - My prediction was correct - the fresh player did play rock\n   - I won with paper, confirming my initial strategy worked\n   - I gained +1 point\n\n2. Consider opponent's likely reaction:\n   - They just lost by playing rock against my paper\n   - Fresh players often have predictable responses to losses\n   - Common reactions include: switching to what beat them, or trying to counter what I played\n\n3. Analyze potential opponent strategies:\n   - They might switch to scissors (thinking I'll play paper again)\n   - They might play paper (copying my winning move)\n   - They might stick with rock (not learning from the loss)\n   - They might try rock again but expect me to switch\n\n4. Evaluate my best counter-moves:\n   - If they play scissors (most likely): I should play rock\n   - If they play paper: I should play scissors  \n   - If they play rock again: I should play paper again\n\n5. Determine the most probable opponent move:\n   - Fresh players often try to counter what just beat them\n   - Since paper beat their rock, they'll likely play scissors to beat paper\n   - This is a common beginner pattern - \"they played paper, so I'll play scissors\"\n\n6. Choose optimal response:\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I play rock to win\n   - Rock beats scissors, giving me another +1 point\n   - This continues my winning strategy\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter the likely scissors move from my opponent.\n\n[move] rock\n"
