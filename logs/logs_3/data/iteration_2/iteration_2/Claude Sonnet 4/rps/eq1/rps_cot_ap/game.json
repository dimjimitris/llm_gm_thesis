Analyze the pattern break:\n   - After 5 consecutive papers, my opponent finally switched to rock\n   - They may have realized I was consistently countering with scissors\n   - This suggests they're adapting and becoming less predictable\n\n3. Consider what this means going forward:\n   - They broke out of the paper streak, showing strategic awareness\n   - They might continue with rock or switch to something else\n   - The predictable patterns may be ending\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 11:\n   - If they stick with rock, I should choose paper\n   - If they go back to paper, I should choose scissors\n   - If they choose scissors, I should choose rock\n   - With no clear pattern now, I need to make an educated guess\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Since they just chose rock after a long paper streak, they might stick with rock briefly\n   - Paper beats rock and would be optimal if they continue with rock\n   - Given their pattern-breaking behavior, paper seems like a reasonable choice\n\n[move] (My opponent broke their paper streak by choosing rock, so they might continue with rock for a bit, and paper beats rock) paper\n"

Consider the streak length progression:\n   - Their first paper streak was 5 rounds\n   - Their rock streak was 4 rounds\n   - Their scissors streak was 4 rounds\n   - Current paper streak is at 4 rounds and might continue to 5 to match their first paper streak\n\n4. Evaluate my options for round 22:\n   - If they continue with paper (likely to match their original 5-round paper streak), scissors will beat it\n   - Four consecutive papers shows strong commitment, and they might aim for 5\n   - Scissors has been extremely effective, winning 4 straight rounds against their paper\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Four consecutive papers suggests they're aiming for a 5-round streak to match their first paper streak\n   - Their pattern of substantial streaks supports continuing with paper\n   - Scissors remains the optimal choice to exploit this predictable behavior\n\n[move] (My opponent has chosen paper four times in a row, possibly aiming for five rounds to match their original paper streak length, so scissors should continue to win) scissors\n"

Evaluate my options for round 23:\n   - If they continue with rock (following their streak pattern), paper will beat it\n   - If they're starting a new rock streak, paper is the optimal counter\n   - Given their history, they're likely to stick with rock for several rounds\n\n5. Make my strategic decision:\n   - They just switched from paper to rock, suggesting a new streak is starting\n   - Based on their pattern, they'll likely continue with rock for multiple rounds\n   - Paper beats rock and would be the optimal choice to exploit this new potential streak\n\n[move] (My opponent broke their paper streak by switching to rock, likely starting a new rock streak following their established pattern, so paper should beat rock) paper\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
