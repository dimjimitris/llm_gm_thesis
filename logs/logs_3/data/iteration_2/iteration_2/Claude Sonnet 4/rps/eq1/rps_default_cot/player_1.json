    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move (rock, paper, scissors) has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying.\n3. With a fresh player, there's no pattern to exploit yet, so any move is equally valid from a strategic standpoint.\n4. I need to pick one move to start gathering information about my opponent's playing style.\n5. Rock is a common first choice for many players, so I could either go with rock (if I think they'll avoid the obvious choice) or paper (to counter the common rock choice).\n6. I'll go with paper as it beats rock, which is often a default choice for new players.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper to potentially counter a common first move of rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Round 10: I played paper, opponent played paper - Tie (0 points)\n11. Current total: 1 point\n\n12. My opponent's sequence: rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper\n\n13. Analyzing their last few moves:\n    - Rounds 7-10: rock, paper, scissors, paper\n    - They didn't continue the rock-paper-scissors cycle as I expected\n    - Instead they played paper twice in their last two moves (rounds 9-10)\n\n14. Looking at their overall pattern:\n    - Rock: 4 times (rounds 1, 2, 4, 7)\n    - Scissors: 3 times (rounds 3, 5, 9)\n    - Paper: 3 times (rounds 6, 8, 10)\n    - They just played paper in back-to-back rounds (8 and 10)\n\n15. For round 11, I need to consider:\n    - They've now played paper twice in a row (rounds 8 and 10, with scissors in round 9)\n    - They might continue with paper (showing a new preference)\n    - They might switch to avoid being too predictable\n    - Historically, when they've repeated moves, it's been rock (rounds 1-2)\n\n16. If they continue with paper, I should play scissors to win.\n17. If they switch back to rock (their historical favorite), I should play paper.\n18. If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n\n19. Given that they just played paper twice in their last three moves, and they seem to sometimes stick with moves that work or feel comfortable, I think there's a good chance they'll play paper again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll continue their recent paper trend.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Looking at the most recent trend:\n    - Rounds 8-11: paper, scissors, paper, scissors\n    - This looks like they might be alternating between paper and scissors\n    - If this pattern continues, they should play paper next (round 12)\n\n16. Overall frequency check:\n    - Rock: 4 times\n    - Scissors: 4 times (including the tie we just had)\n    - Paper: 3 times\n\n17. For round 12, considering the alternating paper-scissors pattern:\n    - If they continue alternating, they should play paper next\n    - If they break the pattern, they might go back to rock (their early favorite)\n    - The alternating pattern seems strong in their last 4 moves\n\n18. If they play paper (following the alternating pattern), I should play scissors to win.\n19. If they play rock (breaking the pattern), I should play paper.\n\n20.

Overall frequency now:\n    - Rock: 5 times (rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 12)\n    - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 3, 5, 9, 11)\n    - Paper: 3 times (rounds 6, 8, 10)\n\n17. Rock is clearly their most frequent choice (5 out of 12 rounds = 42%)\n18. They seem to return to rock when breaking patterns or when uncertain\n\n19. Looking at their behavior:\n    - They often return to rock as a \"default\" choice\n    - They had some alternating patterns but broke them\n    - Rock appears to be their comfort zone\n\n20. For round 13, I need to predict their next move:\n    - They just played rock and it worked (they beat my scissors)\n    - They might stick with rock since it was successful\n    - Or they might switch to avoid being predictable\n    - Given rock's dominance in their play, there's a good chance they'll play it again\n\n21. If they play rock again, I should play paper to win.\n22. Even if they don't, paper beats rock and rock is their most likely choice statistically.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting on their rock preference/tendency.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Looking at their recent pattern:\n    - Rounds 11-13: scissors, rock, paper\n    - If they're doing a complete cycle, scissors would come next\n    - This would make it scissors-rock-paper-scissors\n\n19. I've noticed they sometimes do complete cycles:\n    - They've shown all three moves in their last three plays\n    - They might continue with scissors to complete another cycle\n\n20.

My opponent's sequence: rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock\n\n17. They went back to rock instead of playing scissors as I predicted. Let me analyze:\n    - Last 4 moves: scissors, rock, paper, rock (rounds 11-14)\n    - Rock frequency is now 6 times out of 14 rounds (43%)\n\n18. Updated frequency:\n    - Rock: 6 times (rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 14)\n    - Scissors: 4 times (rounds 3, 5, 9, 11)\n    - Paper: 4 times (rounds 6, 8, 10, 13)\n\n19. Rock is still their most dominant choice, and they just played it twice in the last 3 rounds (12 and 14).\n\n20. Looking at their pattern when they play rock:\n    - They often follow rock with rock (happened in rounds 1-2)\n    - But they also sometimes switch after rock\n    - Just played rock, so they might stick with it or switch\n\n21. For round 15, considering:\n    - Rock is their clear favorite (43% of all plays)\n    - They just played rock and might continue the trend\n    - They've shown a tendency to repeat successful moves\n    - The last tie with rock might encourage them to try rock again or switch\n\n22. Given their rock dominance and the fact that they just played rock (which tied), I think there are two likely scenarios:\n    - They stick with rock again (following their preference)\n    - They switch to try to break the tie pattern\n\n23. If they play rock, I should play paper. If they switch to scissors or paper, rock would beat scissors and tie with paper.\n\n24. I think their rock bias is strong enough that paper is the best bet.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting on their continued rock preference.\n\n[move] paper\n"

For round 19, I need to consider:\n   - They just played paper and won with it\n   - They might stick with paper since it's working\n   - Or they might switch to avoid being predictable\n   - Paper has been successful for them lately\n\n9. If they continue with paper, I should play scissors.\n10. If they go back to rock (their overall favorite), I should play paper.\n11. If they play scissors, I should play rock.\n\n12. Given that they played paper in rounds 16 and 18, and it's been successful for them recently, there's a reasonable chance they'll continue with paper.\n\n13. Also, they might expect me to expect them to go back to rock (since rock is their most frequent overall), so they might stick with paper to counter my potential paper play.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting they'll continue with their recent paper success.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Round 19: I played scissors, opponent played scissors - Tie (0 points)\n\n4. Updated frequency after 19 rounds:\n   - Rock: 7 times (rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 14, 17)\n   - Scissors: 6 times (rounds 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 19)\n   - Paper: 6 times (rounds 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18)\n\n5. Analyzing their recent pattern:\n   - Rounds 16-19: paper, rock, paper, scissors\n   - They switched from paper to scissors instead of continuing with paper as I expected\n\n6. Looking at their last 4 moves: paper, rock, paper, scissors\n   - This doesn't show a clear repeating pattern\n   - They seem to be mixing their moves more unpredictably now\n\n7. All three moves are now relatively balanced in frequency:\n   - Rock: 7/19 (37%)\n   - Scissors: 6/19 (32%) \n   - Paper: 6/19 (32%)\n\n8. For round 20, I need to consider:\n   - They just played scissors (tied with me)\n   - They might stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n   - Or they might switch since ties don't give points\n   - Rock is still their slight statistical favorite\n\n9. Looking at their behavior after ties:\n   - Round 2: rock-rock tie, then they played scissors (switched)\n   - Round 4: rock-rock tie, then they played scissors (switched) \n   - Round 8: paper-paper tie, then they played scissors (switched)\n   - Round 11: scissors-scissors tie, then they played rock (switched)\n\n10. Pattern after ties: They tend to switch moves after ties rather than repeat!\n\n11. Since we just tied with scissors, they'll likely switch to either rock or paper.\n12. Given that rock is still their most frequent choice overall, there's a good chance they'll go to rock.\n\n13. If they play rock, I should play paper.\n14. If they play paper, I should play scissors.\n\n15. Based on their tendency to switch after ties and rock being their most frequent choice, I think rock is most likely.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play paper, betting they'll switch from scissors to rock after our tie.\n\n[move] paper\n"

They played paper instead of rock as I predicted. Now all three moves are nearly balanced in frequency.\n\n6. Applying the pattern I've identified - they switch moves after ties:\n   - We just tied with paper in round 22\n   - Based on their consistent behavior after ties, they should switch to either rock or scissors\n\n7. Reviewing their post-tie switches:\n   - Round 2: rock-rock tie \u2192 switched to scissors\n   - Round 4: rock-rock tie \u2192 switched to scissors  \n   - Round 8: paper-paper tie \u2192 switched to scissors\n   - Round 11: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 switched to rock\n   - Round 19: scissors-scissors tie \u2192 switched to rock\n\n8. Pattern after ties:\n   - After rock ties: switched to scissors (2/2 times)\n   - After paper ties: switched to scissors (1/1 times)\n   - After scissors ties: switched to rock (2/2 times)\n\n9. We just had a paper-paper tie, and their only previous paper tie (round 8) resulted in them switching to scissors.\n\n10. This suggests they'll likely play scissors in round 23.\n\n11. If they play scissors, I should play rock to win.\n\n12. The pattern is very consistent: they switch after ties, and after paper ties they've gone to scissors.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, betting they'll switch from our paper tie to scissors, following their established pattern.\n\n[move] rock\n"
