Since we both seem to be overthinking and landing on the same logical conclusions, I should try to think less conventionally\n11. Looking at what we haven't done much of - we've had paper twice, scissors once, rock once\n12. Maybe I should go with scissors since it's been used least recently (only in round 2)\n13. Or perhaps the opponent will think the same way and also choose scissors, leading to another tie\n14.

I notice they've been quite unpredictable, but let me look for any small patterns:\n   - After playing scissors in round 2, they went to paper in round 3\n   - After playing scissors in round 8, they went to rock in round 9\n   - They just played scissors in round 12...\n\n7. The sample size is small, but they've switched to different moves after scissors (paper once, rock once).\n\n8. Since I'm behind by 2 points, I need to start winning. Let me make a simple choice.\n\n9. They just played scissors. If I expect them to switch (as they have after scissors before), they might go to paper or rock.\n\n10. I'll play rock - it beats scissors if they repeat, and beats scissors but loses to paper if they switch to paper.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play rock, which covers me if they repeat scissors and gives me a 50-50 chance if they switch.\n\n[move] rock\n"

My current total score is -2 points.\n\n3. The opponent's recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: paper\n   - Round 20: scissors\n   - Round 21: paper\n   - Round 22: rock\n\n4. Their last 4 moves: paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n5. I notice they seem to alternate between paper and other moves:\n   - paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n\n6. They just played rock and beat my scissors.\n\n7. Looking at their pattern, after rock they've previously gone to:\n   - After rock (round 4), they went to paper (round 5)\n   - After rock (round 6), they went to paper (round 7)\n   - After rock (round 9), they went to paper (round 10)\n   - After rock (round 11), they went to scissors (round 12)\n   - After rock (round 14), they went to scissors (round 15)\n   - After rock (round 18), they went to paper (round 19)\n\n8. So after rock, they've gone to paper 4 times and scissors 2 times.\n\n9. Paper is more likely after rock based on this historical pattern.\n\n10. If they play paper, I should play scissors to beat it.\n\n11. I'm -2 points behind, so I need to start winning consistently again.\n\nFinal decision: I'll play scissors, betting on their historical tendency to play paper after rock.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze their psychology after regaining a win:\n   - They just broke my winning streak\n   - They might feel confident about this strategic adjustment\n   - They could stick with this new approach or revert to old patterns\n\n6. Consider my options:\n   - I can't rely on their old counter-counter pattern anymore\n   - I need to think about what they might do with their fresh approach\n   - Their last move was paper - they might repeat it, counter it, or play randomly\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - Since they just successfully adapted and played paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they might play rock\n   - I'll play paper to beat rock\n\nFinal decision: Paper to beat rock, assuming they'll expect me to counter their successful paper with scissors.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Assess their strategic sophistication:\n   - They've shown they can break patterns when losing badly\n   - They can use counter-counter strategies effectively  \n   - They adapt when I start reading their strategies\n   - They're becoming a formidable opponent\n\n5. Consider their psychology after recent success:\n   - They've mostly been winning since adapting\n   - Success might make them more confident in their current approach\n   - They might stick with whatever strategy they think is working\n   - Or they might keep changing to stay unpredictable\n\n6. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they're following a new rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper cycle, next is paper\n   - If they're using counter-strategy, they might expect me to counter scissors\n   - If they expect rock from me (to beat scissors), they'd play paper\n   - Both approaches point to paper as their likely next move\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - Whether it's a new cycle or continued counter-strategy, paper seems most likely\n   - I'll play scissors to beat paper\n\nFinal decision: Scissors to beat paper, whether they're following a new cycle or expecting me to counter their previous scissors with rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

Analyze their recent dominance:\n   - Round 16: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 17: Paper (lost to my scissors) \n   - Round 18: Rock (tied with my rock)\n   - Round 19: Scissors (beat my paper)\n   - Round 20: Rock (beat my scissors)\n\n2. Look at their sequence since adapting:\n   - Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock\n   - This isn't following a simple cycle anymore\n   - But there might be a deeper pattern I'm missing\n\n3. Analyze their counter-strategy approach:\n   - Round 19: I played paper, they played scissors (beats paper)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, they played rock (beats scissors)\n   - They're consistently playing what beats my actual move\n   - This suggests they're successfully predicting what I'll play\n\n4. Consider how they might be reading me:\n   - They seem to anticipate my logical thinking\n   - When I expect paper from them, I play scissors, they play rock\n   - When I expect rock repeat, I play paper, they play scissors\n   - They're staying one step ahead of my predictions\n\n5. Recognize the meta-game level:\n   - I've been trying to predict their patterns\n   - They might be predicting my pattern-seeking behavior\n   - They play what beats what they expect me to play based on my analysis\n   - This is very sophisticated strategic thinking\n\n6. Consider their psychology:\n   - They're on a winning streak and feeling confident\n   - Their adaptations are working consistently\n   - They might be getting better at reading my strategic approach\n   - Success breeds more sophisticated play\n\n7. Plan a different approach:\n   - My pattern-based predictions aren't working anymore\n   - I need to be less predictable myself\n   - Maybe I should focus on simpler psychology rather than complex pattern analysis\n   - Their last move was rock - they might expect me to counter with paper\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - Instead of overthinking patterns, I'll consider basic psychology\n   - They just won with rock against my scissors\n   - Rock might feel successful to them, so they could repeat it\n   - I'll play paper to beat rock, using simpler logic\n\nFinal decision: Paper to beat rock, using straightforward psychology rather than complex pattern analysis.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - Both played paper (tie)\n   - I used simpler psychology (expecting rock repeat)\n   - They also chose paper, possibly with similar reasoning\n   - This breaks their recent pattern of staying ahead of me\n\n2. Consider why they played paper:\n   - They might have expected me to play rock (to counter their previous rock)\n   - They could be trying to counter-counter again\n   - Or they simplified their thinking like I did\n   - The tie suggests similar strategic reasoning\n\n3. Review the recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: They scissors, beat my paper\n   - Round 20: They rock, beat my scissors  \n   - Round 21: They paper, tied my paper\n   - Their dominance was broken by us thinking alike again\n\n4. Assess their likely reaction to the tie:\n   - Ties can be frustrating after a winning streak\n   - They might return to more complex counter-strategies\n   - Or they might stick with the simpler approach that produced the tie\n   - They could try to predict what I'll do after this tie\n\n5. Consider the psychological impact:\n   - After winning 4 of 5 rounds, a tie might feel like a step back\n   - They might want to regain their winning momentum\n   - This could lead to more aggressive prediction attempts\n   - Or they might play it safe with another potential tie\n\n6. Think about their next move:\n   - We both just played paper\n   - They might expect me to switch (since ties are unsatisfying)\n   - If they expect me to play rock or scissors, they'd counter accordingly\n   - Or they might expect me to repeat paper and try to counter it\n\n7. Make my decision:\n   - The tie suggests we're back to similar thinking patterns\n   - They might expect me to change from paper\n   - If they expect rock from me (common after paper), they'd play paper\n   - If they expect scissors from me, they'd play rock\n   - I'll go with rock, betting they expect me to avoid repeating paper\n\nFinal decision: Rock, assuming they expect me to switch away from paper after the tie and might play paper to counter my expected rock.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - I played rock, they played scissors\n   - I won after several losses and a tie\n   - They didn't play the paper I expected based on counter-counter logic\n   - They chose scissors instead\n\n2. Consider why they played scissors:\n   - They might have expected me to play paper (after our tie with paper)\n   - Scissors beats paper, so this would make sense\n   - But I played rock instead, which beats scissors\n   - Their prediction of my move was incorrect this time\n\n3. Review their recent performance:\n   - Had been winning 4 out of 5 rounds with sophisticated counter-strategies\n   - Then tied with paper when we both simplified our thinking\n   - Now lost with scissors when they expected me to play paper\n   - Their winning streak is broken\n\n4. Assess their likely psychological state:\n   - After dominating, they just lost unexpectedly\n   - The tie followed by a loss might create uncertainty\n   - They might question their recent successful strategies\n   - This could lead to either more conservative play or more aggressive adaptation\n\n5. Consider their strategic options:\n   - Return to their successful counter-counter approach\n   - Try to establish new patterns\n   - Become more unpredictable/random\n   - Try to read my patterns instead of just countering\n\n6. Predict their next move:\n   - My last move was rock\n   - They might expect me to repeat rock (success bias)\n   - If they expect rock, they'd play paper\n   - Or they might think I'll switch and play accordingly\n\n7. Think about the meta-game:\n   - I just succeeded by using simpler logic instead of complex pattern analysis\n   - They might adapt to this simpler approach\n   - Or they might return to their complex strategies that were working\n   - The key is staying unpredictable while they're uncertain\n\n8. Make my decision:\n   - They likely expect me to either repeat rock or switch predictably\n   - If they expect rock repeat, they'll play paper\n   - I'll play scissors to beat paper, betting on their logical counter-move\n\nFinal decision: Scissors to beat paper, assuming they'll counter my successful rock with paper.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
