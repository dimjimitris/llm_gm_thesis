    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

It offers the highest potential reward (+3 points)\n2. Many new players often default to Rock as their first choice\n3.

They played Scissors for only the third time. Their updated distribution:\n- Rock: 9 times (45%)\n- Paper: 8 times (40%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (15%)\n\nRecent pattern: Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors\n\nThey've now used all three moves in the last three rounds. This could indicate:\n1. They're trying to be completely unpredictable\n2. They're cycling through all options\n3. Random variation\n\nGiven that they just used Scissors (rare for them) and we tied, they might:\n- Go back to Rock (their most frequent choice)\n- Try Paper (second most frequent)\n- Continue with Scissors (least likely given their pattern)\n\nSince Rock is their most frequent overall choice and they tend to return to it after experimenting, I think Paper gives me the best shot at the high-value +3 point win.\n\nIf they play Rock: Paper wins (+3 points)\nIf they play Paper: We tie (0 points)\nIf they play Scissors: I lose (-1 point)\n\nThe potential +3 reward makes this worth the risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Their updated distribution:\n- Rock: 10 times (48%)\n- Paper: 8 times (38%)\n- Scissors: 3 times (14%)\n\nRock remains their clear favorite. I keep getting burned when I try to capitalize on this with Paper (-3 points each time). The safer approach has been Scissors, which gives me +1 when they play Rock and only costs -1 when they counter with Paper.\n\nGiven their Rock tendency and my poor performance with high-risk Paper plays, I'll return to the more conservative Scissors strategy.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
