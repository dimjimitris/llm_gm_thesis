    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Rock beats Paper: Winner gets +3, Loser gets -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: Winner gets +1, Loser gets -1\n- Ties give 0 points to both players\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who has no information about my strategy, I should consider what a new player might choose. Many beginners tend to start with Rock as it's often the first option people think of in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that Rock beats Paper with the highest payoff (+3 points), and if there's a reasonable chance the opponent might choose Rock, I should avoid Paper. Between Rock and Scissors, if I choose Scissors and the opponent chooses Rock, I win +1 points. If I choose Rock and they choose Paper, I lose -3 points.\n\nFor this first move against a fresh player, I'll go with Scissors to potentially capitalize on a common Rock opening while avoiding the high penalty risk.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They might stick with Scissors again\n2. They might switch to counter what they think I'll do\n3. They might choose randomly\n\nIf they stick with Scissors again, I should choose Rock to beat them and earn +3 points (the highest possible reward). If they think I might repeat Scissors, they might choose Rock to counter me, in which case my Rock would tie with theirs (0 points). If they choose Paper thinking I'll go with Rock, then my Rock would lose -3 points.\n\nHowever, the potential reward of +3 points for Rock beating Scissors is quite attractive, and there's a reasonable chance they might repeat their previous move or expect me to repeat mine.

This is revealing a pattern in how we're both thinking.\n\nIt seems like we might both be following similar logic: after the Scissors tie, we both switched to Rock (perhaps thinking the other would stick with Scissors). Now I need to think about what they might do after this Rock tie.\n\nThe sequence so far: Scissors (tie), Rock (tie)\n\nIf they're thinking strategically, they might expect me to choose Paper next (since that would beat Rock if they repeated it). Or they might think I'll try Scissors again to complete some kind of cycle.\n\nGiven the pattern, I think there's a good chance they might choose Paper next, either because:\n1. They expect me to repeat Rock and want to beat it for +3 points\n2. They're following a Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper progression\n\nIf they choose Paper, I should choose Scissors to beat it and earn +1 point. This also breaks the tie pattern we've established.\n\nThe risk is if they choose Rock again (tie, 0 points) or if they choose Scissors (I lose -1 point).
