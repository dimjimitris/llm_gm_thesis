Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 vs -1\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 vs -3  \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 vs -1\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n2. Identify the key insight: Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses.\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have a developed strategy yet. Fresh players often:\n   - Choose rock frequently (it feels strong/aggressive)\n   - Avoid complex thinking and go with instinct\n   - May default to rock as the \"obvious\" choice\n\n4. Evaluate my options against a likely rock play:\n   - If I play paper vs their rock: I win +3 points\n   - If I play rock vs their rock: Tie, 0 points\n   - If I play scissors vs their rock: I lose -1 point\n\n5. Risk assessment: Playing paper gives me the best expected value if they choose rock (which is likely), and even if they don't choose rock, my maximum loss is only -1 point.\n\nFinal decision: Paper maximizes my expected points against a fresh player who is likely to choose rock.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Re-read the rules carefully:\n   - \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n   - So paper does beat scissors! I had this right initially.\n\n3. What this tells me about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors, not rock as I predicted\n   - This suggests they might not be following the \"fresh player chooses rock\" pattern\n   - They may be thinking more strategically or randomly\n\n4. Consider opponent's possible next move:\n   - They lost with scissors, so they might avoid it\n   - They might switch to rock (thinking it's stronger)\n   - They might try paper (since it just won for me)\n   - Or they could stick with scissors thinking I won't expect it twice\n\n5. Evaluate my options:\n   - If they play rock: Paper wins me +3 points (best outcome)\n   - If they play paper: Rock wins me +3 points  \n   - If they play scissors: Rock wins me +1 point\n\n6.

What I've learned about my opponent:\n   - Round 1: They chose scissors\n   - Round 2: They chose rock (same as me)\n   - They might be following me, or this could be coincidence\n   - They seem to be varying their moves rather than sticking to one strategy\n\n3. Consider possible opponent psychology:\n   - After a tie, they might think I'll stick with rock\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from rock\n   - They've now used scissors and rock, so paper is the remaining option they haven't tried\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: Paper wins me +3 points\n   - If they play paper (the move they haven't tried): Rock wins me +3 points\n   - If they play scissors (going back to round 1): Rock wins me +1 point\n\n5.

Update my score:\n   - Previous total: +5 points\n   - Round 10: Won +1 point\n   - Current total: +6 points\n\n2. Analyze the complete pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0)\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0)\n   - Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+3)\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1)\n   - Round 8: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1)\n\n3. Opponent's complete pattern:\n   - Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors\n   - Pattern: S-R-R-S-P-S-S-S-S-S\n   - Scissors: 7 times, Rock: 2 times, Paper: 1 time\n\n4. Remarkable observations:\n   - They just played scissors for the FIFTH time in a row (rounds 6-10)\n   - Scissors now accounts for 7 out of 10 rounds (70% of the time)\n   - They are completely locked into scissors strategy\n   - My paper counter-strategy has won 5 rounds in a row against their scissors\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - This is no longer random play - they have a clear scissors preference\n   - They haven't adapted despite losing consistently to my paper\n   - Either they don't understand the counter-relationship or are stubbornly sticking to their strategy\n   - My paper strategy is extremely effective\n\n6. Consider potential changes:\n   - They might finally realize they need to switch from scissors\n   - Rock would be the logical counter to my successful paper strategy\n   - But their pattern suggests they're very resistant to change\n   - Paper would be unexpected from them (only played once)\n\n7. Evaluate my options:\n   - Paper vs their expected scissors: I win +1 point (highly likely)\n   - Paper vs rock (if they adapt): I win +3 points (even better)\n   - Paper vs paper (if they copy me): Tie for 0 points (unlikely but neutral)\n\n8. Strategic reasoning:\n   - Five scissors in a row shows incredible commitment to that move\n   - My counter-strategy is working perfectly\n   - Even if they finally adapt to rock, I benefit even more\n   - There's no reason to deviate from a winning formula\n\nFinal decision: Continue with paper - their scissors pattern is so strong and my counter is so effective.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Update my score:\n   - Previous total: +6 points\n   - Round 11: Lost -3 points\n   - Current total: +3 points\n\n2. Analyze what just happened:\n   - They FINALLY switched from scissors to rock after 5 straight scissors\n   - This was their first strategic adaptation in the entire game\n   - They successfully countered my paper strategy with rock\n   - This cost me 3 points - the biggest single loss possible\n\n3. Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's pattern: S-R-R-S-P-S-S-S-S-S-R\n   - Scissors: 7 times, Rock: 3 times, Paper: 1 time\n   - They broke their 5-round scissors streak with rock\n\n4. Strategic implications:\n   - They've shown they CAN adapt when losing consistently\n   - They might expect me to continue with paper and play rock again\n   - Or they might think I'll switch away from paper now\n   - They could return to scissors (their preferred move)\n\n5. Consider their psychology:\n   - They just won big (+3) with rock vs my paper\n   - This success might encourage them to play rock again\n   - Or they might think \"mission accomplished\" and return to scissors\n   - They've now used rock to counter my successful paper strategy\n\n6. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - If they play rock again: Scissors wins +1 point\n   - If they return to scissors: Paper wins +1 point  \n   - If they try paper: Rock wins +3 points\n\n7.

Risk assessment:\n   - Scissors vs rock: +1 point (good if they repeat rock)\n   - Scissors vs scissors: 0 points (neutral)\n   - Scissors vs paper: -1 point (small loss, manageable)\n\nFinal decision: Switch to scissors to counter their likely rock repeat and break out of the paper pattern they just countered.\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Analyze what just happened:\n   - They switched from rock (round 11) to paper (round 12)\n   - This shows they're now actively adapting and changing strategies\n   - They've used all three moves in their last three plays: S-R-P\n   - They're no longer predictably stuck on scissors\n\n3. Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's pattern: S-R-R-S-P-S-S-S-S-S-R-P\n   - Last 3 moves: Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper (they're cycling!)\n   - Scissors: 7 times, Rock: 3 times, Paper: 2 times\n\n4.

Complete pattern analysis:\n   - Opponent's pattern: S-R-R-S-P-S-S-S-S-S-R-P-R\n   - Recent moves show more variation: S-S-S-S-S-R-P-R\n   - Scissors: 7 times, Rock: 4 times, Paper: 2 times\n   - Rock is becoming more frequent in their recent play\n\n4.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
