Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - The other winning moves only give +1 point\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no history to analyze\n   - Against an inexperienced player, they might choose randomly or go with common first moves\n   - Many new players tend to choose rock as their first move (it's often seen as \"strong\")\n\n4. Evaluate my best opening strategy:\n   - If opponent chooses rock (common for new players), I should choose paper to win +1\n   - If opponent chooses paper, I should choose scissors to win +1  \n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I should choose rock to win +3\n   - Since rock gives me the highest potential reward (+3), and scissors is less commonly chosen by new players, rock seems like a good strategic choice\n\n5. Make decision:\n   - Rock offers the best risk/reward ratio for an opening move against an unknown opponent\n\n[move] rock\n"

Consider my options for round 2:\n   - If opponent sticks with rock: I should play paper (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to paper (expecting me to play rock again): I should play scissors (+1 point)\n   - If opponent switches to scissors (less likely): I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n4. Evaluate the most likely scenario:\n   - New players often either stick with their first choice or switch to what would have beaten their opponent's last move\n   - Since we both played rock, they might switch to paper (thinking I'll play rock again)\n   - Playing scissors would beat their paper and give me +1 point\n\n5.

Strategic decision:\n   - They've played scissors twice in a row now\n   - Breaking my rock pattern with paper just worked\n   - But now they might expect me to avoid rock\n   - Rock gives maximum points and counters their recent scissors trend\n   - Worth the risk given my positive position\n\n[move] rock\n"

Notice opponent's latest behavior:\n   - They're now varying their moves more frequently\n   - No clear long streaks like before\n   - They seem to be avoiding predictable patterns\n\n4. Consider opponent's adaptation:\n   - They may have learned that long streaks are exploitable\n   - They're mixing up their strategy more\n   - This makes them harder to predict but also less committed to any single approach\n\n5. Evaluate my strategic position:\n   - I'm still ahead by +2 points\n   - The opponent is becoming less predictable\n   - I need to avoid becoming predictable myself\n\n6. Strategic decision:\n   - Since opponent just played rock and we tied\n   - They might switch away from rock expecting me to counter\n   - Or they might stick with rock thinking I'll change\n   - Scissors beats rock (+1) and also beats paper (+1)\n   - Paper beats rock (+1) but loses to scissors (-1)\n   - Scissors seems like a balanced choice that covers multiple scenarios well\n\n[move] scissors\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
