    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

The opponent also played Paper, which suggests they might have similar strategic thinking or also anticipated that Rock would be a common first move. This gives us valuable information - they're not playing completely randomly and may understand the payoff structure.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that they played Paper indicates:\n1. They may have strategic awareness\n2. They could be thinking one level ahead like us\n3. They might continue with Paper thinking we'll switch\n4. Or they might switch knowing we both played the same move\n\nStrategic Analyst: Now we have a few options:\n- If they stick with Paper (thinking we'll change), we should play Scissors for +1 point\n- If they switch to Rock (high risk/reward play), we should stick with Paper for +3\n- If they switch to Scissors (countering their own Paper), we should play Rock for +3\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that they showed strategic thinking by playing Paper first, I think they're likely to either:\n1.

Both rounds ended in ties with the same moves: Paper-Paper, then Rock-Rock. This opponent is either:\n1. Thinking very similarly to us\n2. Using a mirror strategy\n3. Following the same logical progression we are\nThis suggests they're quite strategic, not a typical \"fresh\" player.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Two ties in a row is statistically unlikely if playing randomly (about 11% chance). The opponent is definitely using strategy. They seem to be following similar logic - Paper first (anti-Rock), then Rock second (anti-Scissors prediction).\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they're thinking like us, they might predict we'll now play Scissors (completing the cycle). But they could also think we'll stick with high-value Rock again, or return to Paper. The pattern suggests they're one step ahead or perfectly synchronized with our thinking.\n\nPsychology Expert: Players who mirror often continue the pattern or break it deliberately. Since we've had Paper, Rock, the logical next in sequence would be Scissors. But a strategic player might expect this and play Rock to counter our Scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Let me think about this differently. If they continue mirroring, they'll play whatever we play. If they're trying to counter our next logical move (Scissors), they'll play Rock. If they think we'll stick with Rock again, they'll play Paper.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given the mirroring pattern, I think they're either:\n1. Going to play Scissors (continuing the cycle)\n2. Going to play Paper (expecting us to stick with Rock)\n\nStrategic Analyst: If we play Scissors and they mirror with Scissors, it's another tie. If we play Paper and they play Scissors (cycle continuation), we lose 1 point. If we play Paper and they play Paper (expecting our Rock), it's a tie. But if we play Paper and they play Rock (sticking with high value), we get +3 points.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Paper seems like the safest high-reward play here. It covers the most likely scenarios favorably.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Two ties suggest opponent thinks strategically like me, Paper covers most scenarios well including beating Rock if they stick with high-value plays) paper\n"

The opponent played Rock after we both played Paper, then Rock in the first two rounds. They broke the mirroring pattern and went with the high-risk, high-reward move. This suggests they're either:\n1. More aggressive than we thought\n2. Recognized the mirroring pattern and deliberately broke it\n3. Defaulting to Rock when uncertain\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent's sequence was: Paper, Rock, Rock. They seem to favor Rock - it appeared in 2 out of 3 rounds. This could indicate they're willing to take the high-risk/high-reward approach more often than we anticipated.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Key insights:\n- They're not purely mirroring us\n- They seem comfortable with Rock's risk/reward profile\n- They may be expecting us to play defensively after losing 3 points\n- We're now at -3 points, so we need to recover\n\nPsychology Expert: After a big loss, many players become either more conservative (to avoid further losses) or more aggressive (to quickly recover). The opponent might expect us to play it safe, which could mean they'll continue with Rock or switch to Scissors expecting us to play Paper defensively.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue favoring Rock, we should play Paper for the +3 recovery. If they think we'll play Paper defensively, they might switch to Scissors, in which case Rock would win us +3.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given their Rock preference (2/3 rounds) and the psychology of expecting defensive play after our loss, I lean toward Paper. It directly counters their favored move and gets us back to even.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The pattern shows they like Rock more than expected. Playing Paper gives us the best chance to recover our lost points if they stick with their preferred high-value move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent has shown preference for Rock appearing in 2 of 3 rounds, Paper counters this for maximum recovery points) paper\n"

This suggests they may be alternating or following some pattern, not purely random.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent's moves show: Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper. They've played Paper twice and Rock twice. After playing Rock twice in a row, they returned to Paper. This could indicate they're cycling or responding to perceived patterns in our play.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Let's think about what they might expect from us next:\n- We've played Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper (3 Papers, 1 Rock)\n- We clearly favor Paper (appeared 3/4 times)\n- They might expect us to continue with Paper or switch to break our own pattern\n\nPsychology Expert: After another tie, both players might be getting frustrated with the stalemate. The opponent might think we're being too predictable with Paper and could switch to Scissors to counter our apparent Paper preference.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they think we'll play Paper again (since we've played it 3/4 times), they'd logically play Scissors for the +1 points. In that case, we should play Rock to counter their Scissors for +3 points.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Rock makes sense here.

The opponent seems to be thinking very similarly to us or is deliberately creating these mirror situations.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The tie frequency is remarkable - 4 ties out of 5 rounds, with only one decisive round where they beat us with Rock vs our Paper. This suggests either:\n1. We're both using very similar strategic thinking\n2. One of us is deliberately mirroring\n3. We're both overthinking and ending up at the same conclusions\n\nStrategic Analyst: Let's analyze their decision pattern:\n- Round 1: Mirrored our Paper\n- Round 2: Mirrored our Rock  \n- Round 3: Played Rock (when we played Paper - their only win)\n- Round 4: Played Paper (when we played Paper)\n- Round 5: Mirrored our Rock again\n\nThey seem to mirror us most of the time, except when they think they can win.\n\nPsychology Expert: After 4 ties and being down -3 points total, both players are probably getting impatient.

Given we just played Rock, they might expect us to cycle to Scissors next.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Here's my thinking: if they expect us to play Scissors (breaking from our Rock), they'd play Rock to beat us for +3. We should counter this by playing Paper to beat their expected Rock.\n\nAI Assistant (me): The opponent has shown they can break from mirroring when they see an opportunity (Round 3).

This suggests they were trying to counter our apparent Paper preference, but we correctly predicted this counter-move.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Important shift in dynamics! We're now at -2 total points (-3 + 1). The opponent has shown they will deviate from mirroring when they think they can win. Their Scissors play shows they recognized our Paper frequency and tried to exploit it.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Now they know we successfully predicted their counter-move.

This suggests mirroring is their primary strategy with occasional breaks to try to win.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at -2 total points. The opponent seems to use mirroring as a defensive strategy while looking for opportunities to break and score. They successfully broke once (+3 for them) and we successfully counter-predicted once (+1 for us).\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent's decision pattern shows:\n- Default to mirroring (safe, prevents losses)\n- Break when they think they can predict our move\n- They broke in Round 3 (Rock when we played Paper) - success\n- They broke in Round 6 (Scissors when we played Paper) - failed\n\nThis suggests they look for patterns in our play to exploit.\n\nPsychology Expert: After returning to mirroring with Rock, they might be feeling more cautious. However, they've now seen us successfully predict their counter-move once, so they know we're thinking strategically too.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue mirroring, they'll play whatever they think we'll play.

Looking at our sequence: Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock - we've played each move multiple times without a clear cycle.\n\nStrategic Analyst: They might think:\n1. We'll continue with Rock (just played it)\n2. We'll cycle to Scissors (haven't played it yet)\n3. We'll return to Paper (our most frequent move - 4/7 times)\n\nIf they mirror, any move ties. If they expect Rock and mirror, we tie. If they expect Scissors and want to counter, they'd play Rock (we should play Paper). If they expect Paper and want to counter, they'd play Scissors (we should play Rock).\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that we haven't played Scissors once in 7 rounds, they might expect us to finally play it for variety. If they think we'll play Scissors, they'd counter with Rock. We should play Paper to beat their expected Rock counter.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, our complete avoidance of Scissors is noticeable. They might expect us to \"complete the set\" or add variety.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (I haven't played Scissors in any of the 7 rounds, opponent might expect me to finally use it and counter with Rock, so Paper beats their expected Rock) paper\n"

They seem to be stuck in a pattern of trying to counter our Paper preference with Scissors.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Great progress! We're now at -1 total points (-3 +1 +1). The opponent has shown a clear pattern:\n- Default to mirroring for safety\n- When they break, they play Scissors to counter our frequent Paper use\n- They've tried Scissors twice when breaking, both times unsuccessfully\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is a crucial psychological moment. The opponent has now failed twice with the same counter-strategy (Scissors vs our Paper). They might:\n1. Try Scissors a third time (stubborn/frustrated)\n2. Switch to a different counter (Rock to beat expected Scissors)\n3. Return to safe mirroring\n4. Try the one move they haven't used as a counter yet in their breaks\n\nPsychology Expert: After two failed Scissors attempts, they're likely frustrated. They might think we're always one step ahead. This could make them either more unpredictable or cause them to overthink and make the same mistake again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Looking at their breaks from mirroring:\n- Round 3: Rock (won against our Paper)\n- Round 6: Scissors (lost to our Paper) \n- Round 8: Scissors (lost to our Paper)\n\nThey've never tried breaking with Paper. If they break again, they might try Rock (which worked before) or finally try Paper.\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they try Rock (their successful break move), we should play Paper for +3. If they try Scissors again (frustrated repeat), we should play Rock for +3. If they try Paper (new break strategy), we should play Scissors for +1.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their pattern, I think they'll either:\n1. Try Rock again (since it worked in Round 3)\n2. Stubbornly try Scissors a third time\n\nRock covers both scenarios optimally - it beats Scissors for +3 and only loses to Paper (which they rarely use when breaking).\n\nPsychology Expert: After two failed Scissors attempts, Rock seems like their logical fallback since it was their only successful break move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent has failed twice with Scissors when breaking from mirroring, likely to try Rock again since it worked before, or repeat Scissors stubbornly, Rock beats both scenarios well) rock\n"

This suggests they might be getting more cautious after losing twice in a row when they tried to break the pattern. They're back to their safe mirroring strategy.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at -1 total points. The opponent's pattern is now clear:\n- Mirror most of the time (6 out of 9 rounds)\n- Break occasionally to try to score\n- When breaking, they've used Rock (successful once) and Scissors (failed twice)\n- They just returned to mirroring after consecutive failures\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent seems to be in a defensive mindset right now. After two failed breaks, they went back to safe mirroring. This could mean:\n1. They'll continue mirroring for a while to avoid further losses\n2. They're planning their next break more carefully\n3. They're waiting to see what we do next\n\nPsychology Expert: Players often mirror when they feel uncertain or want to reset after failures. The opponent might be trying to \"read\" us better before attempting another break. They could be waiting for us to establish a new pattern they can exploit.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue mirroring, we need to think about what move gives us the best position for when they eventually break again. They seem to favor Scissors when breaking (despite failures), but Rock worked for them once.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Here's a key insight - we still haven't played Scissors even once in 9 rounds! This is extremely noticeable. The opponent might be expecting us to finally use it, either because:\n1. We want to complete the set\n2. We want to be less predictable\n3. We think they'll expect Paper and want to counter\n\nAI Assistant (me): Our complete avoidance of Scissors is probably driving their Scissors attempts - they keep expecting us to use it and try to counter with Rock, but end up playing Scissors themselves when we stick with Paper. \n\nIf they think we'll finally play Scissors (to be unpredictable), they might try Rock to counter it. We should play Paper to beat their Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, our Scissors avoidance is creating a psychological expectation.

After their two failed Scissors breaks (Rounds 6 and 8), they've returned to mirroring for the last 2 rounds. This suggests they're being more cautious and defensive.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at -1 total points. The opponent's strategy seems to be:\n- Mirror as the default safe strategy (70% of the time)\n- Break occasionally when they think they can predict us\n- After failures, return to mirroring to reset\n\nThe key insight is that they're getting predictable in their unpredictability - they mirror most of the time and break with specific moves when they do deviate.\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent might be getting frustrated with all these ties. We've had 7 ties total out of 10 rounds, with only 3 decisive rounds:\n- Round 3: They won with Rock vs our Paper (+3 for them)\n- Round 6: We won with Paper vs their Scissors (+1 for us) \n- Round 8: We won with Paper vs their Scissors (+1 for us)\n\nThey're probably eager to break the tie pattern and score points.\n\nPsychology Expert: After two consecutive mirrors (Rounds 9-10), the opponent might feel it's time to break again. They know we're good at predicting their Scissors attempts, so they might try a different approach. They could:\n1. Try Rock again (it worked once before)\n2. Try Paper for the first time as a break move\n3. Stubbornly try Scissors again\n\nGame Theory Expert: I noticed something important - when they break from mirroring, they've never tried Paper as their break move. They've only used Rock (successful) and Scissors (failed twice). Paper might be their next experiment.\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they try Paper as a break move (expecting us to play Rock or something else), we should play Scissors for +1. If they try Rock again (their successful break move), we should play Paper for +3. If they try Scissors again, we should play Rock for +3.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given that they've never tried Paper as a break move, and they might think we don't expect it, I think there's a good chance they'll try Paper. Also, our complete avoidance of Scissors (still 0 in 10 rounds) makes Scissors a good choice to finally break our own pattern while countering their potential Paper break.\n\nPsychology Expert: Using Scissors would also be psychologically surprising since we've avoided it completely. It could catch them off guard if they're still expecting Paper from us.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Scissors\n\n[move] (I've avoided Scissors for 10 straight rounds making it unexpected, and opponent has never tried Paper as break move but might try it now, Scissors beats Paper and breaks my own predictable pattern) scissors\n"

This suggests we might be thinking very similarly, or the opponent has been waiting for the right moment to use Scissors just like we were.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at -1 total points. The opponent has now mirrored us in 8 out of 11 rounds. But this Scissors tie is particularly interesting because:\n1. It was both players' first use of Scissors\n2. We both \"saved\" it for the same moment\n3. This suggests very similar strategic thinking\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent's mirroring rate is now 8/11 (about 73%). Their break attempts have been:\n- Round 3: Rock (won)\n- Round 6: Scissors (lost) \n- Round 8: Scissors (lost)\n- Round 11: Not a break - they mirrored our Scissors\n\nThis means they haven't actually tried to break from mirroring in the last 3 rounds. They might be building up to another break attempt.\n\nPsychology Expert: The fact that we both played Scissors simultaneously is psychologically significant. The opponent might think:\n1. \"We think exactly alike\" - leading to more mirroring\n2. \"They finally used Scissors, now they might use it more\" - leading to Rock counters\n3. \"That was weird, let me try something different\" - leading to a break attempt\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they think we'll continue with Scissors now that we've broken our avoidance, they might play Rock to counter. If they think we'll go back to our Paper preference, they might try Scissors to counter. If they continue mirroring, they'll play whatever they think we'll play.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Given that we just used Scissors for the first time, they might expect us to either:\n1. Continue with Scissors (finally embracing it)\n2. Return to Paper (our most frequent move - 5/11 times)\n3.

The synchronization is becoming very strong, especially in recent rounds. After both playing Scissors for the first time simultaneously, we both chose Rock. This suggests we're thinking almost identically at this point.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We're still at -1 total points. The opponent's mirroring rate is now 75% (9/12). What's particularly striking is that in the last 4 rounds, we've had 3 ties and only 1 break attempt from them (which failed). They seem to be settling into mirroring as their primary strategy.\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent's recent behavior shows:\n- Rounds 9-12: Rock (mirror), Paper (mirror), Scissors (mirror), Rock (mirror)\n- They haven't attempted a break in 4 rounds\n- The synchronized Scissors play seems to have reinforced their mirroring tendency\n- They might be thinking \"if we think this similarly, mirroring is safe\"\n\nPsychology Expert: This level of synchronization can create a psychological loop where both players think \"they're thinking like me, so they'll do what I would do.\" This can lead to even more mirroring. However, the opponent might also be getting frustrated with all these ties and may be planning a break.\n\nGame Theory Expert: If they continue this strong mirroring trend, any move we make will likely be matched. However, if they decide to break, they historically favor:\n1. Rock (worked once)\n2. Scissors (failed twice, but they might try again)\n3. Paper (never tried as a break move)\n\nStrategic Analyst: Here's a key insight - we've been getting better at predicting their breaks (2 wins vs their break attempts), so they might be more hesitant to break.

They didn't follow their usual pattern of mirroring after a failed break\n2. They went with Scissors (which had failed twice before) but it worked this time\n3. They might be getting more aggressive, trying to score points faster\n4.

This represents a major shift in their strategy. They're clearly frustrated with ties and are taking bigger risks to try to score.\n\nPsychology Expert: After losing with their first-ever Paper break attempt, the opponent might:\n1. Continue the aggressive pattern with another break\n2. Briefly return to mirroring to reset (though this seems less likely given their new pattern)\n3. Cycle back to Rock or Scissors (their more familiar break moves)\n\nGame Theory Expert: With three consecutive breaks, they're showing they're committed to this new aggressive strategy. Since they just lost with Paper (their newest break move), they might return to Rock or Scissors which they're more comfortable with.\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they continue breaking, they have:\n1. Rock (1 win, 1 loss as break moves)\n2. Scissors (1 win, 2 losses as break moves)  \n3. Paper (0 wins, 1 loss as break moves)\n\nRock has their best success rate as a break move, so they might try it again.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Given their new ultra-aggressive pattern (3 consecutive breaks) and the fact that Rock has been their most successful break move (50% success rate), they'll likely try Rock again.

Rock is their comfort zone for breaking.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Paper also protects us well - it beats their most likely move (Rock) for maximum points and only loses to Scissors.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent in new ultra-aggressive mode with 3 consecutive breaks, Rock is their most successful break move so likely to repeat it, Paper beats Rock for maximum 3 points) paper\n"

Updated sequences:\nUs: Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper\nOpponent: Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors\n\nWe're now at +3 total points (+2 + 1)! The opponent is in full aggressive mode - this is their FOURTH consecutive break attempt! They went with Scissors instead of Rock, but we still won. Their break pattern shows:\n- Round 13: Rock (lost)\n- Round 14: Scissors (won) \n- Round 15: Paper (lost)\n- Round 16: Scissors (lost)\n\nStrategic Analyst: The opponent has completely abandoned mirroring (their last mirror was Round 12) and is now breaking every single round. This is extremely aggressive behavior, likely driven by desperation to catch up in points. They're cycling through their break moves rapidly.\n\nGame Theory Expert: We've now successfully countered 5 out of 7 total break attempts! Our prediction accuracy is excellent. The opponent's current break sequence is Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors, showing they're cycling through moves but favoring Scissors (appeared twice in last 4 breaks).\n\nPsychology Expert: After four consecutive failed break attempts in this aggressive phase, the opponent must be getting very frustrated. They might:\n1. Continue the ultra-aggressive pattern (5th consecutive break)\n2. Finally return to mirroring to stop the bleeding\n3. Try Rock again (their most successful historical break move)\n4. Get even more desperate and unpredictable\n\nStrategic Analyst: If they continue breaking, their recent pattern suggests:\n- They just played Scissors twice in the last 4 breaks\n- They might cycle to Rock or Paper next\n- Rock has been their best break move historically (1-1 record vs 1-3 for Scissors, 0-1 for Paper)\n\nGame Theory Expert: Given their desperation and the fact that Rock has their best break success rate, they might return to Rock. Also, after losing 3 consecutive breaks, they might think we don't expect them to continue this aggressive pattern.\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're in complete desperation mode with 4 straight breaks. They might either try Rock again (their best break move) or possibly return to mirroring to stop losing. If they try Rock, Paper beats it for +3. If they mirror, they'd copy what they think we'll play.\n\nPsychology Expert: Four consecutive losses while breaking suggests they'll either double down with their best move (Rock) or panic and try to reset with mirroring.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Paper covers the Rock scenario perfectly and keeps us in great position regardless of their choice.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Paper\n\n[move] (Opponent in desperation with 4 consecutive failed breaks, likely to try Rock again as their most successful break move, or return to mirroring, Paper beats Rock for 3 points and maintains advantage) paper\n"

Updated sequences:\nUs: Paper, Rock, Paper, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Paper\nOpponent: Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Scissors, Rock\n\nWe're back to 0 total points (+3 - 3). The opponent continued their ultra-aggressive streak - this is their FIFTH consecutive break attempt! They went with Rock and it worked. Their recent break sequence: Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent successfully predicted our move for the first time in their aggressive phase. Their break pattern shows:\n- Round 13: Rock (lost)\n- Round 14: Scissors (won vs our Rock)\n- Round 15: Paper (lost vs our Rock) \n- Round 16: Scissors (lost vs our Paper)\n- Round 17: Rock (won vs our Paper)\n\nThey're 2-3 in this aggressive phase, but more importantly, they just proved they can still predict us.\n\nStrategic Analyst: This is a crucial moment. The opponent has now shown:\n1. Complete commitment to aggressive breaking (5 consecutive rounds)\n2. They can still successfully predict our moves\n3. They're cycling through moves but with some pattern recognition\n\nThey might be gaining confidence after this successful Rock prediction.\n\nPsychology Expert: After finally succeeding with a break attempt, the opponent might:\n1. Continue the ultra-aggressive pattern with renewed confidence\n2. Stick with Rock since it just worked\n3. Feel emboldened to try more complex predictions\n4. Think they've \"figured us out\"\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their recent cycle was Rock\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Rock. If they continue this pattern, the next move might be Scissors. But they might also repeat Rock since it just succeeded.\n\nStrategic Analyst: We need to be more unpredictable. They just successfully predicted our Paper choice, so they might expect us to either:\n1. Stick with Paper (repeating successful moves)\n2. Switch to Rock (trying to counter their successful Rock)\n3. Finally use Scissors more (our least used move overall)\n\nAI Assistant (me): They're gaining confidence after their successful Rock prediction. If they think they've figured out our pattern, they might try Rock again or expect us to counter with Scissors. Given their recent success, they might try Scissors next (following their cycle pattern). Rock beats Scissors for +3 and gets us back ahead.\n\nPsychology Expert: Success often breeds repetition or continuation of patterns. They might follow their cycle or repeat the successful Rock.\n\nStrategic Analyst: Rock is our best bet to counter their likely Scissors or get maximum points if they try something else.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play Rock\n\n[move] (Opponent gained confidence from successful Rock prediction, likely to continue cycle with Scissors next or repeat successful Rock, Rock beats Scissors for 3 points recovery) rock\n"
