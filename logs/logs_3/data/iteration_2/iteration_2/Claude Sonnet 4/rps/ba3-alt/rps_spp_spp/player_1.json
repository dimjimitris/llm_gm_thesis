    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This isn't standard rock-paper-scissors - the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 vs -1\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 vs -3  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 vs -1\n\nNotice that winning with Rock gives +3 points (the highest reward), while winning with Paper or Scissors only gives +1 point. However, losing to Rock costs -3 points (the highest penalty).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given that this is against a \"fresh player\" (presumably inexperienced), I need to consider their likely behavior. Fresh players often:\n1. Choose Rock first (it's psychologically appealing as \"strong\")\n2. Make random or predictable choices\n3. Don't immediately recognize the asymmetric payoff structure\n\nThe key insight is that Rock has the highest reward (+3) but also creates the highest risk (-3 if opponent plays Paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** For the opening move against an inexperienced player, I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n- If they play Rock (common for beginners), we win +3 points\n- If they play Scissors, we lose only -1 point  \n- If they play Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n\nThe risk-reward ratio favors Paper as an opening move, especially against someone who might default to Rock.\n\n**AI Assistant:** Based on this analysis, Paper seems optimal for the first move - it capitalizes on the likely Rock choice from a fresh player while offering the best risk-reward profile.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to potentially win the high-value +3 points if the fresh player chooses Rock (which beginners often do), while minimizing downside risk.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

This gives us valuable information:\n- They didn't fall into the \"beginner chooses Rock\" pattern\n- They might understand the payoff structure (Paper wins big against Rock)\n- Or they're making random/intuitive choices\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The fact that we both chose Paper suggests a few possibilities:\n1. They're thinking strategically about the +3 payoff from beating Rock\n2. They're copying common strategies they've heard about\n3. It was coincidental\n\nFor round 2, I need to consider: if they're thinking strategically, they might:\n- Stick with Paper (if they think others default to Rock)\n- Switch to Scissors to counter Paper\n- Try Rock to catch Paper players off-guard\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given the tie, there's a psychological tendency for players to either:\n- Repeat the same move (if they think it was \"right\")\n- Switch away from the tied move\n\nSince Paper tied, they might switch to either Rock or Scissors. If they switch to Scissors (to beat Paper), then Rock would be our best response (+1 point). If they switch to Rock, then Paper would win us +3 again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my reasoning for Round 2: Play Rock.\n- If they repeat Paper: We lose -3 (bad outcome)\n- If they switch to Scissors: We win +1 (good outcome)  \n- If they switch to Rock: Tie, 0 points\n\nThe risk is high (-3 if they stick with Paper), but if they're thinking \"Paper tied, maybe try Scissors to counter Paper players,\" then Rock wins.\n\n**AI Assistant:** Actually, let me reconsider. Given the high penalty risk of Rock (-3), and that we don't have strong evidence they'll switch to Scissors, maybe Scissors is safer:\n- Beats Rock (+1) if they switch to Rock\n- Loses to Paper (-1) if they repeat Paper\n- Ties with Scissors (0) if they switch to Scissors\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** I think Scissors is the more balanced choice here - it avoids the -3 penalty risk while still having upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to avoid the high-risk -3 penalty while maintaining winning potential against Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They're sticking with what they think is the \"optimal\" move (countering expected Rock plays)\n2. They're not adapting their strategy yet\n3.

They might:\n- Continue with Paper (if they think it's working)\n- Switch to Rock to counter expected Scissors\n- Switch to Scissors to counter if they think I'll play Paper\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my assessment for Round 3:\n- If they play Paper again: Scissors wins +1\n- If they switch to Rock: Paper wins +3 (best outcome)\n- If they switch to Scissors: Rock wins +1\n\nThe question is: are they likely to stick with Paper or switch?\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given they won last round with Paper and have used it twice, there's a reasonable chance they'll stick with it.

This suggests they ARE adapting their strategy and not just sticking with one move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's sequence (Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors) shows strategic thinking:\n- They may have anticipated I'd play Scissors to counter their Paper pattern\n- They switched to Scissors, which tied with my Scissors\n- This indicates they're reading the game and adjusting\n\nFor Round 4, they know:\n- I played Scissors twice in a row (rounds 2 and 3)\n- They might expect me to continue with Scissors or switch\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** If they think I'm likely to play Scissors again, they might play Rock to beat it (+1 for them).

Let me consider the meta-game:\n- They've shown they can read patterns and adapt\n- They might expect me to either repeat Scissors or switch to Rock/Paper\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's my analysis for Round 4:\n- If I play Rock: Beats Scissors (+1), loses to Paper (-3), ties with Rock (0)\n- If I play Paper: Beats Rock (+3), loses to Scissors (-1), ties with Paper (0)  \n- If I play Scissors: Beats Rock (+1), loses to Paper (-1), ties with Scissors (0)\n\nGiven that they switched from Paper to Scissors last round, they might switch again. If they go back to Paper (thinking I might play Rock to counter their Scissors), then Scissors would win.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Actually, let me think differently.

They seem to have a preference for Paper but occasionally switch to Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This pattern suggests they understand Paper's strategic value (beats Rock for +3) but also shows tactical awareness by switching to Scissors when they anticipated I might counter with Scissors.\n\nNow in Round 5, they know:\n- I've played: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper\n- We've tied 3 out of 4 rounds\n- I seem to be mirroring some of their strategic thinking\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** The key insight is that they returned to Paper in Round 4 after the Scissors experiment.

They switched to Rock in Round 5, which was unexpected given their Paper preference.

Paper beats Scissors, and they've correctly identified that many players (including me) tend to play Scissors frequently. \n\nTheir Paper strategy has resulted in:\n- 3 wins (rounds 2, 6, 8 against my Scissors)\n- 3 ties (rounds 1, 4, 7 - all Paper vs Paper)\n- Only 1 loss (round 5 when they tried Rock)\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 9, I'm facing a player who has found a winning formula. They're likely to play Paper again because:\n1. It's worked 6 times already\n2. I keep playing Scissors (which loses to Paper)\n3. They have no reason to change\n\nBut here's the key insight: if they play Paper again, I need to play Scissors to beat it... wait, no! That's backwards. Paper BEATS Scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think I've been making a fundamental error. Let me recalculate:\n- To beat Paper, I need to play SCISSORS? No, that's wrong.\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper  \n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo to beat their Paper, I need to play... there's no move that beats Paper except... wait, let me reread the rules.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Actually, looking at the rules again:\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nSo Paper beats Scissors. To beat Paper, I would need... but the rules only show what each move beats, not what beats each move. Let me think:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo ROCK beats Paper! That's what I need to counter their Paper strategy.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! If they play Paper (highly likely), then Rock wins me +3 points. This is actually the highest reward possible. The risk is that if they switch to Scissors, I lose -1 point.\n\nGiven their 75% Paper rate, Rock seems like the optimal play despite the risk.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to beat their dominant Paper strategy and potentially win the maximum +3 points.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent's sequence is now:\n- Rounds 1,2,4,6,7,8,9: Paper (7 out of 9 rounds - 78% Paper!)\n- Round 3: Scissors\n- Round 5: Rock\n\nThey played Paper AGAIN in Round 9, confirming their extremely strong pattern. My Rock finally capitalized on this for the big payoff.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is fascinating from a game theory perspective. The opponent has been getting positive results with Paper:\n- 3 wins against my Scissors (+3 total points for them)\n- 3 ties with my Paper (0 points, but no losses)\n- 1 big loss to my Rock (-3 points)\n\nFrom their perspective, Paper has still been profitable overall, but they just took their biggest single loss.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 10, the key question is: will they adapt after losing -3 points, or stick with their winning Paper formula?\n\nPsychological factors to consider:\n- They might be shaken by the big -3 loss\n- They might realize I've finally caught onto their pattern\n- But Paper has been so successful (7/9 rounds) they might stick with it\n- They could switch to Scissors to counter expected Rock\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If I were them, I'd be thinking: \"The AI finally played Rock after I played Paper 7 times. They might expect me to switch away from Paper now, or they might think I'll stick with Paper and play Rock again.\"\n\nThe meta-game is getting complex. They could:\n1. Play Paper again (sticking with what's worked)\n2. Play Scissors (to beat expected Rock repeat)\n3. Play Rock (to tie with expected Rock repeat)\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given that they just lost big, there's a reasonable chance they'll switch to Scissors to counter a potential Rock repeat from me. If they play Scissors, then Paper would beat it and win me +1.\n\nBut there's also still a chance they stick with Paper (it's been their dominant strategy), in which case Rock wins +3 again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think the probabilities are:\n- Paper: 40% (reduced but still possible due to habit)\n- Scissors: 45% (countering expected Rock)\n- Rock: 15% (least likely)\n\nIf they play Scissors (most likely), Paper wins me +1.\nIf they play Paper (still possible), Rock wins me +3.\n\nI think **Paper** is the safer play here with good upside potential.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their likely switch to Scissors while still having reasonable outcomes against their other options.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

The opponent's complete sequence is now:\n- Paper: Rounds 1,2,4,6,7,8,9 (7 times)\n- Scissors: Rounds 3,10 (2 times)\n- Rock: Round 5 (1 time)\n\nThey switched from their dominant Paper strategy to Scissors in Round 10, exactly as we predicted! This confirms they were trying to counter my Rock from Round 9.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a crucial moment in the game. The opponent has now:\n- Lost their biggest advantage (the predictable Paper pattern)\n- Shown they will adapt after taking big losses\n- Demonstrated they're thinking one step ahead (Scissors to counter expected Rock)\n\nThey're becoming more unpredictable, which changes the dynamics significantly.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 11, they know:\n- I successfully countered their Paper dominance with Rock\n- I then predicted their switch to Scissors and beat it with Paper\n- I'm clearly reading their moves and adapting\n\nFrom their perspective, I'm now 2-for-2 in reading their adaptations. This might make them:\n1. Try to be more random/unpredictable\n2. Go back to Paper (their historically successful move)\n3. Try Rock (haven't used it since Round 5)\n4. Stick with Scissors and hope I don't predict it again\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The psychology here is complex. They might think:\n- \"AI beat my Paper with Rock, then beat my Scissors with Paper. What's next?\"\n- They might expect me to play Scissors (continuing the cycle: Rock\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors)\n- Or they might think I'll go back to Rock to beat Paper if they return to their old pattern\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Let me think about this differently. If they're trying to counter what they think I'll play:\n- If they expect Scissors from me: they'd play Rock\n- If they expect Rock from me: they'd play Paper  \n- If they expect Paper from me: they'd play Scissors\n\nGiven that I just played Paper and won, they might expect me to stick with Paper or move to Scissors next.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Actually, I think there's a good chance they'll return to Paper. Here's why:\n- Paper was their most successful strategy historically\n- They tried adapting and lost\n- They might think \"I should stick with what worked\"\n- The -3 loss from Rock was painful, but Paper still has a good overall record\n\nIf they play Paper, then Rock wins me +3 points again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock to potentially capitalize if they return to their historically successful Paper strategy, accepting the risk they might counter with Scissors.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent's sequence is now:\n- Paper: Rounds 1,2,4,6,7,8,9 (7 times)\n- Scissors: Rounds 3,10 (2 times)  \n- Rock: Rounds 5,11 (2 times)\n\nThey played Rock in Round 11, which tied with my Rock. This shows they're trying to mix up their strategy more - they've now used Rock twice after using it only once in the first 9 rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent is clearly adapting and trying to become less predictable. Their Rock choice in Round 11 suggests they might have been thinking:\n- \"AI played Rock in Round 9 and won big\"\n- \"AI might try Rock again to beat my expected Paper\"\n- \"I'll play Rock too to tie or counter their strategy\"\n\nThis shows increasingly sophisticated thinking from them.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 12, they know:\n- We just tied with Rock vs Rock\n- I've now played Rock twice (rounds 9,11) after never playing it before\n- They're probably trying to read my new patterns\n\nThe question is: what will they do next? Their recent moves show more variety:\n- Round 9: Paper (lost to my Rock)\n- Round 10: Scissors (lost to my Paper)  \n- Round 11: Rock (tied with my Rock)\n\nThey've been losing or tying lately, which might make them want to go back to what worked.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think there are three main possibilities:\n1. Return to Paper (their historically most successful move)\n2. Try Scissors (to beat Rock if they think I'll repeat)\n3. Stick with Rock (since it just avoided a loss)\n\nIf they play Paper: Rock wins +3\nIf they play Scissors: Paper wins +1  \nIf they play Rock: Any move ties for 0\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Given their recent losses, there's a psychological pull to return to Paper - it was their \"comfort zone\" and most successful strategy. Even though it lost to Rock twice, it has the best overall track record.\n\nBut there's also a chance they'll play Scissors, thinking I might stick with Rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I'm leaning toward them playing Paper. After losing twice in a row (rounds 9-10) and then tying, they might want to return to their proven strategy. The tie with Rock doesn't give them confidence to repeat Rock.\n\nIf they play Paper, Rock gives me the maximum +3 points again.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Rock again, betting on their likely return to their historically successful Paper strategy after recent poor results.\n\n[move] Rock\n"

The opponent has now:\n- Lost -3 points twice to my Rock (rounds 9,12)\n- Taken a total of -6 points just from these two Rock vs Paper losses\n- But Paper is still their most frequently played move (8/12 rounds = 67%)\n\nFrom their perspective, they must be frustrated. Their best strategy keeps getting countered by my Rock.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 13, they're facing a dilemma:\n- Paper has been their most successful move historically\n- But Paper has now lost badly to Rock twice in the last 4 rounds\n- They know I'm reading their tendency to return to Paper\n- They might finally abandon Paper or become truly unpredictable\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The key insight is that they're in a psychological bind. They might think:\n- \"I can't keep playing Paper - AI will just play Rock again\"\n- \"But Paper is my best move overall\"\n- \"Maybe I should play Scissors to beat Rock\"\n- \"Or Rock to tie with Rock\"\n\nIf they're trying to counter my apparent Rock preference, they'd play Scissors.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Looking at my recent pattern:\n- I've played Rock in rounds 9, 11, and 12\n- That's 3 Rock plays in the last 4 rounds\n- They might expect me to play Rock again\n\nIf they expect Rock and want to beat it, they'd play Scissors.\nIf they play Scissors, then Paper beats it for +1 point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I think there's a high probability they'll play Scissors in Round 13. They can't keep feeding me +3 points with Paper, and Scissors is the logical counter to my Rock pattern.\n\nThe risk is that they might play Rock (to tie) or stubbornly stick with Paper again, but Scissors seems most likely.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Paper seems like the smart play:\n- Beats Scissors (+1) if they counter my Rock pattern\n- Loses to Rock (-3) if they try to tie my Rock pattern  \n- Ties with Paper (0) if they stick with their pattern\n\nGiven the high likelihood of Scissors, Paper is the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Paper to counter their likely switch to Scissors, which they'll probably use to try beating my recent Rock pattern.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

I'm now 3-for-3 in successfully predicting their adaptations after they lost big with Paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is remarkable strategic reading. The opponent is showing clear patterns:\n- When they lose with Paper to Rock, they try Scissors next\n- When they lose with Scissors to Paper, they... what will they do?\n\nLet me track the adaptation cycles:\n- Round 9: Paper (lost to Rock) \u2192 Round 10: Scissors (lost to Paper)\n- Round 12: Paper (lost to Rock) \u2192 Round 13: Scissors (lost to Paper)\n\nThey're repeating the same adaptation pattern!\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** For Round 14, they're in a familiar situation - they just lost with Scissors to Paper. Looking at the previous time this happened:\n- Round 10: Lost with Scissors to Paper\n- Round 11: Played Rock (tied with my Rock)\n\nSo they might play Rock again, following their established pattern.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The pattern suggests:\n1. Play Paper (their default/comfort move)\n2. When Paper loses to Rock \u2192 switch to Scissors\n3. When Scissors loses to Paper \u2192 switch to Rock\n4. Then likely back to Paper (completing the cycle)\n\nIf they play Rock in Round 14, then Paper beats it for +3 points (maximum reward).\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** But I need to consider they might be learning. They've now been through this cycle twice:\n- Paper \u2192 lose to Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 lose to Paper\n- Paper \u2192 lose to Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 lose to Paper\n\nThey might realize I'm reading their pattern and try something different.

Let me recheck:\n- Rock beats Paper (+3 for winner, -3 for loser)\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n- Scissors beats Rock (+1 for winner, -1 for loser)\n\nSo if opponent played Rock and I played Paper, they should win +3 and I should lose -3. But the message says I lost -3 points, which means... actually, that IS correct. Rock beats Paper, so I lost -3 points.\n\nThe opponent's sequence is now:\n- Paper: Rounds 1,2,4,6,7,8,9,12 (8 times)\n- Scissors: Rounds 3,10,13 (3 times)\n- Rock: Rounds 5,11,14 (3 times)\n\nThey played Rock in Round 14, exactly following the pattern we identified! But I made the wrong prediction about what beats what.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I made a critical error. Let me reclarify the rules:\n- Rock beats Paper (Rock wins +3, Paper loses -3)\n- Paper beats Scissors (Paper wins +1, Scissors loses -1)  \n- Scissors beats Rock (Scissors wins +1, Rock loses -1)\n\nSo when they played Rock and I played Paper, they won +3 and I lost -3. My prediction was right about them playing Rock, but wrong about the counter-move.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** To beat Rock, I need to play SCISSORS, not Paper. \n\nThe opponent's pattern is still holding:\n- Paper (default) \u2192 loses to Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 loses to Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 loses to Scissors\n\nWe're at the \"Rock \u2192 loses to Scissors\" part of their cycle.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** For Round 15, if they continue the pattern:\n- They just played Rock (and won +3)\n- Historically, after playing Rock, they tend to go back to Paper\n- Looking at Round 5 (Rock) \u2192 Round 6 (Paper) and Round 11 (Rock) \u2192 Round 12 (Paper)\n\nIf they play Paper in Round 15, then Scissors beats Paper for +1 point.\n\n**Strategic Analyst:** Actually, let me reconsider. They just WON with Rock (+3 points). This breaks their losing pattern. They might be tempted to stick with Rock since it just worked so well.\n\nBut their historical tendency is to return to Paper after Rock, regardless of outcome.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their strong pattern of cycling back to Paper after Rock, and the fact that Paper has been their most frequent move overall (8/14 rounds), I think they'll play Paper in Round 15.\n\nIf they play Paper: Scissors wins +1\nIf they play Rock again: Scissors wins +1  \nIf they play Scissors: Rock wins +1\n\nScissors actually wins against both Paper and Rock, making it a strong choice here.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play Scissors to beat their likely return to Paper, while also covering the possibility they repeat Rock.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"
