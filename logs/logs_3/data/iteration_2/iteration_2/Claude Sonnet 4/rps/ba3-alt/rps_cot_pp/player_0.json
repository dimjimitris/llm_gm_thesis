    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff matrix:\n   - Paper beats scissors: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Rock beats paper: +3 points (opponent gets -3) \n   - Scissors beats rock: +1 points (opponent gets -1)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Identify the highest reward move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3 points) when it beats paper\n   - Paper and scissors only give +1 point when they win\n\n3. Consider opponent behavior:\n   - This is a \"fresh player\" so I have no information about their patterns\n   - Against an unknown opponent, I should consider what move gives me the best expected value\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays paper, I lose 3 points (worst case)\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays scissors, I win 1 point\n   - If I play rock and opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\n   - Rock has high reward potential but also high risk\n\n5. For the first move against an unknown player:\n   - Many players instinctively choose rock first (it's psychologically appealing)\n   - If opponent chooses rock, I should play paper to get the +3 point advantage\n   - This seems like the optimal first move against a fresh player\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to potentially counter a likely rock choice and gain the maximum 3 points.\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review what happened in Round 1:\n   - I played paper, opponent played scissors\n   - Scissors beats paper, so I actually LOST and got -1 points\n   - The hint says I \"won\" and \"scored 1 points\" - this seems incorrect based on the rules\n\n2. Clarify the rules again:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 points)\n   - Rock beats paper (+3 points) \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 points)\n   - Wait - if paper beats scissors, then I did win with +1 points\n\n3. Re-examine the payoff structure:\n   - The hint is correct: I won with paper vs scissors and got +1 point\n   - This means paper beats scissors (not the other way around as I initially thought)\n\n4. Learn about my opponent:\n   - They chose scissors in round 1\n   - This gives me one data point about their behavior\n   - No clear pattern yet with just one move\n\n5. Strategic thinking for Round 2:\n   - Opponent played scissors last round\n   - They might stick with scissors, switch randomly, or have some pattern\n   - If they repeat scissors, I should play paper again (+1 points)\n   - If they switch to rock, I should play scissors (+1 points)  \n   - If they switch to paper, I should play rock (+3 points)\n\n6. Best expected value move:\n   - Rock gives the highest potential reward (+3) if they play paper\n   - Since I have limited information, I'll go for the high-value option\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially get the maximum 3 points if opponent switches to paper.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Confirm the opponent's mechanically perfect cycling pattern:\n   - The pattern remains absolutely flawless: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - 22 rounds of complete adherence to this 3-move cycle\n   - Zero deviation or strategic learning\n\n3. Predict Round 23 move:\n   - Following the established cycle: scissors \u2192 ROCK \u2192 paper\n   - We're at the second position in the eighth cycle\n   - Opponent's next move should be rock\n\n4.

Pattern reliability assessment:\n   - 22 consecutive rounds of identical cyclic behavior\n   - This is statistically impossible to occur by random chance\n   - The opponent is completely locked into this exploitable strategy\n\n7. Expected outcome:\n   - Playing scissors should give me another +1 point\n   - This would bring my total to +36 points\n   - Continue my commanding lead through perfect pattern recognition\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to counter the predicted rock move and extend my perfect winning streak.\n\n[move] scissors\n"
