    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Paper and Scissors have lower risk/reward (+1/-1).\n\nSince I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed a strategy yet, they might choose randomly or go with their first instinct. Many people intuitively choose Rock first in rock-paper-scissors games.\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff when successful, and there's a reasonable chance a new player might choose Rock, I'll play Paper to counter it.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Let me check what actually happened:\n\n- I played Rock\n- Opponent played Scissors\n- Rock beats Scissors (according to the rules)\n- But I'm told I lost and scored -1 points\n\nThis suggests I may have misunderstood the scoring. Let me reread the rules:\n\n\"scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n\nAh! I see the issue now. The rules state that SCISSORS beats ROCK, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors where rock beats scissors. So in this variant:\n- Paper beats Scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats Paper (+3/-3) \n- Scissors beats Rock (+1/-1)\n\nSo my opponent has now played Scissors twice and won both times:\n- Round 1: Their Scissors beat my Paper\n- Round 2: Their Scissors beat my Rock  \n\nThey're clearly favoring Scissors, which beats Rock but loses to Paper. Since they've won twice with Scissors, they might stick with it. I should play Paper to counter their likely Scissors choice.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

Try Paper to counter potential Scissors from me\n\nGiven that Scissors is still their most played move (11 out of 20 times) and has been very successful for them, they might stick with it. But they might also expect me to play Paper again since it just worked.\n\nI think I'll stick with Paper one more time. If they repeat Scissors, I win again. If they switch to Rock, I lose 3 points, but that's a risk I need to take to try to catch up from -17.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They've now played:\n- Scissors: 12 times\n- Rock: 6 times\n- Paper: 4 times\n\nRecent pattern: Rock, Scissors, Scissors - they seem to be sticking with Scissors more frequently again.\n\nI've now beaten their Scissors with Paper twice in a row. They might:\n1. Finally switch away from Scissors to counter my Paper strategy\n2. Continue with Scissors (their clear favorite and most successful move)\n3. Play Rock for the big +3 to counter my likely Paper\n\nThis is a critical decision. Paper has worked twice in a row, but they might finally adapt. However, Scissors is still their overwhelmingly preferred move (12 out of 21 times), so there's a good chance they'll stick with it.\n\nI'm going to go for the hat trick and play Paper again. If they stick with Scissors, I'll win a third straight time. The risk is they switch to Rock for -3, but I need to capitalize on this winning streak.\n\n[move] Paper\n"
