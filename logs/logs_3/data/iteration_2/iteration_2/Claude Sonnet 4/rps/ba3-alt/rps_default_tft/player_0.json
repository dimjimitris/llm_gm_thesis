    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me look at the payoff matrix:\n\n- Paper beats Scissors: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n- Rock beats Paper: +3 for me, -3 for opponent  \n- Scissors beats Rock: +1 for me, -1 for opponent\n\nThe key insight is that Rock gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins, but also the highest penalty (-3) when it loses. Since I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" who likely hasn't developed any patterns yet, they might choose randomly or go with common beginner tendencies.\n\nMany beginners tend to start with Rock (it's often the first choice people think of), so playing Paper could be a good counter-strategy to potentially win 3 points right away.\n\n[move] Paper\n"

They might:\n1. Stick with Paper if they think it's a good strategy\n2. Switch to Rock to counter Paper \n3. Try Scissors for variety\n\nGiven that Rock has the highest payoff (+3/-3), and my opponent showed they're thinking strategically by also choosing Paper initially, I'll anticipate they might try Rock this round to counter a potential repeat of Paper.\n\nTherefore, I'll play Scissors to counter their potential Rock play, which would give me +1 point.\n\n[move] Scissors\n"

They might now expect me to continue with Scissors since it just won, or they might think I'll switch strategies.\n\nGiven that they played Rock last round and lost, they might avoid Rock this time. They could go with:\n1. Paper to counter Scissors (expecting me to repeat)\n2. Scissors to match what worked for me\n3. Back to Rock if they think I'll switch away from Scissors\n\nSince Paper beats Scissors and would be a logical counter to my winning move, I'll anticipate they might play Paper.
