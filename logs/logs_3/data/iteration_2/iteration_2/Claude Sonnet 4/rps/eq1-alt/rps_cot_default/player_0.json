Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me re-read the original rules: \"rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points\"\n4. Ah! I misunderstood - the rules state that ROCK beats PAPER, not the traditional rock-paper-scissors rules I was thinking of.\n5. So the correct rules are:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n6. Now for this round: My opponent just played rock in the first round. Fresh players might:\n   - Stick with what worked (rock again)\n   - Try something different\n   - Still be somewhat random\n7. If they play rock again, I should play scissors (since scissors beats rock).\n8. If they switch to paper, I should play rock.\n9. If they switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n10.

I need to analyze what a fresh player might do after losing:\n   - They might stick with rock since it worked once before\n   - They might switch strategies after the loss\n   - Fresh players often don't have complex patterns yet\n4.

My best responses would be:\n   - If they play rock: I should play scissors (wins)\n   - If they play paper: I should play rock (wins) \n   - If they play scissors: I should play paper (wins)\n6. Since my opponent has shown a tendency toward rock (2 out of 2 rounds), and fresh players often stick with familiar choices, rock seems most likely again.\n7. However, they just lost with rock, so they might be more likely to switch this time.\n8. Given the uncertainty, I should consider what gives me the best expected outcome.

I had one win when I chose \"arbitrarily\" (paper), but now we're tied again\n5. Looking at this more carefully - maybe the key insight is that when I try to be strategic and predict their moves, we tie. When I acted randomly, I won.\n6. This suggests my opponent might indeed be using similar logical reasoning to mine\n7. When I think \"they'll probably play rock so I'll play scissors,\" they might be thinking the same way and also end up playing scissors\n8. The successful round was when I deliberately avoided strategic thinking\n9. Let me try this approach again - instead of trying to predict what they'll do, let me pick something that feels random or counter to my strategic instincts\n10. My strategic instinct right now says \"play paper to beat rock\" (since rock is their most common)\n11. So I'll deliberately NOT do that, and instead play rock - not because it's strategic, but because it's different from what my analysis suggests\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock, deliberately going against my strategic reasoning to see if random/anti-analytical choices continue to work better.\n\n[move] rock\n"

Key insight: Whether I use strategic reasoning OR deliberately anti-strategic reasoning, I keep tying\n7. This suggests my opponent is somehow mirroring my decision-making process itself, not just my moves\n8. Maybe I need to truly not think about this at all - just pick the first thing that comes to mind without any reasoning\n9.
