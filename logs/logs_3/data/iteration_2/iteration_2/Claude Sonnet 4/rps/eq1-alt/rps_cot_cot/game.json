Consider my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be inexperienced or unpredictable\n   - I have no information about their previous moves or patterns\n\n3. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Since I have no information about my opponent's tendencies, each move has equal probability of winning, losing, or tying\n   - In a truly random scenario, all moves are equally valid\n   - However, many inexperienced players tend to choose rock first (it's often the most intuitive choice)\n\n4. Make my decision:\n   - If my opponent is likely to choose rock (common first choice for new players), I should choose paper to beat it\n   - This gives me the best chance of winning the first round\n\n[move] paper\n"

Consider anti-synchronization strategy:\n   - I need to think about what my natural strategic instinct would be, then choose differently\n   - My instinct after a rock tie might be to choose scissors (to complete the cycle)\n   - But if they're thinking the same way, that leads to another tie\n   - I should choose what beats their expected next move in their cycle\n\n6.

Consider opponent psychology at this critical point:\n   - Five straight losses should be devastating\n   - They MUST realize something is wrong with their strategy\n   - However, they might be so locked into the pattern they can't break it\n   - Or they might finally make a desperate change\n\n6. Assess the risk/reward:\n   - My +7 lead is extremely comfortable\n   - Even if they break the pattern and beat me, I'm still far ahead\n   - But if they continue the cycle, I could achieve a sixth consecutive win\n   - The psychological pressure on them is immense\n\n7. Strategic decision:\n   - If they choose paper (continuing cycle), I should choose rock\n   - If they finally break the pattern, they might choose scissors or rock\n   - Given their incredible consistency despite 5 losses, they might continue\n   - I should trust the pattern that has given me 5 straight wins\n\n[move] Rock\n"

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
