    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the game mechanics:\n   - Paper beats scissors (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Rock beats paper (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)  \n   - Scissors beats rock (+1 for me, -1 for opponent)\n   - Ties give 0 points to both players\n\n2. Consider what I know about my opponent:\n   - They are described as a \"fresh player\"\n   - This suggests they might be new or inexperienced\n   - I have no previous game history with them\n\n3. Think about optimal strategy:\n   - In pure game theory, rock-paper-scissors should be played randomly with equal probability for each move\n   - However, humans often have patterns and biases\n   - New players often favor rock as their first move (it's psychologically seen as \"strong\")\n   - Some players also favor scissors as it feels \"aggressive\"\n\n4. Make my strategic decision:\n   - Since this is against a fresh player, I'll exploit the common tendency for new players to choose rock\n   - If they choose rock, I should choose paper to win\n   - This gives me the best chance of gaining +1 point in the first round\n\n[move] paper\n"

Correct understanding of the rules:\n   - Paper beats scissors\n   - Rock beats paper  \n   - Scissors beats rock\n   - This is the standard rock-paper-scissors rules\n\n3. Analyze my opponent's behavior:\n   - They chose rock in the first round\n   - This confirms the tendency for new players to choose rock\n   - But now they know I chose paper, so they might adjust their strategy\n\n4. Strategic considerations for round 2:\n   - If they stick with rock again, I should choose scissors to beat rock\n   - If they think I'll choose paper again (since I lost), they might switch to scissors to beat paper\n   - If they switch to paper (thinking I'll choose rock to beat their previous rock), I should choose scissors\n\n5. Make my decision:\n   - Given they're a fresh player who chose rock first, they might either stick with rock or switch to scissors\n   - Scissors beats rock and also beats their potential switch to scissors would tie\n   - I'll go with scissors to counter their likely rock choice\n\n[move] scissors\n"

Strategic validation:\n   - My Paper strategy directly exploits their strongest bias\n   - Even when they occasionally adapt with Rock, they return to Scissors\n   - The 55% Scissors rate gives Paper a strong mathematical advantage\n\n5. Risk assessment:\n   - Playing Paper: 55% chance to win vs Scissors, 30% chance to lose vs Rock, 10% chance to tie vs Paper\n   - Expected value: (0.55 \u00d7 1) + (0.30 \u00d7 -1) + (0.10 \u00d7 0) = +0.25 points per round\n   - This is clearly positive expected value\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Continue with Paper to maintain the statistical advantage\n   - Consistency in exploiting their weakness is key to long-term success\n\n[move] paper\n"

            "text": "Outstanding! My frequency-based strategy is consistently successful. Let me continue with this approach.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Review current situation:\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 Paper beats scissors (I won +1)\n   - Current total: -1 points (almost back to even!)\n   - Three wins with Paper vs Scissors in recent rounds\n\n2. Update opponent's move frequency:\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 4, 5, 11, 14, 17 (6 times)\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21 (12 times)\n   - Paper: rounds 3, 9 (2 times)\n   - Total: 21 rounds\n   - Scissors: 12/21 = 57%\n   - Rock: 6/21 = 29%\n   - Paper: 2/21 = 10%\n\n3. Key insights:\n   - Their Scissors preference is actually increasing (now 57%)\n   - This is a very strong and consistent bias\n   - My Paper strategy has a 57% win rate based on their patterns\n\n4. Mathematical advantage:\n   - Expected value per round: (0.57 \u00d7 1) + (0.29 \u00d7 -1) + (0.10 \u00d7 0) = +0.28 points\n   - This is excellent expected value for this type of game\n   - Consistency is key to realizing this mathematical edge\n\n5. Strategic assessment:\n   - I've identified and am successfully exploiting their main weakness\n   - Even when they occasionally play Rock to counter, they return to Scissors\n   - This appears to be their natural tendency as a \"fresh player\"\n\n6. Decision:\n   - Continue with Paper to maintain the statistical advantage\n   - With nearly 60% Scissors usage, this remains the optimal strategy\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review current situation:\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 Rock beats paper (I lost -1)\n   - Current total: -2 points (back down)\n   - They adapted with Rock after I won several rounds with Paper\n\n2. Look at the adaptation pattern more carefully:\n   - Rounds 18, 20, 21: I won with Paper vs Scissors (3 wins in recent rounds)\n   - Round 22: They played Rock (countering my Paper strategy)\n   - This suggests they do adapt when I get too successful with one move\n\n3. Update frequency:\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 4, 5, 11, 14, 17, 22 (7 times)\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21 (12 times)\n   - Paper: rounds 3, 9 (2 times)\n   - Total: 22 rounds\n   - Scissors: 12/22 = 55%\n   - Rock: 7/22 = 32%\n   - Paper: 2/22 = 9%\n\n4. Strategic insight:\n   - They still heavily favor Scissors (55%) as their base preference\n   - But they do tactically adapt with Rock when I win too much with Paper\n   - I need to account for both their bias AND their adaptation\n\n5. Tactical decision:\n   - They just played Rock (likely tactical adaptation)\n   - They'll probably return to their Scissors preference next round\n   - If they return to Scissors: Paper beats Scissors\n   - If they stick with Rock: Scissors beats Rock\n   - Given their strong Scissors bias, I'll bet they return to Scissors\n\n6. Make my move:\n   - Back to Paper, expecting them to return to their preferred Scissors\n\n[move] paper\n"

Review current situation:\n   - Round 23: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 Rock beats paper (I lost -1)\n   - Current total: -3 points\n   - They played Rock twice in a row (rounds 22, 23)\n\n2. Analyze recent pattern:\n   - Round 21: Paper vs Scissors (I won)\n   - Round 22: Paper vs Rock (I lost) \n   - Round 23: Paper vs Rock (I lost)\n   - They seem to be sticking with Rock longer than before\n\n3. Update frequency:\n   - Rock: rounds 1, 4, 5, 11, 14, 17, 22, 23 (8 times)\n   - Scissors: rounds 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21 (12 times)\n   - Paper: rounds 3, 9 (2 times)\n   - Total: 23 rounds\n   - Scissors: 12/23 = 52%\n   - Rock: 8/23 = 35%\n   - Paper: 2/23 = 9%\n\n4.
