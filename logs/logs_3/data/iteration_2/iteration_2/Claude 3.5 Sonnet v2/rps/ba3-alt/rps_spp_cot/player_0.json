    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

However, in first-time games, players often tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's considered a \"strong\" opening move psychologically.\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest playing Paper for the first move. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays Rock (which is common), we get 3 points\n2. If opponent plays Paper, it's a tie (0 points)\n3. If opponent plays Scissors, we lose only 1 point\nThe risk-reward ratio is favorable here.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

They are using similar strategic thinking to us\n2. They might anticipate we'll stick with paper and try to counter it\n3. The tie means neither player gained advantage\n\nStatistical Analyst: With the opponent showing strategic thinking (choosing paper first), we should consider that they might:\n1. Switch to scissors to beat our paper if we maintain it\n2. Maintain paper expecting us to switch\n3. Switch to rock thinking we'll switch to scissors\n\nDecision Strategist: Given this, we have two strong options:\n1. Switch to rock - This protects against scissors if they try to counter our previous paper, and gives us 3 points if they stick with paper\n2. Maintain paper - This could work if they overthink and switch to rock\n\nGame Theorist: I suggest switching to rock. Here's why:\n- If they switch to scissors (trying to beat our paper), we win 1 point\n- If they maintain paper (expecting us to switch to scissors), we win 3 points\n- If they switch to rock themselves, it's a tie\nThe worst case is a tie, and we have two winning scenarios.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Agreed.

They might be mirroring our moves to study our strategy\n2. Could be getting more conservative after recent losses\n3. Might be setting up for another strategic shift\n\nGame Theorist: After a Paper tie, they might:\n1. Switch to Scissors as the conventional counter\n2. Maintain Paper expecting us to switch\n3. Switch to Rock as an unexpected move\n\nDecision Strategist: Current situation assessment:\n1. We've maintained our positive position\n2. Our winning streak was broken but not with a loss\n3. Opponent has shown they can predict our more obvious moves\n\nStatistical Analyst: Looking at their behavior after ties:\n1. They often make unexpected moves\n2. They've successfully baited us with apparent patterns\n3. They seem to read our strategic thinking well\n\nDecision Strategist: I recommend Rock. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to Scissors (conventional counter to Paper), we win 1 point\n2. If they maintain Paper, we lose 3 points\n3. If they play Rock, it's a tie\n4. At +1 points, we should play somewhat conservatively\n5. They might expect us to play Scissors as an obvious counter to the Paper tie\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Rock provides:\n1. Protection against the most likely counter (Scissors)\n2. A balanced risk-reward profile\n3. A less predictable play than Scissors\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Playing a balanced counter that protects our positive position while avoiding obvious moves.\n"

Switch to Paper as the conventional counter\n2. Maintain Rock for a third time\n3. Switch to Scissors as an unexpected move\n\nStatistical Analyst: The high frequency of recent ties suggests:\n1. Both sides are playing more predictably\n2. The opponent might be waiting for us to make a risky move\n3. They might be setting up for a pattern break\n\nDecision Strategist: I recommend Scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they switch to Paper (conventional counter to Rock), we win 1 point\n2. If they maintain Rock, we lose only 1 point\n3. If they play Scissors, it's a tie\n4. With +1 points and recent ties, we should make a measured aggressive move\n5. They might expect us to play Paper as an obvious counter to the Rock tie\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Scissors provides:\n1. Potential to catch them if they make the obvious Paper counter\n2. Limited downside risk (-1 rather than -3)\n3. A less predictable play than Paper\n4.

Try to predict our pattern-breaking move\n\nStatistical Analyst: Three consecutive ties is a strong pattern that:\n1. Cannot be coincidental\n2. Shows they have good read on our strategy\n3. Suggests they're waiting for us to make a mistake\n\nDecision Strategist: I recommend Paper. Here's why:\n1. If they maintain their mirroring strategy with Paper, it's another tie\n2. If they try to counter our expected Rock (counter to Scissors) with Paper, we tie\n3. If they play Rock thinking we'll play Scissors again, we win 3 points\n4. If they play Scissors expecting us to play Paper, we lose only 1 point\n5. Breaking the recent pattern with Paper rather than the more obvious Rock\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed.
