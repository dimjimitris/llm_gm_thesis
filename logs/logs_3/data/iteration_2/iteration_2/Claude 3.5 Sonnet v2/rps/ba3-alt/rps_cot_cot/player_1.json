    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Psychological state:\n   * Multiple ties suggest similar strategic thinking\n   * Both players likely frustrated with ties\n   * Need to break this mirroring pattern\n   * They might be anticipating my next move\n\n4. Game theory consideration:\n   * After scissors tie, conventional play is rock\n   * But they've proven to think unconventionally\n   * They've successfully predicted pattern breaks\n   * They might expect me to avoid obvious moves\n\n5. Their potential strategies:\n   * Might play rock to beat repeated scissors\n   * Could play paper expecting my rock\n   * Might stick with scissors expecting mind games\n   * Could be trying to bait a specific move\n\n6. Risk assessment:\n   * Rock: Safe against scissors but vulnerable to paper (-3)\n   * Paper: High reward vs rock (+3) but vulnerable to scissors (-1)\n   * Scissors: Has led to ties but becoming predictable\n\n7. Strategic reasoning:\n   * Need to break tie cycle\n   * They've matched my last two moves exactly\n   * They might expect me to switch to rock\n   * Paper would beat expected rock\n\n8. Decision logic:\n   * Rock is too obvious after scissors tie\n   * They likely expect a pattern break\n   * Paper offers highest reward potential\n   * Even if they use scissors, loss is minimal (-1)\n   * Need to take calculated risk to break tie cycle\n\nFinish steps!\n\n[move] Paper - Taking calculated risk to break tie pattern, betting they'll use rock to counter scissors, accepting minimal risk if wrong\n"
