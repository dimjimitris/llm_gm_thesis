    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper has balanced outcomes: win +1 / lose -3. Scissors has the most moderate outcomes: win +1 / lose -1.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is a fresh game against a new player, we don't have historical data to work with. We should focus on the mathematical expectation of each move.\n\nGame Strategist: Looking at the first move psychology, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's considered \"strong\". We could counter that with Paper.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with Paper as the first move. If we win, we get +1. If we lose, -3 is manageable. If opponent chooses Rock (common first move), we win. If it's a tie, no loss.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Paper seems like a solid first move.

They might anticipate us changing to Rock (to beat their previous Scissors), and thus switch to Paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze the opponent's first move - they chose Scissors, which is actually the least common opening move. This suggests they might be a more strategic player rather than a conventional one.\n\nGame Strategist: Given that they showed strategic thinking in round 1, they're likely to anticipate our most obvious counter (Rock). Therefore, they might switch to Paper to counter our Rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I agree. The opponent seems to think ahead. Playing Rock would be too obvious a counter-move.\n\nRisk Analyst: If we predict they'll play Paper, we should use Scissors. The risk-reward ratio for Scissors is the most balanced (win +1 / lose -1), and if we're right about their Paper play, we'll win.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. Scissors is the optimal move here. If they stick with their previous Scissors move, it's a tie (0 points). If they switch to Paper as we predict, we win (+1). If they try to counter our expected Rock with Paper, we also win (+1).

They might have expected us to play Rock in Round 2 (to counter their Round 1 Scissors), which would explain their Rock play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Given the opponent's adaptability and that they've played Scissors and Rock, there's a high probability they might choose Paper this round for two reasons:\n1. They haven't played Paper yet\n2. Paper would have beaten their previous move (Rock)\n\nPattern Analyzer: But they might also be thinking multiple levels ahead. If they think we'll expect Paper, they might stick with Rock to beat our anticipated Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: In this mind game, going with Paper gives us the best expected value:\n- If they play Rock (trying to beat our expected Scissors): We win (+1)\n- If they play Paper (completing their sequence): We tie (0)\n- If they play Scissors (trying to be unpredictable): We lose (-1)\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree with Paper.

The tie in Round 3 confirms they're a strategic player. They've demonstrated they can think several moves ahead and adapt to predicted counters.\n\nRisk Analyst: It's interesting that their sequence has moved from offensive (Scissors) to defensive (Rock) to balanced (Paper). This could suggest a cyclical strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: After a tie with Paper, many players would be tempted to change their move. Given their strategic nature, they might expect us to play Scissors to beat their potential Paper repeat.\n\nPattern Analyzer: If they think we'll play Scissors, they might choose Rock. However, they've also shown they don't like being predictable. They haven't repeated any move yet.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's evaluate Rock as our move:\n- If they play Paper (continuing unpredictability): We win (+3)\n- If they play Rock (trying to counter our expected Scissors): We tie (0)\n- If they play Scissors (maximum counter-strategy): We lose (-1)\nThe potential gain (+3) outweighs the potential loss (-1).\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed.

So they should play Paper to beat our Rock\n\nRisk Analyst: However, this opponent has shown that when we think too many levels deep, they beat us. When we made more straightforward plays, we've done better.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior after losses, they tend to make decisive moves rather than defensive ones. After these two losses, they're likely to make an aggressive play trying to regain momentum.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. They're most likely to play Scissors here - it's aggressive, can win points, and would counter our potential Paper play (if we were trying to beat their previous Paper move).\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be our best counter:\n- Beats Scissors (their likely aggressive play) for +3\n- Loses to Paper (less likely after they just lost with it) for -3\n- Ties with Rock (unlikely as they rarely play defensively after losses) for 0\n\nPattern Analyzer: This feels like the right read. They've shown a tendency to be aggressive after losses, and Scissors would be their most logical aggressive play here.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Anticipating an aggressive recovery play from opponent after their consecutive losses, while maintaining our more straightforward strategic approach.\n"

More importantly, they've now used Scissors four times - more than any other move - and just successfully broke their losing streak with it.\n\nGame Strategist: Interesting that they used Scissors when we predicted Scissors. They're demonstrating they can win even when we correctly predict their move - by predicting our prediction of their prediction.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Critical observations:\n1. They've shown a preference for Scissors (4 times vs 3 Rock, 3 Paper)\n2. They just succeeded with Scissors after two losses\n3. They've demonstrated they can use our own logical predictions against us\n\nRisk Analyst: They've won multiple times by playing what we thought they would play, knowing we would overthink and choose the wrong counter. This suggests they're extremely skilled at meta-game thinking.\n\nGame Strategist: After a win with Scissors, conventional thinking suggests:\n1. They might stick with their winning move\n2. Or they might expect us to play Rock to counter potential Scissors repeat\n3. So they might play Paper to beat our Rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: But they've consistently shown they can out-think our logical chains. Perhaps we should focus on the fundamental fact that they've shown a clear preference for Scissors throughout the game.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Looking at their overall pattern, Scissors is their most-used and most comfortable move. After breaking their losing streak with it, they might simply stick with what works.\n\nGame Strategist: Then let's not overthink this. If they've shown a preference for Scissors, and just won with it, there's a good chance they'll use it again. Rock is our best play:\n- Beats their preferred Scissors move (+3)\n- Loses to Paper (-3)\n- Ties with Rock (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Sometimes the simplest read is the best one.

Their last four moves: Scissors\u2192Paper\u2192Scissors\u2192Paper\n3. They've been alternating between Scissors and Paper recently\n\nGame Strategist: The alternating pattern between Scissors and Paper in their recent moves is interesting, but could be a trap. This opponent has shown they're excellent at setting up patterns only to break them at crucial moments.\n\nRisk Analyst: If they continue the alternation, they would play Scissors next. However, given their sophisticated play style, they might expect us to spot this pattern and counter it with Rock.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their recent losses might push them toward one of two extremes:\n1. Return to Rock (their most successful move earlier in the game)\n2. Try to establish a new pattern to confuse us\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated level of thinking and recent losses, they're most likely to go with option 1 - return to Rock. It's their most reliable move that gave them their biggest wins earlier.\n\nRisk Analyst: I agree. Paper would be our best move here:\n- Beats Rock (their likely return to stability) (+1)\n- Loses to Scissors (if they continue alternating) (-1)\n- Ties with Paper (least likely given recent losses) (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The moderate risk-reward profile of Paper also protects us from losing too much if we're wrong, while giving us a chance to win if they do return to Rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper Anticipating opponent's likely return to Rock as a stabilizing move after recent losses, while maintaining reasonable risk exposure.\n"

After this tie, it's crucial to note that ties have often been turning points in this game where the opponent shows unexpected adaptations.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at what happened after previous ties:\n- Paper tie (Round 3) \u2192 They played Rock\n- Rock tie (Round 4) \u2192 They played Paper\n- Scissors tie (Round 7) \u2192 They played Scissors\nNo consistent pattern after ties.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Recent patterns:\n1. They've used Paper twice in a row (first time in the game for any move)\n2. Their last 5 moves show increasing Paper frequency\n3. After their previous double-move (Scissors-Scissors), they switched to Paper\n\nGame Strategist: This opponent has consistently demonstrated they can think multiple levels ahead. After showing their first double-move with Paper, they might expect us to:\n1. Play Scissors to beat a third Paper\n2. Therefore, they should play Rock to beat our Scissors\n3. So we should play Paper to beat their Rock\n\nRisk Analyst: However, when we've tried to out-think them at multiple levels, we've often lost. Our recent successes came from more straightforward plays.\n\nPattern Analyzer: I suggest focusing on their immediate situation: They've just played Paper twice (unusual for them), and historically they prefer to switch strategies after revealing any clear pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: Agreed. They're most likely to break their Paper pattern, and given their strategic sophistication, they'll expect us to play Scissors against a third Paper. This makes Rock their most logical play.\n\nRisk Analyst: Paper would be risky here as they've just played it twice. Scissors would be moderate but predictable.

Looking at their behavior throughout the game, they tend to revert to Scissors when other strategies fail. It's been their most consistent move and offers them a chance to shift momentum without risking a big loss.\n\nGame Strategist: Their sophisticated play style suggests they might try to out-think us here, but given their recent losses, they're more likely to revert to their comfort zone with Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be our optimal play:\n- Beats their likely Scissors play (+3)\n- Loses to Paper (unlikely after just failing with it) (-3)\n- Ties with Rock (possible but less likely) (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: The high-risk/high-reward nature of Rock matches well here. They're likely to make an aggressive play to try to recover, and Scissors has been their preferred aggressive move.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock Expecting opponent to return to their preferred Scissors play under pressure, while accepting the calculated risk of this aggressive counter.\n"

They just broke their losing streak with Scissors, which is now their most used move (7 times vs 6 Paper, 5 Rock).\n\nRisk Analyst: After successfully using Scissors to break their losing streak, they have two likely approaches:\n1. Stick with what just worked (Scissors again)\n2. Anticipate our adaptation to their successful move\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key observations:\n1. Scissors just worked for them\n2. They rarely repeat moves after breaking losing streaks\n3. They excel at predicting our adaptations to their successful moves\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial moment. They've shown throughout the game that they can identify when we're making obvious counters to their moves. They'll expect us to play Rock to counter their successful Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their likely thought process:\n- Scissors just succeeded\n- We'll probably play Rock to counter Scissors\n- Paper would beat our expected Rock\n- But that's too obvious given their sophisticated play style\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their behavior after breaking losing streaks:\n1. They tend to switch moves\n2. They often make unexpected choices\n3. They've shown they can outthink our multi-level predictions\n\nGame Strategist: I propose we avoid overthinking here. Their Scissors play just worked, and under pressure (still trailing in points), players often stick with what's working rather than make complex strategic shifts.\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be too obvious a counter. Paper would be overthinking. Scissors offers:\n- Ties with their potential Scissors repeat (0)\n- Wins against Paper (if they try to counter our expected Rock) (+1)\n- Loses to Rock (if they make an unexpected switch) (-1)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Scissors gives us the most balanced risk-reward profile while avoiding the trap of trying to out-predict this sophisticated opponent.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors Taking a balanced approach that covers multiple scenarios while avoiding excessive strategic complexity against this skilled opponent.\n"

Rock is now tied with Scissors as their most used move (7 times each, vs 6 Paper)\n2. They've lost two of their last three moves\n3. Their moves are becoming more erratic under pressure\n\nGame Strategist: When this opponent has been under pressure before, they've often made unexpected moves rather than following logical patterns. However, they're now showing signs of tilting with less strategic coherence.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's analyze their state:\n- Down by 6 points\n- Recent strategies failing\n- Might feel pressure to make a big scoring move\n- Rock just failed twice recently\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their recent behavior suggests they're moving away from their earlier sophisticated play style toward more reactive moves. Under this kind of pressure, players often:\n1. Make aggressive moves hoping for big scores\n2. Become more predictable due to stress\n3. Over-correct from failed moves\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, Paper seems their most likely play:\n- Haven't used it recently\n- Could win big (+3) against Rock\n- Represents a complete change from their recent failed moves\n\nRisk Analyst: Scissors would be our best counter:\n- Beats their likely Paper play (+1)\n- Loses to Rock (less likely given recent failures) (-1)\n- Ties with Scissors (unlikely as they're showing more erratic patterns) (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. When players start showing signs of tilt, they often revert to more basic strategies.

After ties, this opponent has often shown unexpected adaptations.\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at their behavior after previous ties:\n- Paper tie (R3) \u2192 They played Rock\n- Rock tie (R4) \u2192 They played Paper\n- Scissors tie (R7) \u2192 They played Scissors\n- Paper tie (R12) \u2192 They played Paper\nNo consistent pattern after ties.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key observations:\n1. Scissors is now clearly their most frequent move\n2. They're still trailing significantly in points\n3. Their recent moves show less strategic sophistication than earlier\n\nGame Strategist: Under pressure and after a tie, they have two likely approaches:\n1. Switch completely to try to surprise us (as they did earlier in the game)\n2. Stick with Scissors, hoping we overthink their strategy\n\nRisk Analyst: Given their current state:\n- Down by 6 points\n- Need significant points to catch up\n- Showing signs of stress in recent moves\nThey might go for Rock to try for a big score (+3).\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, their recent play pattern suggests they're moving away from complex strategy toward more basic, reactive moves. When players are tilting, they often:\n1. Stick with familiar moves\n2. Become more predictable\n3. Focus less on mind games\n\nGame Strategist: Given these factors, they're more likely to stick with Scissors:\n- It's their most used and familiar move\n- They're showing less strategic variation\n- They might hope we overthink and play Paper\n\nRisk Analyst: Rock would be our best counter:\n- Beats their likely Scissors play (+3)\n- Loses to Paper (less likely given recent patterns) (-3)\n- Ties with Rock (possible but less probable) (0)\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed.

They're now down by 9 points and may feel desperate.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Critical patterns:\n1. Paper now matches Scissors as their most used move (8 times each, vs 7 Rock)\n2.

Make aggressive moves hoping for big gains\n2. Become more predictable due to stress\n3. Revert to moves that gave them earlier success\n\nRisk Analyst: Looking at their successful moves in the game, Scissors has given them their most consistent wins. Under extreme pressure, players often return to what worked before.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Agreed. Their sophisticated early-game strategy has largely disappeared. When players are tilting and desperate:\n1. They tend to revert to aggressive moves\n2. They focus less on mind games\n3.

Scissors is now clearly their most used move (9 times vs 8 Paper, 7 Rock)\n2. They just broke their losing streak with it\n3. It's been their most reliable move throughout\n\nGame Strategist: However, this opponent has shown throughout the game that they can anticipate our obvious counters. They might expect us to play Rock against their successful Scissors.\n\nRisk Analyst: Let's consider their perspective:\n- They just succeeded with Scissors\n- They know we'll expect another Scissors\n- They know we'll likely play Rock to counter\n- Paper would beat our expected Rock\n\nPattern Analyzer: But given their recent struggles and finally finding success, they're more likely to stick with what worked. Players tend to be less strategic and more reactive when they finally find a working move after a losing streak.\n\nGame Strategist: I disagree. This opponent has consistently shown they can think ahead, even under pressure.
