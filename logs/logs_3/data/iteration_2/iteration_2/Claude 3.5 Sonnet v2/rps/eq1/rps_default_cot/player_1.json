    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Let me analyze the basic game structure:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - Each win gives +1 point\n   - Each loss gives -1 point\n   - Ties give 0 points\n\n3. Without any prior information, all moves are equally viable:\n   - If they play rock, paper would be best\n   - If they play paper, scissors would be best\n   - If they play scissors, rock would be best\n\n4. In this situation, a common starting strategy is to play rock:\n   - Rock is often played as an opening move by many players\n   - Rock is psychologically perceived as \"strong\" and \"stable\"\n   - If opponent plays scissors, I win\n   - If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (not bad for first round)\n   - Only lose if opponent plays paper\n\n5. Decision: I will play rock for this opening move to test the waters and observe the opponent's initial strategy.\n\n[move] rock I'm choosing rock as an opening move since it's a balanced option that can help me gauge my opponent's strategy.\n"

Analyzing last round:\n   - Opponent played rock\n   - We both got 0 points from the tie\n   - This confirms the common opening move theory\n\n2. Considering opponent psychology:\n   - After a tie with rock, many players either:\n     a) Stick with rock, believing in its strength\n     b) Switch to paper, expecting their opponent to play rock again\n   - Fewer players switch to scissors after a rock tie\n\n3. Strategic options:\n   - If I play rock again: ties if they stick to rock, loses to paper\n   - If I play paper: beats rock, ties with paper, loses to scissors\n   - If I play scissors: beats paper, loses to rock, ties with scissors\n\n4. Reasoning about opponent's likely move:\n   - Given the tie, they might expect me to play rock again\n   - They might switch to paper to counter expected rock\n   - Paper would be a common psychological choice after a rock tie\n\n5. Decision: I will play scissors\n   - This will beat paper if they make the predicted switch\n   - If they stick with rock, I can accept the loss as valuable information\n   - This move helps break out of a potential rock-rock cycle\n\n[move] scissors Based on the previous tie with rock, I'm anticipating a possible switch to paper by my opponent.\n"

Analyzing the pattern so far:\n   - Round 1: rock vs rock (tie)\n   - Round 2: scissors vs scissors (tie)\n   - Opponent has mirrored my moves exactly\n\n2. What this tells me:\n   - Either opponent is deliberately matching my moves\n   - Or we're coincidentally making the same logical choices\n   - Two ties suggest we might be using similar strategic thinking\n\n3. Pattern analysis:\n   - From rock \u2192 scissors shows we both thought similarly about the second move\n   - The natural progression in RPS often goes:\n     rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock (cyclical)\n\n4.

Recent game history:\n   - Round 19: rock vs paper (loss)\n   - Round 20: scissors vs rock (loss)\n   - Round 21: rock vs paper (loss)\n   - Round 22: paper vs rock (win)\n   - Total score: -1 point\n\n2. Critical breakthrough:\n   - Finally broke the 4-game losing streak\n   - Returned to fundamentals worked\n   - Opponent's prediction pattern broken\n   - Score improved from -2 to -1\n\n3. Psychological analysis:\n   - Momentum shift potential\n   - Opponent's first loss after 4 wins\n   - They might be adjusting their strategy\n   - Need to capitalize without overconfidence\n\n4. Opponent tendencies:\n   - Strong at predicting pattern breaks\n   - Adapts well after losses\n   - Previously used losses to start new strategies\n   - May expect me to stick with winning move\n\n5. Strategic considerations:\n   - They just lost with rock\n   - Might expect me to stick with paper\n   - Could counter with scissors\n   - Or might return to their successful prediction pattern\n\n6. Decision: I will play rock\n   - If they play scissors to beat expected paper repeat, I win\n   - If they play paper to beat this rock, they show they're still reading well\n   - This move:\n   * Avoids the obvious paper repeat\n   * Protects against scissors counter\n   * Shows composed strategy rather than momentum chasing\n   * Maintains unpredictability after breaking their streak\n\n[move] rock Making a calculated change after success while protecting against obvious counters.\n"

Pattern analysis:\n   - Brief momentum break was countered\n   - Opponent quickly readapted after their loss\n   - Paper has been particularly successful for them\n   - They've beaten my rock plays consistently\n\n3. Opponent insights:\n   - Shows remarkable recovery ability\n   - Maintains strong prediction skills\n   - Uses paper effectively and frequently\n   - Doesn't get rattled by occasional losses\n\n4. Psychological state:\n   - Back to -2 points\n   - Need to avoid frustration\n   - Must break their paper dominance\n   - Can't let previous losses affect decision\n\n5. Strategic evaluation:\n   - They might expect scissors from me to counter paper\n   - Could be baiting scissors to use rock\n   - Paper has been their go-to move for control\n   - Need to break their confidence with paper\n\n6. Decision: I will play scissors\n   - Direct counter to their repeated paper success\n   - Sometimes obvious move is right move\n   - If they play rock, they prove superior prediction again\n   - If they stick with paper, we break their control\n   - Need to challenge their paper comfort zone\n   - Making a clear, committed decision rather than trying to be clever\n\n[move] scissors Taking direct action against their paper dominance while accepting the risk of prediction.\n"
