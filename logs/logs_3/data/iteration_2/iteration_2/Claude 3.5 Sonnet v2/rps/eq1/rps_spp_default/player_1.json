    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

The difference between sequential and simultaneous games\n2. The importance of information structure in games\n3. Why traditional rock-paper-scissors must be simultaneous to be meaningful\n4. How perfect information for one player can make a game's outcome predetermined\n5. Why understanding game structure is more fundamental than strategy\n\nEach additional round simply adds another decimal place to the already infinitesimal probability that this could occur in a fair simultaneous game.\n"

The probability against this sequence occurring in a fair simultaneous game is now (1/3)^21, or approximately 0.00000000000953% - a number so small it effectively proves that the game mechanics must be sequential rather than simultaneous.

To put this in perspective: you would be more likely to correctly guess a specific atom from among all atoms in a large room than to see this sequence occur by chance in a fair game. This conclusively proves that our game deviates from traditional rock-paper-scissors by allowing the opponent to see my moves before choosing theirs.\n"
