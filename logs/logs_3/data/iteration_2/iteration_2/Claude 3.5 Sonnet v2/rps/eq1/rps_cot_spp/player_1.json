    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For identifying patterns and predicting opponent behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, when playing against a fresh opponent with no prior history, it's important to consider the basic probabilities. Each move has equal chance of winning, losing, or drawing against a random opponent.\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is the first move and we have no prior data on the opponent's behavior, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. However, we should pay attention to any patterns that emerge in subsequent moves.\n\nRisk Manager: In terms of risk management, all three moves carry equal risk in this first round. However, studies have shown that \"rock\" is often a common first move choice for many players, as it's perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\"\n\nGame Strategist: Based on that insight, we could counter the likely \"rock\" play with \"paper.\" However, if the opponent is sophisticated, they might anticipate this and play \"scissors.\"\n\nPattern Analyst: Without any historical data, I agree we should focus on basic game theory principles.\n\nRisk Manager: A balanced approach would be best for this first move, as we have no information to justify taking any particular risks.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's go with \"paper\" as it counters the common first-move \"rock\" tendency, while accepting the balanced risk profile.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] paper (Countering potential \"rock\" first move tendency while maintaining balanced risk)\n"

They could be expecting us to switch to rock or scissors after a tie\n3. They might stick with paper hoping we'll change\n\nGame Strategist: Given that both players chose paper, we need to consider the psychological dynamics at play. After a tie, players often feel compelled to change their move, thinking their opponent will do the same.\n\nRisk Manager: The fact that our opponent chose paper indicates they're either thinking similarly to us or might have their own strategic reasoning. We need to be careful about over-interpreting a single data point.\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I suggest we play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they stick with paper (which some players do after a tie), we win\n2. If they switch to rock (expecting us to play paper again), we lose\n3. If they switch to scissors (thinking we'll stay with paper), we tie\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with scissors. Most players don't stick with the same move after a tie, but if they do, we win. If they're thinking multiple levels deep, they might expect us to switch to rock to beat their potential scissors, in which case our scissors would lose to their paper.\n\nRisk Manager: The scissors play offers a good risk-reward ratio here. Even though we could lose if they switch to rock, the psychological tendency to change moves after a tie makes this less likely.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors (Strategic response to previous tie with paper, anticipating either paper repeat or predictable change patterns)\n"

Our opponent has played:\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nThis shows they're willing to change strategies and might be actively trying to counter our moves.\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent seems to be playing reactively and successfully predicted our scissors move. They might be using higher-level strategic thinking. Let's analyze possible scenarios:\n1. They might stick with rock after their success\n2. They might expect us to play paper to counter their rock\n3. They could switch to scissors expecting our paper\n\nRisk Manager: We've lost one round, so we need to be more careful. The opponent has demonstrated good strategic thinking. They've shown they can adapt and aren't using simple patterns.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their apparent sophistication, they're likely to expect us to play paper to counter their rock. If they expect this, they might switch to scissors. Therefore, I suggest we play rock.\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree. Playing rock would:\n- Beat their scissors if they're trying to counter our expected paper\n- Tie if they stick with rock after their win\n- Lose only if they accurately predict this exact logic and play paper\n\nRisk Manager: The rock play offers good defensive value here.

We need to change our approach significantly.\n\nPattern Analyst: Given their success rate, they might have developed a good read on our decision-making process. We need to break their pattern recognition.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest we use paper here. Here's why:\n1. If they're expecting us to play scissors to counter their paper, they might play rock\n2. Their own pattern shows paper -> rock -> paper, so they might break this pattern\n3. Paper would win against their potential rock play\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with paper. At this point, trying to outthink their predictions hasn't worked.

We just won our first round, breaking their winning streak. The opponent might:\n1. Break their paper-rock alternating pattern since we've noticed it\n2. Continue their pattern (which would mean paper next) thinking we won't believe they'll be so predictable\n3. Try to double-bluff us by making us think they'll break the pattern\n\nRisk Manager: We finally have a positive moment to build on. While we're still at -1 points overall, we need to capitalize on this possible pattern recognition.\n\nPattern Analyst: If they truly are following the paper-rock alternation, they should play paper this round. However, now that we've won a round, they might adapt their strategy.\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. If they maintain their pattern and play paper, we win\n2. If they try to double-bluff and play paper anyway, we win\n3. If they break pattern with rock, we lose, but it's a calculated risk worth taking\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors.

This shows they're adaptable and likely recognized we had caught onto their pattern.\n\nGame Strategist: The tie with scissors has created an interesting situation. After ties, based on our previous experience in Round 1-2, this opponent tends to make strong counter-moves. They've also shown they're willing to break patterns once detected.\n\nRisk Manager: We're still at -1 points overall. The opponent has demonstrated they're:\n1. Good at pattern recognition\n2. Willing to break their own patterns\n3. Effective at countering predictable moves\n\nPattern Analyst: Since both players chose scissors last round, there might be a psychological tendency to avoid scissors this round. The opponent might expect us to play rock to beat their potential scissors repeat.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this analysis, I suggest we play paper. Here's why:\n1. If they expect us to play rock (to beat potential scissors), paper wins\n2. If they try to counter our expected rock with paper, we tie\n3.

We need to focus on the immediate situation - they've just won with scissors and shown a willingness to repeat winning moves.\n\nPattern Analyst: The simplest and most direct counter to their potential scissors repeat would be rock.

While they might expect it as an obvious counter, consider:\n1. If they repeat scissors again, we win\n2. If they try to counter our rock with paper, they risk us playing scissors instead\n3.

Able to adapt their strategy effectively\n\nRisk Manager: At -5 points, we need to acknowledge that this opponent is likely using a superior algorithm or strategy system. Traditional game theory approaches aren't working.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at their last few moves: scissors -> paper\nIf they have a strong predictive system, they likely know we're getting desperate at -5 points.\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, I suggest scissors. Here's why:\n1. We haven't used it in a while, making it less predictable\n2. If they think we're desperate and will use rock as a \"strong\" move, they might play paper again\n3. Even if they predict this logic, we can't do worse than trying to outthink them\n\nRisk Manager: Agreed. We've tried everything else.

The opponent has moved from their earlier aggressive winning strategy to a more cautious approach\n2. They're matching our moves more often now, possibly trying to stop our momentum\n3.

The opponent continues to demonstrate superior game understanding.\n\nGame Strategist: After a rock-rock tie, we need to consider:\n1. They might expect us to play paper as the logical counter\n2. They could stick with rock expecting us to overthink\n3. They've shown they can use our logical deductions against us\n\nRisk Manager: At -6 points with a fresh tie, we need to:\n- Avoid predictable responses\n- Make moves that have clear winning potential\n- Not fall into obvious strategic traps\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent has consistently shown they can:\n1. Predict our strategic thinking\n2. Use our pattern recognition against us\n3. Stay multiple steps ahead in the game\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play scissors. Here's why:\n1. Most players would play paper after a rock tie\n2. The opponent likely expects us to play paper to counter their potential rock repeat\n3. If they try to counter our expected paper with scissors, we tie\n4. If they stick with rock, we lose but we avoid the most obvious trap\n\nRisk Manager: I agree with scissors because:\n- It avoids the most predictable paper play\n- Shows we can make unexpected moves\n- Even though it's risky against potential rock, being predictable has cost us more\n\nPattern Analyst: Against an opponent of this caliber, sometimes the best move is one that breaks from obvious strategic progression, even if it carries more risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors (Making an unexpected play that avoids the obvious paper counter while accepting calculated risk)\n"

Still at -6 points, but the pattern of matching moves is interesting.\n\nGame Strategist: The triple tie sequence with matching moves suggests:\n1. Both players are thinking similarly\n2. The opponent might be using mirroring as a strategy (like earlier)\n3. We might be falling into a pattern trap again\n\nRisk Manager: While ties aren't losses, at -6 points we need to find ways to win. However, the last time we broke from a mirroring pattern (after three ties), we lost.\n\nPattern Analyst: Looking at our last mirror-breaking attempt:\n- We had three ties\n- We tried to break the pattern\n- The opponent predicted and countered us successfully\n\nGame Strategist: Let's play rock. Here's why:\n1. After scissors-scissors, many players will expect rock-rock to be too obvious\n2. If they try to counter our expected paper with scissors, we win\n3. If they play paper expecting us to play rock, we lose but it's a calculated risk\n\nRisk Manager: Rock makes sense because:\n- It's strong against the likely scissors continuation\n- Avoids the trap of playing paper just because it beats the previous move\n- Shows we've learned from our previous experiences with mirror-breaking attempts\n\nPattern Analyst: The opponent might expect us to avoid rock since it's the \"obvious\" counter to scissors, making it potentially unexpected.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock (Making a strong fundamental play that protects against scissors while avoiding overthinking the mirror pattern)\n"
