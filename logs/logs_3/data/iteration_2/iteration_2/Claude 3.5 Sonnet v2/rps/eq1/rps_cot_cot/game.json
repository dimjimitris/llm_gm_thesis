Analyzing the game mechanics:\n   - Rock beats scissors\n   - Paper beats rock\n   - Scissors beats paper\n   - All moves are equally balanced\n\n3. Strategic considerations for first move:\n   - Without prior information, all moves have equal expected value\n   - Rock is often a common first choice for many players\n   - Paper would beat a rock-playing opponent\n   - However, this is just speculation without data\n\n4. Given the balanced nature and lack of information:\n   - A random choice would be reasonable\n   - But I'll choose paper as it beats the commonly chosen rock\n   - If opponent chooses scissors, I'll learn from this\n\n5. Making my decision:\n   - Choose paper for first move to counter potential rock\n   - This provides good coverage against a common opening move\n   - Accepts the risk against scissors\n\n[move] paper (Opening with paper to counter potential rock play)\n"

Decision making:\n   - Given this is a fresh start\n   - Without any pattern to analyze\n   - Paper has potential advantage against predicted Rock\n   - Risk of opponent choosing Scissors exists but is acceptable\n\n[move] paper I choose paper as an opening move, anticipating a possible Rock first strategy from my opponent.\n"

Opponent analysis:\n   - They've shown strategic thinking (paper opening)\n   - They've demonstrated similar reasoning to mine\n   - They might be analyzing my pattern as well\n\n4.

Recent sequence analysis:\n   - Round 10: Rock vs Scissors (WIN)\n   - Round 11: Scissors vs Scissors (TIE)\n   - Round 12: Paper vs Scissors (LOSS)\n   - Total score: -3 points\n   - Opponent has stuck with Scissors twice now\n\n2. Opponent pattern analysis:\n   - They've shown commitment to Scissors recently\n   - They successfully predicted my Paper play\n   - They might be getting more aggressive\n   - They're demonstrating confidence with repeated Scissors\n\n3. Psychological factors:\n   - After two successful Scissors plays (tie + win)\n   - Opponent might:\n      * Feel confident to continue with Scissors\n      * Expect me to play Rock to counter their Scissors\n      * Switch to Paper anticipating my Rock\n   - I'm coming from a loss, need to break their momentum\n\n4. Risk evaluation:\n   - Rock would:\n      * Win against continued Scissors play\n      * Lose against Paper if they predict it\n      * Be a logical counter to their Scissors streak\n   - Paper would be risky given their Scissors preference\n   - Scissors would be bold but might surprise them\n\n5. Strategic consideration:\n   - Need to counter their aggressive Scissors play\n   - But they might expect this obvious counter\n   - They've shown ability to predict conventional responses\n   - Rock is obvious choice but might be too obvious\n\n6. Decision making:\n   - Despite Rock being obvious, it's the right move because:\n      * Opponent's double Scissors play needs to be countered\n      * Even if they expect it, they might not switch\n      * Sometimes obvious moves are best moves\n      * Risk of them switching to Paper is acceptable\n\n[move] rock I choose rock to counter their established Scissors pattern, accepting that sometimes the obvious move is the correct one.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",
