    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messsages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

These matching sequences suggest my opponent is either very good at predicting my moves or we're falling into similar thought patterns. After this rock-rock tie, they might expect me to either stick with rock (continuing the tie pattern) or switch to scissors (trying to break the pattern unexpectedly). I'll play paper - if they stay with rock, I'll win. If they predict I'll stick with rock and play paper themselves, we'll tie. This feels like a balanced choice between aggression and safety.\n"

This consistent matching suggests we're either reading each other very well or falling into a predictable pattern. After this paper-paper tie, the most obvious move would be scissors to beat paper, and my opponent likely knows this. They might play scissors expecting me to stay with paper, or they might play rock expecting me to play scissors to break the paper tie. I'm choosing rock - if they play scissors (the most obvious choice), I'll win, and if they play paper again, I'll lose, but I think they're more likely to try to break this tie streak with scissors.\n"
