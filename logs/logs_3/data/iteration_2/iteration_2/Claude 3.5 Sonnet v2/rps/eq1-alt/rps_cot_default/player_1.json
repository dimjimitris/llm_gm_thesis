    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

I'm glad my moves worked out despite my momentary confusion about the rules.\n\n[move] scissors I'm on a three-win streak now! After winning with rock against their paper, they might expect me to stick with rock since it's been successful. If they try to counter that with paper again, scissors would win. If they try to predict this scissors play and match it, we tie - which is fine given my strong lead. Even if they try to counter scissors with rock, I can afford to take that risk from my +3 position.\n"

While I'm still not entirely sure about how the win conditions are being determined (as they seem to be different from traditional RPS rules), I've had success by making moves that feel strategically sound based on predicting my opponent's likely choices.
