    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyzer - For identifying potential patterns in opponent's behavior\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n\nLet's start the collaboration:\n\nGame Strategist: In the first round against a fresh player, we don't have any prior information about their strategy. In such cases, we should consider the Nash equilibrium, which suggests each move should be played with equal probability (1/3) to prevent being exploited.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Since this is the first move and we have no historical data, we can't identify any patterns yet. However, many players tend to choose Rock as their first move, as it's perceived as a \"strong\" opening.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that this is the first move, we should avoid being too predictable. While Rock is common, that might make it risky. Paper could be a good counter to a Rock-heavy opening strategy while not being too vulnerable to Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with the Risk Manager. Paper has good potential as an opening move, as it beats the common Rock opening while only being vulnerable to Scissors, which is less commonly used as an opening move.\n\nPattern Analyzer: We can also use this move to start gathering data about our opponent's playing style.\n\n[move] Paper\nThis move counters the common Rock opening while establishing an initial strategic position.\n"

They might be using a similar strategic reasoning to ours\n2. They might stick with Paper since it resulted in a tie\n3. They might anticipate us switching and adjust accordingly\n\nGame Strategist: In game theory, after a tie, players often tend to either:\n- Stick with their previous move hoping the opponent switches\n- Switch to a move that would have beaten their previous move\n- Switch to a move that would have beaten what would have beaten their previous move\n\nRisk Manager: Given that our opponent showed similar strategic thinking by choosing Paper, we should be careful about being too predictable. They might anticipate us switching to Scissors to beat their potential Paper repeat.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. If they're thinking at that level, they might choose Rock to counter our potential Scissors. In that case, Paper would be strong again.\n\nPattern Analyzer: However, if they're using simpler logic, they might just stick with Paper since it didn't lose, in which case Scissors would be optimal.\n\nRisk Manager: The safest play might be Rock here. It beats a potential Scissors if they think we'll repeat Paper, and it only loses to a Paper repeat which seems less likely given the sophisticated opening.\n\nGame Strategist: I concur with Rock. It protects against the most likely strategic responses while maintaining a balanced position.\n\n[move] Rock\nThis move protects against potential Scissors while maintaining a strong strategic position.\n"

A preference for Paper\n2. A relatively simple strategy of sticking to one move until it loses\n3. Or they might drastically change strategy after this loss\n\nGame Strategist: This is a critical moment. After a loss, players often:\n1. Switch to what would have beaten their losing move (Scissors)\n2. Switch to what would have beaten their opponent's winning move (Paper)\n3. Completely change their approach due to frustration\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they've shown a preference for Paper and just lost with it, there's a high probability they'll switch. The question is: to what?\n\nPattern Analyzer: The psychological impact of losing might push them away from Paper. If they're thinking strategically, they might expect us to use Rock again since it just won.\n\nGame Strategist: If they expect Rock, they might choose Paper again to beat it. However, that seems unlikely after just losing with Paper. They're more likely to switch to Scissors to beat our potential Paper, or Rock to establish a new pattern.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, Rock would be risky as they're unlikely to use Paper a third time. Scissors would be vulnerable if they switch to Rock. Paper would beat Rock if they're trying to establish a new pattern with it.\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend Paper. It beats Rock (their most likely choice if they're trying to break their Paper pattern), and if they choose Scissors (their other likely choice), we only lose one point but gain valuable information about their strategy.\n\n[move] Paper\nThis move anticipates a likely switch to Rock by our opponent while accepting the calculated risk of them choosing Scissors.\n"

This might suggest they're testing different options to find what works. The fact that they just won with Scissors might influence their next choice.\n\nRisk Manager: After their win with Scissors, we need to consider two main possibilities:\n1. They might stick with Scissors since it just won\n2. They might anticipate us adapting to their Scissors play and switch again\n\nPattern Analyzer: Players who just won often exhibit one of two behaviors:\n- Stick with the winning move (suggesting they might use Scissors again)\n- Try to stay one step ahead (anticipating our counter to Scissors)\n\nGame Strategist: If they stick with Scissors, Rock would be optimal. If they try to counter our potential Rock with Paper, then Scissors would be optimal. The key is they just had their first success with Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they've shown adaptability and just had success, there's a higher probability they'll stick with Scissors. People tend to repeat successful moves, especially after trying different options.\n\nGame Strategist: I strongly recommend Rock here. It beats their most likely play (Scissors), and even if they switch to Paper, we've already accumulated enough points to absorb a loss while gathering more information about their strategy.\n\n[move] Rock\nThis move counters the highly probable Scissors repeat while maintaining a strong strategic position based on our point advantage.\n"

They've now had success with both Scissors and Paper in the last two rounds, which might make them feel they've found good strategies. However, they've returned to their apparent preferred move (Paper).\n\nRisk Manager: The fact that they just won with Paper is significant. This reinforces their earlier Paper strategy and might make them more likely to stick with it, especially since it's worked 50% of the time for them.\n\nPattern Analyzer: There's also a pattern of them staying with moves that win. After winning with Scissors, they changed and won with Paper. The psychological momentum is with them after two wins.\n\nGame Strategist: Given their demonstrated preference for Paper and their recent success with it, there's a high probability they'll stick with Paper. Even if they try to get clever and switch, Paper appears to be their comfort move.\n\nRisk Manager: While they could try to surprise us with Rock or Scissors, their behavior suggests a strong Paper bias. In this case, the clear counter is Scissors.\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Scissors is the optimal play here. It:\n1. Beats their most likely move (Paper)\n2. Punishes their apparent comfort zone\n3.

After a tie with Scissors, players often:\n1. Try to break the deadlock by switching\n2. Attempt to outthink their opponent about who will switch first\n3. Stay with Scissors hoping the other player switches\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has shown they're capable of adapting and seem to be playing at a sophisticated level. They've moved away from their Paper preference when needed.\n\nPattern Analyzer: The symmetry of both players choosing Scissors might prompt them to switch. Given their previous patterns, they might return to Paper, which has been their most successful move.\n\nGame Strategist: However, that might be too obvious. A sophisticated player might anticipate that we'd expect them to return to Paper and instead choose Rock to beat our potential Scissors.\n\nRisk Manager: The safest play here would be Paper.

The opponent has shown they can think strategically and adapt. \n\nRisk Manager: After two consecutive ties, there's usually a strong urge to break the pattern. The question is: who will make the first move to break it?\n\nPattern Analyzer: Looking at their overall pattern, they've used:\n- Paper: 4 times\n- Scissors: 2 times\n- Rock: 0 times\nThe complete absence of Rock in their gameplay is notable.\n\nGame Strategist: This is a key insight. They haven't used Rock once in six rounds. This could mean either:\n1. They're saving it for a crucial moment\n2. They have a psychological aversion to using Rock\n3. They're about to use it because we might think they won't\n\nRisk Manager: Given we just tied with Paper, and they haven't shown Rock yet, there's a significant chance they might finally use it to break the tie streak. We should consider this carefully.\n\nGame Strategist: If they're playing at a high level, they might expect us to anticipate their first Rock play and try to counter it with Paper. In that case, they would use Scissors.\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their comfort with Paper and Scissors, combined with the recent ties, suggests they're more likely to stay within their demonstrated move set rather than suddenly introduce Rock.\n\nGame Strategist: In this case, I recommend Scissors.

The obvious move would be Rock to beat Scissors\n2. They've shown they can anticipate our strategic thinking\n3. They might expect us to avoid the obvious play\n\nPattern Analyzer: Key observations:\n- They're comfortable playing Scissors repeatedly\n- They win when they make unexpected moves\n- They're excellent at matching our strategic level\n\nGame Strategist: At this point, making the obvious play (Rock) might actually be the most sophisticated choice because:\n1. They might expect us to avoid it as too obvious\n2. They've shown they win when we try to be too clever\n3. Sometimes the straightforward play is the best against a sophisticated opponent\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. Rock is our best option because:\n1. It directly beats Scissors if they repeat again\n2. It beats Scissors if they think we'll overcomplicate our strategy\n3. Only loses to Paper, which would be their most complex counter\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological dynamics favor Rock here. After multiple Scissors ties, going with the fundamental counter might be the most unexpected move.\n\n[move] Rock\nThis move makes the fundamental play while acknowledging that against a sophisticated opponent, sometimes the obvious choice is the strongest choice.\n"

Feel they need to break their recent pattern of losses\n2. Expect us to use Paper to counter their potential Rock\n3. Consider Scissors to beat our potential Paper\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their behavior patterns show:\n- They adapt quickly after losses\n- They're good at breaking patterns when needed\n- They often make strong counters to obvious plays\n\nGame Strategist: Given their sophisticated play style, they're likely thinking:\n1. We might expect them to use Rock as a basic reset\n2. We might then use Paper to beat that Rock\n3. Therefore, Scissors would be their optimal counter\n\nRisk Manager: In this case, Rock would be our strongest play because:\n1. It beats Scissors (their most sophisticated counter to our potential Paper)\n2. It loses to Paper, but they just lost with Paper and might avoid it\n3. It beats any attempt by them to reset with Scissors\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with Rock. Here's why:\n- It counters their most likely sophisticated play (Scissors)\n- It avoids the trap of making the obvious play (Paper)\n- It maintains pressure after our recent win\n\n[move] Rock\nThis move anticipates their sophisticated counter to obvious responses while maintaining strong strategic position after our win.\n"

The conventional response would be Paper\n2. They've shown they can anticipate conventional plays\n3. They might expect us to avoid the obvious Paper play\n\nRisk Manager: The situation is delicate:\n- Paper is the obvious counter to Rock\n- Scissors would counter their potential Paper\n- They might stick with Rock expecting us to overthink\n\nPattern Analyzer: Their pattern in recent ties shows:\n- They match our strategic level consistently\n- They're comfortable playing multiple ties\n- They often break tie streaks with unexpected moves\n\nGame Strategist: The psychological dynamics suggest:\n1. Both players might want to break the tie pattern\n2. The obvious Paper play might be too predictable\n3. They might expect us to overthink and avoid Paper\n\nRisk Manager: However, sometimes the obvious play is the right play, especially when both players are trying to outthink each other.
