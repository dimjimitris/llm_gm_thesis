    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Pattern Analyst - For studying opponent behavior and adapting strategies\n3. Risk Manager - For evaluating risk-reward tradeoffs\n4. AI Assistant (me) - For making the final decision\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's analyze the payoff matrix first:\n- Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (3 points)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Medium reward (1 point)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Medium reward (1 point)\nPaper offers the highest potential reward but also the highest risk (-1 for losing to scissors).\n\nPattern Analyst: Since this is a fresh player, we don't have any historical data to analyze patterns. We're starting from scratch.\n\nRisk Manager: In the absence of prior information, we should consider balancing potential reward with risk. Paper has the highest reward potential (3 points) but also carries risk. Rock is a safer play as it can win with 1 point and worst case loses 3 points to paper.\n\nGame Strategist: Given this is the first move and we have no information about the opponent, I suggest going with paper. Here's why:\n1. Highest reward potential (3 points)\n2. Against a fresh player, rock is often a common first move\n3. Even if we lose to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n\nRisk Manager: I agree. While paper carries risk, the reward-to-risk ratio is favorable (potential gain of 3 vs potential loss of 1).\n\nAI Assistant: Based on the analysis, I'll go with paper for the first move since it offers the best reward potential, and even in the worst case, our loss is minimal.\n\n[move] paper I'm choosing paper as it offers the highest potential reward (3 points), and even in the worst case scenario of losing to scissors, the penalty is only -1 points.\n"

They might be following a similar strategic reasoning as us\n2. They might switch their move now to try to counter what they think we'll play\n3. They could stick to paper hoping we'll switch\n\nGame Strategist: Let's think through the opponent's likely reasoning:\n- They might expect us to switch away from paper since it was a tie\n- Common psychology suggests they might expect us to play rock or scissors next\n- However, they might also stick to paper themselves expecting us to play rock\n\nRisk Manager: Given that they showed strategic thinking by playing paper first, we should be cautious. If they expect us to switch to rock (a common response after paper), they might stick with paper to get 3 points.\n\nPattern Analyst: I suggest playing scissors here because:\n1. If they stick with paper, we win 1 point\n2. If they switch to rock expecting us to play paper again, we only lose 1 point\n3. If they switch to scissors themselves, it's a tie\n\nGame Strategist: I agree with scissors. It's a balanced move that could capitalize if they stick to paper, and minimizes our loss if we're wrong.\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for scissors is good here. Maximum gain of 1 point, maximum loss of 1 point. It's our safest play while still maintaining winning potential.\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis makes sense. Scissors provides a balanced risk-reward profile and could capitalize on the opponent potentially sticking to paper.\n\n[move] scissors Based on the opponent's paper play in the first round, scissors offers a good balance of potentially winning against repeated paper while minimizing potential losses.\n"

Let's analyze:\n1. They might be frustrated from losing and switch to rock to counter our scissors\n2. They could switch to scissors expecting us to play paper\n3. They might even stick to paper for a third time, though this seems less likely\n\nGame Strategist: The opponent has shown a pattern of playing conservatively (paper has the highest potential gain). After losing to scissors, they're likely to adapt. Most players would switch to rock here to:\n1. Counter the scissors that just beat them\n2. Protect against another scissors play\n3. Only risk losing to paper\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, I suggest we play paper because:\n1. If they switch to rock as predicted, we win 3 points\n2. If they switch to scissors, we lose only 1 point\n3. If they somehow stick to paper, it's a tie\n\nPattern Analyst: I agree with paper. The opponent's likely adaptation to their recent loss makes rock their most probable move. They might think we'll get overconfident with scissors after our win.\n\nGame Strategist: Paper also maintains our unpredictability - we've now played paper, scissors, and would be playing paper again but in a different context.\n\nAI Assistant: The consensus for paper is strong. It capitalizes on the likely psychology of an opponent who just lost to scissors, while keeping our potential losses minimal.\n\n[move] paper Given our opponent's likely adaptation after losing to scissors, they may play rock to counter our previous move.

They've lost twice now (1 point, then 3 points)\n3. They might be getting frustrated and more likely to make an aggressive move\n\nGame Strategist: This is a crucial psychological moment. After two losses (especially a big 3-point loss), players often:\n1. Become more aggressive\n2. Try to break patterns\n3. Attempt to \"double guess\" their opponent\n\nRisk Manager: The opponent has now lost 4 points total. They're likely to:\n1. Either become very aggressive (scissors would be their most aggressive option)\n2. Or try to play it safe and rebuild with rock\n\nPattern Analyst: I think scissors is their most likely play because:\n1. They need to recover points\n2. They might expect us to play paper again after it just worked\n3. Aggressive plays are common when players are behind\n\nGame Strategist: I agree. Rock would be too defensive after just losing to paper, and paper would be repetitive of their early strategy that failed. Scissors gives them a chance to win while countering our successful paper play.\n\nRisk Manager: Given this analysis, we should play rock because:\n1. If they play scissors as predicted, we win 1 point\n2. If they play rock, it's a tie\n3. If they play paper, we lose 3 points - but this seems least likely given their situation\n\nAI Assistant: The analysis is compelling. Rock seems like the best move to counter their likely psychological state and strategic position.\n\n[move] rock After two consecutive losses, our opponent is likely to make an aggressive move with scissors to counter our successful paper play.
