    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Data Analyst - Helps analyze patterns and payoff structures\n3. Risk Manager - Evaluates potential gains and losses\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Strategist: Let's first analyze the payoff structure. Paper has the highest potential reward (3 points) but also the highest potential loss (-3 points). Rock and scissors both have lower risk/reward ratios (\u00b11 point).\n\nData Analyst: Since we're playing against a fresh player with no history, we can't rely on pattern recognition yet. We should focus on the expected value of each move.\n\nRisk Manager: Given the asymmetric payoff structure, paper is both the highest risk and highest reward option. For a first move, we might want to balance potential gains and losses.\n\nGame Strategist: I suggest using rock as our first move. Here's why:\n1. If opponent plays scissors, we win 1 point\n2. If opponent plays paper, we lose 3 points\n3. If opponent plays rock, it's a tie (0 points)\nThe balanced nature of rock makes it a reasonable opening move while we learn about our opponent.\n\nData Analyst: Agreed. Rock provides protection against scissors while having a moderate downside against paper. Since we have no prior data on the opponent, this is a sensible first move.\n\nRisk Manager: I concur. While paper offers higher potential reward, the risk of a -3 point loss in our first move might be too aggressive. Rock provides a more balanced risk profile.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Opening with a balanced move to assess the opponent's strategy\n"

They might stick with rock again (some players have this tendency)\n3. They might expect us to switch and try to counter our next move\n\nData Analyst: From the first round we learned:\n- Opponent chose a balanced opening move\n- They might be using similar strategic thinking to ours\n- Given that both players chose rock, there might be a tendency to switch moves to break the tie\n\nRisk Manager: We need to consider:\n- If opponent stays with rock: paper would give us 3 points\n- If opponent switches to paper: scissors would give us 1 point\n- If opponent switches to scissors: rock would give us 1 point\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend playing paper for the following reasons:\n1. If opponent stays with rock (which is common for conservative players), we get the maximum 3 points\n2. If opponent switches to scissors, we only lose 1 point\n3. Breaking the tie pattern often requires making a proactive move\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for paper looks good here. Even if we lose, the opponent has shown conservative play, making scissors less likely.\n\nData Analyst: Agreed.

Second round: both paper\nThis suggests either:\n- They're using a similar strategic thinking process to ours\n- They might be deliberately mirroring our moves\n- They're trying to establish a pattern before breaking it\n\nData Analyst: Pattern analysis shows:\n- Two consecutive matches indicating potential mirroring strategy\n- Progression from rock to paper shows opponent is willing to change moves\n- No aggressive moves (scissors) have been played yet by either player\n\nRisk Manager: Let's consider our options:\n1. If opponent continues mirroring: any move results in 0 points\n2. If opponent expects scissors from us: they might play rock\n3. If opponent tries to counter expected paper: they might play scissors\n4. If opponent tries to counter expected rock: they might play paper\n\nGame Strategist: In this situation, I recommend scissors because:\n1.

If opponent is truly mirroring, they will match whatever we do\n2. If opponent expects us to restart the cycle with rock, they might play paper\n3. If opponent expects us to outsmart a paper play, they might play scissors\n4.

Against a perfect mirror, any move results in 0 points\n2. Rock beats scissors if they continue the natural progression\n3. Rock is the expected move if restarting the cycle, making it potentially unexpected\n4. Maximum loss is -3 (vs paper), but the demonstrated conservative play makes this less likely\n\nData Analyst: The completion of one full cycle is a natural point for pattern disruption.

If opponent tries scissors again: rock would win again (+1)\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend paper for these reasons:\n1. Opponents often avoid repeating a losing move (making scissors less likely)\n2. After a loss, many players reset to rock as a safe option\n3. Even if they play scissors (worst case), we only lose 1 point\n4. If they play rock, we get maximum 3 points\n5.

Recent sequence:\n   - Round 19: Lost to paper (-3)\n   - Round 20: Tie with scissors (0)\n   - Round 21: Won with paper (+3)\n   - Round 22: Tie with scissors (0)\nScore remains even, but scissors ties are becoming very frequent.\n\nData Analyst: Critical patterns:\n- Their last moves: scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\n- High frequency of scissors deadlocks\n- They mirror our scissors plays consistently\n- Game showing cyclical nature with scissors ties\n\nRisk Manager: Current situation:\n1. Even score provides strategic flexibility\n2. Multiple scissors ties suggest:\n   - Pattern fatigue\n   - Potential for strategic shift\n   - Need to break deadlock effectively\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend rock because:\n1. Strong strategic reasons:\n   - High frequency of scissors plays suggests continuation\n   - Opponents often stick with scissors after ties, thinking opponent will switch\n   - Breaking scissors deadlock with rock has worked before\n2. They might expect us to play paper following our previous success\n3. Even score allows for this calculated play\n\nRisk Manager: The risk-reward ratio for rock is favorable:\n- Win condition likely given scissors frequency\n- Even if they counter with paper, we're only -3\n- Need to break out of scissors stalemate\n\nData Analyst: Statistical analysis shows:\n- High probability of continued scissors after multiple ties\n- Players often stick with scissors expecting opponent to break pattern\n- Rock has historically broken scissors deadlocks successfully\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] rock Breaking repetitive scissors pattern while seeking positive momentum\n"

First lead in several rounds (+1)\n2. They might:\n   - Be frustrated after another scissors loss\n   - Try to counter our successful rock\n   - Finally abandon scissors strategy\n3. Need to protect our lead while remaining unpredictable\n\nGame Strategist: I recommend scissors because:\n1. Strong psychological reasons:\n   - They've lost twice to defensive moves (paper, rock)\n   - They likely expect us to stick with winning rock\n   - Under pressure, they often switch to paper to counter rock\n2. If they play rock, we only lose 1 point\n3. Need to avoid becoming predictable with rock\n\nRisk Manager: Agree with scissors:\n- Limited downside (-1 if wrong)\n- Protects against paper counter to expected rock\n- Maintains unpredictable strategy while leading\n\nData Analyst: Their recent losses suggest high probability of switching to paper to counter expected rock. Scissors provides optimal coverage while limiting potential losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] scissors Countering potential paper play while protecting small lead\n"
