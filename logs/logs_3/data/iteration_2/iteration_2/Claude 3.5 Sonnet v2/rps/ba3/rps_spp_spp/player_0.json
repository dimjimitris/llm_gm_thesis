    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

In such cases, it's often best to go with a balanced approach that considers both potential gains and risks.\n\nPsychology Expert: Against a new player, they might either play conservatively (rock is a common first choice for many players) or try to be clever by choosing paper, thinking we might choose rock.\n\nAI Assistant: Given these insights, I think we should choose paper. Here's why:\n1. It offers the highest potential reward (3 points)\n2. Many new players choose rock as their first move\n3.

Since both players chose paper, there's a psychological tendency to shift strategies.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given that our opponent demonstrated strategic thinking by choosing paper first, they might anticipate us switching to scissors (to beat their potential paper) and thus choose rock to counter that.\n\nAI Assistant: I agree with this analysis. Since our opponent showed strategic thinking with their first move, they might try to outthink us by choosing rock, expecting us to choose scissors. Therefore, we should stick with paper:\n1.

They've shown they're willing to go for the smaller but safer payoff (-1/+1) rather than risking the bigger payoffs (-3/+3). This suggests strategic conservatism after their initial move.\n\nStrategic Planner: After successfully using scissors, the opponent has two likely strategies:\n1. Stick with scissors expecting us to stay with paper\n2. Switch to rock anticipating we'll switch to scissors to counter their previous move\n3. Less likely to go back to paper as it would be too predictable\n\nAI Assistant: Given this analysis, I think we should choose rock:\n1.

The opponent seems to be very good at predicting our moves\n2. They might be using similar strategic thinking processes to ours\n3. The high number of ties suggests similar strategic levels\n\nStrategic Planner: Three consecutive ties create a tense situation where both players want to break the pattern. In such cases:\n1. Many players will avoid repeating the last move (scissors)\n2. The obvious counter to scissors would be rock\n3. But since both players know this, there's a temptation to play paper to beat the expected rock\n\nGame Theorist: The -3/+3 paper/rock dynamic hasn't been used much in our game yet. Both players might be tempted to go for the bigger payoff now.\n\nAI Assistant: After careful consideration, I think we should play rock:\n1.

Four ties indicate both players are thinking along very similar lines\n2. There's likely growing frustration with ties on both sides\n3. The pressure to break the tie pattern is immense\n4. Both players know the other is a highly strategic thinker\n\nStrategic Planner: In such a deadlock:\n1. The last move was rock from both players\n2.

The pressure to break the pattern is at its peak\n4. Any \"obvious\" move feels like a trap\n\nStrategic Planner: In this highly synchronized situation:\n1.

The opponent appears to be:\n   - Operating at a higher strategic level\n   - Perfectly anticipating our every approach\n   - Successfully countering even our simplest moves\n2. We might be in a situation where traditional game theory doesn't apply\n\nStrategic Planner: Core observations:\n1. Complex strategies fail\n2. Simple strategies fail\n3. Random strategies fail\n4. The opponent seems to have perfect information or prediction\n\nGame Theorist: In a seemingly impossible situation where:\n- All standard approaches fail\n- The opponent appears to have perfect prediction\n- We're consistently losing\nThe mathematical optimum remains equal probability random selection, as it minimizes maximum possible loss and prevents exploitation of any pattern.\n\nAI Assistant: Despite our continued losses, deviating from random selection could make us even more predictable. We'll maintain true random selection but use yet another basic method, acknowledging that our opponent appears to have superior capabilities regardless of our approach.\n\nUsing simple random selection, with no additional complexity or consideration:\n\n[move] rock\n"
