    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Since I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, I'll consider the payoff structure:\n- Paper vs Rock: Highest reward (3 points)\n- Rock vs Scissors: Lower reward (1 point)\n- Scissors vs Paper: Lower reward (1 point)\n\nGiven that paper has the potential for the highest reward (3 points), it might be a good opening move. However, if the opponent plays scissors, I would lose 1 point. The risk-reward ratio seems reasonable.\n\n[move] paper Initial move choosing paper as it offers the highest potential reward while having a manageable downside risk\n"
