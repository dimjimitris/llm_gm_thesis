Psychological analysis:\n   - Opponent lost last round\n   - Players often become more aggressive after a loss\n   - They might want to go for the highest possible gain (+3)\n\n3.

Strategic decision:\n   - Given their likely frustration from losing\n   - And the common tendency to go for big gains after a loss\n   - They're more likely to play paper hoping for a +3 win against rock\n   - Therefore scissors would be optimal against paper\n\n[move] scissors Anticipating opponent might go for a high-reward paper play after their loss, scissors provides a good counter while minimizing potential losses.\n"

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached.

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
