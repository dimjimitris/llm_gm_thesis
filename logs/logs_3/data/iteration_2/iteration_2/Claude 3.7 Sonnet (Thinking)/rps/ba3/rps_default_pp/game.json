In classic rock-paper-scissors with no point differentials, there's a Nash equilibrium strategy of randomly selecting each move with 1/3 probability.\n\nHowever, in this variant:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner +3, loser -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner +1, loser -1\n\nThe payoff structure makes paper a more valuable win (if successful) but also a more costly loss. The expected value calculations are:\n\nFor rock:\n- Win against scissors: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3\n- Lose against paper: 1/3 * -3 = -1\n- Tie against rock: 1/3 * 0 = 0\nExpected value: 1/3 - 1 + 0 = -2/3\n\nFor paper:\n- Win against rock: 1/3 * 3 = 1\n- Lose against scissors: 1/3 * -1 = -1/3\n- Tie against paper: 1/3 * 0 = 0\nExpected value: 1 - 1/3 + 0 = 2/3\n\nFor scissors:\n- Win against paper: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3\n- Lose against rock: 1/3 * -1 = -1/3\n- Tie against scissors: 1/3 * 0 = 0\nExpected value: 1/3 - 1/3 + 0 = 0\n\nBased on these expected values against a player using a uniformly random strategy:\n- Paper has the highest expected value (2/3)\n- Scissors is neutral (0)\n- Rock has a negative expected value (-2/3)\n\nGiven this analysis, for my first move, I will choose paper as it has the highest expected value against a player with unknown strategy.",

This gives me some information that my opponent might favor scissors as their move, but I can't be sure if this is a pattern or just a one-time choice.\n\nLet's analyze the game a bit more:\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n\nSince my opponent played scissors last time, they might:\n1.

Switch to paper if they think I'll switch to rock\n\nIf I play rock:\n- If they play scissors again: I win +1\n- If they switch to rock: It's a tie, 0 points\n- If they switch to paper: I lose -3\n\nIf I play paper:\n- If they play scissors again: I lose -1\n- If they switch to rock: I win +3\n- If they switch to paper: It's a tie, 0 points\n\nIf I play scissors:\n- If they play scissors again: It's a tie, 0 points\n- If they switch to rock: I lose -1\n- If they switch to paper: I win +1\n\nGiven that they just won with scissors, there's a chance they might play scissors again. If I play rock, I have a chance to win +1 or at worst tie if they switch to rock. The only bad outcome is if they anticipate my move and switch to paper, in which case I lose 3 points.\n\nI think playing rock is my best option for this round.",

I need to develop a strategy. In Rock Paper Scissors, predicting the opponent's next move is key. There are a few possible approaches:\n\n1. Random choice: Just randomly select between rock, paper, scissors\n2. Pattern recognition: Try to identify if the opponent follows patterns\n3. Counter-strategy: Predict opponent's next move and counter it\n4. Frequency analysis: Track what moves the opponent uses most\n\nGiven that the opponent played scissors in round 1 and rock in round 2, they might be rotating through the options. If they're following a pattern like scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 paper, then their next move would be paper. To counter paper, I should play scissors.\n\nAnother possibility is that they're countering what I played previously. I played paper in round 1, and they played rock (which would have tied if I played the same move again). I played rock in round 2, so they might play paper next to counter my previous rock.\n\nSince I have limited data, I'll make a strategic choice. I'll play scissors to counter the potential paper move from the opponent.",

I notice that I have been using a somewhat predictable Rock-Paper-Scissors rotation in recent rounds. Maybe I should try to mix it up a bit.\n\nGiven the pattern of my losses (when I played scissors and they played rock), let me try something different this time. Since I just lost with scissors against rock, I'll try paper which beats rock.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
