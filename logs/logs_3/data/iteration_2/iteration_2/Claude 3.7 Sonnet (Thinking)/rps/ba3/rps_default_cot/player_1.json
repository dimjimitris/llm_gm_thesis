    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first move, I'll consider the payoff asymmetry. Paper offers the highest potential gain.\n\n5.

After a tie, players often change their move. My opponent might expect me to play Scissors to counter their previous Paper.\n\n5. If they anticipate this, they might play Rock to counter my expected Scissors. Therefore, playing Paper would be effective against their Rock.\n\n6. However, this is predictable thinking. They might play Scissors expecting me to stick with Paper.\n\n7.

I need to anticipate my opponent's next move based on their pattern:\n   - They moved from Paper to Scissors, which suggests they were trying to counter my predicted move\n   - They lost with Scissors, so they're likely to change strategy again\n\n3. After losing with Scissors against my Rock, my opponent might:\n   - Play Paper to beat my Rock (assuming I'll repeat my winning move)\n   - Play Rock to break a potential pattern or for safety\n   - Less likely to play Scissors again after just losing with it\n\n4. The most common psychological response after losing is to switch to a move that would have beaten the opponent's previous move (in this case, Paper to beat my Rock).\n\n5.

Historical responses to ties:\n   - After our tie in Round 1, they played Scissors in Round 2\n   - Players often change their move after a tie\n\n4. Considering their tendency:\n   - They favor Paper (6 out of 10 moves)\n   - After consecutive Papers, they may change their strategy\n   - The last time we had a tie (Round 1), they switched to Scissors\n\n5. If they switch to Scissors (as they did after our first tie), Rock would be my best counter.\n   If they maintain Paper, Scissors would be ideal.\n   Given the higher probability of a switch after a tie and their historical pattern, Rock offers the best expected value.\n\n[move] Rock"

Recent pattern analysis:\n   - I just won with Scissors against their Paper\n   - After I previously won with Scissors in Round 15, they played Scissors in Round 16\n   - After my opponent plays Paper and loses, they've typically switched to a different move\n\n4. Predicting their next move:\n   - They likely expect me to play Scissors again (win-stay psychology)\n   - To counter this, they would likely play Rock\n   - Their overall tendency to switch after losing reinforces this prediction\n\n5. Strategic decision:\n   - If they play Rock as predicted: Paper would give me +3 points\n   - If they play Scissors (less likely): Paper would cost me -1 point\n   - If they play Paper (least likely): Paper would result in a tie\n\n[move] Paper"

Analyzing key patterns:\n   - Their sequence: Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors\n   - Critical pattern identified: Every time I've won with Scissors against their Paper (rounds 7, 9, 15, 18), they've followed up with Scissors in the next round\n\n3. Recent cyclical trap:\n   - Round 15: I won with Scissors against Paper\n   - Round 16: They countered with Scissors, I lost with Paper\n   - Round 17: Rock vs Rock tie\n   - Round 18: I won with Scissors against Paper\n   - Round 19: They played Scissors again, I lost with Paper\n\n4. Breaking this pattern:\n   - They just won with Scissors and might expect me to play Rock now\n   - If they anticipate Rock, they might play Paper\n   - However, I need to break my predictable response pattern\n\n5. Since they've won with Scissors twice recently and may be confident in this move, I'll play Rock to counter another potential Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock"

Analyzing post-tie patterns:\n   - After our first tie (Round 1): They played Scissors in Round 2\n   - After our second tie (Round 10): They played Rock in Round 11\n   - After our third tie (Round 11): They played Rock in Round 12\n   - After our fourth tie (Round 17): They played Paper in Round 18\n   - We've now had another Rock-Rock tie\n\n3. Opponent's move distribution:\n   - Paper: 8 times (most frequent)\n   - Rock: 7 times (including the last move)\n   - Scissors: 5 times\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - After two consecutive Rock-Rock ties (Rounds 11 and 20), they've shown different patterns\n   - They've been increasingly using Scissors recently (rounds 16, 19)\n   - They might expect me to play Paper to try to win after our tie\n   - If they anticipate this, they would play Scissors\n\n5. The most strategic counter to their anticipated Scissors would be Rock. However, since we just had a Rock-Rock tie, they might expect this. Given their overall preference for Paper, I'll play Scissors as a counter to their potential Paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

Analyzing opponent's recent moves:\n   - They've now played Rock twice in a row (rounds 20-21)\n   - They've rarely played the same move three times consecutively\n   - Their distribution is now: Rock (8), Paper (8), Scissors (5)\n\n3. Opponent's pattern after consecutive identical moves:\n   - After playing Rock-Rock in rounds 3-4, they switched to Paper\n   - After Paper-Paper in rounds 9-10, they switched to Rock\n   - After Rock-Rock in rounds 11-12, they switched to Scissors\n\n4. Strategic reasoning:\n   - My opponent has never played the same move three times in a row\n   - They're likely to switch after two consecutive Rock plays\n   - Given their equal preference for Paper and Rock overall, Paper is a likely next move\n   - If they anticipate I'll play Paper to beat their Rock, they might play Scissors\n\n5. Playing Paper offers the highest potential reward (+3) if they play Rock again, but has risk. Given their likely switch and my recent losses, I'll play Rock to counter their potential Scissors play.\n\n[move] Rock"
