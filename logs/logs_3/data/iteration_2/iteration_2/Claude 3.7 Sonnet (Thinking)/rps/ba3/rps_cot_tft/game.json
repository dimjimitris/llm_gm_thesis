First, I need to understand the payoff structure of the game:\n   - Rock beats scissors: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Paper beats rock: Winner +3, loser -3\n   - Scissors beats paper: Winner +1, loser -1\n   - Same moves: 0 points (tie)\n\n2. Since this is the first round against a fresh player, I have no prior information about their strategy or tendencies.\n\n3. Analyzing the asymmetric payoffs:\n   - Paper beating rock has higher stakes (+3/-3) than other combinations (+1/-1)\n   - This means paper has the highest potential reward when it wins\n\n4. What might a rational first-time player do?\n   - They might be drawn to paper since it offers the highest reward (+3)\n   - Alternatively, they might avoid rock since losing with rock is costly (-3)\n\n5. My counter-strategy:\n   - If I expect them to play paper, scissors would be optimal\n   - If I lose with scissors to rock, I only lose 1 point instead of 3\n\n6. Balancing risk and reward, scissors seems to be a strategic first move.\n\n[move] scissors"

Considering the game theory aspects:\n   - Paper has the highest reward potential (+3) when winning\n   - Rock was successful for my opponent last round\n   - Players often stick with successful moves, especially in early rounds\n\n3. Weighing my options for this round:\n   - If my opponent plays rock again (which is likely since it worked), paper would be optimal\n   - If my opponent anticipates me switching to paper and plays scissors, I would lose only 1 point\n   - If my opponent plays paper (least likely scenario), I would tie\n\n4.

Analyzing all rounds so far:\n   - Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost 1 point\n   - Round 2: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n   - Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n   - Round 6: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie (0 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won 3 points\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won 1 point\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won 1 point\n\n2. Identifying consistent opponent patterns:\n   - After losing with paper, opponent plays rock:\n     - After round 4 loss with paper \u2192 played rock in round 5\n     - After round 9 loss with paper \u2192 played rock in round 10\n\n3. Pattern confirmation:\n   - The opponent appears to be following a consistent response strategy:\n     - When they lose with rock, they play scissors next\n     - When they lose with scissors, they play paper next\n     - When they lose with paper, they play rock next\n\n4. Strategic evaluation:\n   - If they play rock (highly likely after losing with paper): paper would be optimal (+3)\n   - If they break pattern and play scissors: paper would lose (-1)\n   - If they play paper again (unlikely): paper would tie (0)\n\n5. Decision rationale:\n   - The opponent's pattern has been extremely consistent throughout the game\n   - Playing paper offers the highest expected value against their likely rock move\n\n[move] paper"

Paper beating rock has higher stakes (+3/-3) compared to the other winning combinations (+1/-1). This creates an interesting dynamic.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player who hasn't established any pattern yet, I need to consider which move might be most advantageous as a first move:\n\n1. If I play rock:\n   - If opponent plays rock: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays paper: -3 points (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: +1 point (I win)\n\n2. If I play paper:\n   - If opponent plays rock: +3 points (I win)\n   - If opponent plays paper: 0 points (tie)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: -1 point (I lose)\n\n3. If I play scissors:\n   - If opponent plays rock: -1 point (I lose)\n   - If opponent plays paper: +1 point (I win)\n   - If opponent plays scissors: 0 points (tie)\n\nIn a standard Rock Paper Scissors game without the asymmetric payoffs, all strategies would be equally good in the first round with no prior information. However, with these asymmetric payoffs, I should consider what a rational opponent might do.\n\nA rational opponent might be drawn to play paper since it offers the highest reward (+3) when it wins. If I anticipate this, scissors would be my best response.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent might avoid rock (since losing with rock costs -3), which would make rock a less optimal choice for me.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think playing scissors is a reasonable first move. It counters paper (which has the highest reward potential for the opponent) and if I lose to rock, I only lose 1 point rather than 3.",

After they lose with scissors, they always play paper in the next round:\n- Round 3: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 4: They played paper\n- Round 6: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 7: They played paper\n- Round 8: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 9: They played paper\n- Round 11: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 12: They played paper\n- Round 14: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 15: They played paper\n- Round 17: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 18: They played paper\n- Round 20: They lost with scissors \u2192 Round 21: They played paper\n\nThey just lost with scissors in round 23, so following their established pattern, they're very likely to play paper next. The optimal counter to paper is scissors.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
