    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Paper beating rock gives 3 points, while the other victories only give 1 point. This means paper has the highest expected value if moves were chosen randomly.\n\nStatistical Analyst: That's right. In a standard rock-paper-scissors, all options would be equally viable, but here paper has an advantage. However, if our opponent realizes this, they might be more likely to play scissors to counter.\n\nPsychological Profiler: For a first move against a fresh player, they might default to rock as it's a common intuitive first choice in standard rock-paper-scissors. This would make paper an attractive option.\n\nDecision Strategist: The risk-reward ratio favors paper. If we win with paper, we get 3 points. If we lose with paper, we only lose 1 point. This asymmetry makes paper the optimal opening move.\n\nGame Theorist: Agreed. Even in repeated play, paper would likely be overrepresented in the optimal mixed strategy for this variant because of the payoff structure.\n\n[move] paper"

This suggests our opponent is also aware of the optimal strategy with the asymmetric payoffs.\n\nPsychological Profiler: After ties, players often switch their move, expecting their opponent to repeat. Our opponent might expect us to play paper again, so they might switch to scissors to counter.\n\nStatistical Analyst: We need to consider the common patterns in this game. The \"one step ahead\" thinking would suggest we should play rock now to beat their potential scissors.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's consider the risk-reward ratio again. If we play rock and they play scissors, we gain 1 point. If they play paper again, we lose 3 points. If we play scissors anticipating they'll play paper again, we gain 1 if correct but lose 1 if they switch to rock.\n\nGame Theorist: Given the higher stakes of potentially losing 3 points with rock versus only losing 1 point with scissors, scissors might be the safer play that still gives us a chance to win.\n\nPsychological Profiler: I agree. Scissors counters their previous move, and even if they switch to rock (anticipating our scissors), our penalty is minimized compared to the risk of playing rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

They may be using a \"one step ahead\" approach - thinking about what we'll play next based on the previous outcome.\n\nStatistical Analyst: Given their paper-rock sequence, if they're following a simple rotation pattern (paper-rock-scissors), they might play scissors next. But that's likely too simplistic.\n\nDecision Strategist: Let's consider expected values. If we play rock: we win against potential scissors (+1), tie against rock (0), lose heavily against paper (-3). If we play paper: we win big against rock (+3), tie against paper (0), lose small against scissors (-1).\n\nGame Theorist: The asymmetric payoff structure still favors paper in the long run. Even if we lose with paper, we only lose 1 point, versus losing 3 points if we play rock and they play paper.\n\nPsychological Profiler: Our opponent might expect us to play paper now to counter their rock.

The repetition of scissors could be significant - either they're trying to establish a new pattern or they expected us to switch.\n\nDecision Strategist: If we anticipate they'll switch to paper after the tie, rock would be a risky move (-3 if wrong), while scissors would only tie.

Despite recent outcomes, the asymmetric payoff structure still makes paper the statistically optimal choice in the long run due to its 3/-3 point differential compared to the 1/-1 for other combinations.\n\nGame Theorist: Even if we lose with paper, we only lose 1 point.
