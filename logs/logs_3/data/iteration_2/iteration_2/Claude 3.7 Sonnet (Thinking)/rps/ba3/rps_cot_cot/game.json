Since this is the first round and I have no prior information about my opponent's tendencies or strategies, I need to think about the optimal starting move.\n\nLet me analyze the payoff structure:\n- Paper gives the highest reward (+3) when it wins against Rock\n- Rock and Scissors both give +1 when they win\n- Losing with Rock costs -3 points (the biggest penalty)\n- Losing with Paper or Scissors costs -1 point\n\nGiven this asymmetric payoff structure, there's more upside to playing Paper (potential +3) than Rock or Scissors (potential +1). However, Paper also has risk because if the opponent plays Scissors, I lose 1 point.\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent yet, I might choose Paper as my first move because it has the highest potential reward. While this is somewhat riskier, the expected value calculation favors Paper in a single isolated round with no prior information.\n\nLet me double check by thinking about expected values more formally:\nIf I play Rock and assume random play from my opponent:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: -3 points (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: +1 point (win)\nExpected value: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nIf I play Paper and assume random play from my opponent:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: +3 points (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: 0 points (tie)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: -1 point (loss)\nExpected value: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n\nIf I play Scissors and assume random play from my opponent:\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Rock: -1 point (loss)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Paper: +1 point (win)\n- 1/3 chance opponent plays Scissors: 0 points (tie)\nExpected value: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on expected value calculations against a random player, Paper has the highest expected value at +2/3. This confirms my intuition that Paper would be the best first move.\n\nSo I'll choose Paper for my first move.",

This could mean:\n1. They noticed I had figured out their pattern and changed it\n2. Their pattern is more complex than I thought\n3. They're adapting to counter my moves\n\nLet me look at this again. Maybe there's a different pattern?\n\nAfter their initial paper repeat, I thought their pattern was: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nBut actually they played: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n\nSo they didn't play scissors when expected. Let me think about what might be happening:\n\n1. Maybe they noticed I was adapting to their pattern and broke it to throw me off\n2. Perhaps they're using a more complex pattern I haven't identified yet\n3. They could be adapting to my moves rather than following a predetermined sequence\n\nFor this next round, I need to reconsider my strategy. If they truly were following a pattern and just broke it once, they might play scissors next. But if they've adapted to counter me, they might anticipate I'll play scissors (to counter what I expect to be paper) and thus play rock.\n\nGiven that I'm uncertain about their next move, I should consider the expected values:\n- If I play rock: (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n- If I play paper: (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3 points\n- If I play scissors: (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n\nBased on expected value alone, paper would be the optimal choice. However, given the opponent's history of playing paper quite frequently, scissors might actually have a higher expected value against this specific opponent.\n\nI think the safest bet is to play scissors, as it counters paper (which the opponent has played 4 times out of 10 rounds) while having a relatively small penalty (-1) if countered by rock.",

The fact that they played scissors last round could indicate:\n1. They anticipated I would play paper\n2. They might be returning to a pattern where scissors follows rock\n3. They're using some form of adaptive strategy\n\nAt this point, I need to consider what they might play next given they just played scissors:\n- They might play paper (which would follow their old pattern of scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 rock)\n- They might play rock (anticipating I'll play scissors to counter their scissors)\n- They might play scissors again (though they rarely repeat moves)\n\nGiven that they just played scissors, historically they often follow scissors with paper. Also, rock would be my optimal counter to scissors, so they might expect me to play rock and counter with paper.\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that they'll play paper next, which would be countered by scissors. However, I've played scissors several times recently with mixed results, and they might be expecting this.\n\nI'll try rock, as it:\n- Beats scissors if they repeat their last move\n- Loses to paper, but with a -3 score (which I've managed to recover from before)\n- Has a decent chance of success given their move distribution and recent choices",

It's a variation of rock-paper-scissors with different point values:\n\n- Rock beats scissors: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Paper beats rock: winner gets +3, loser gets -3 (this has higher stakes)\n- Scissors beats paper: winner gets +1, loser gets -1\n- Same moves result in a tie with no points awarded\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I don't have any information about their strategy or past moves yet. In standard rock-paper-scissors, without any additional information, each move should be equally likely to be optimal.\n\nHowever, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric. Paper beating rock has the highest stakes (+3/-3 points), while the other combinations only have +1/-1 points. This might influence strategy.\n\nLet me think about the expected value of each move:\n\nFor rock:\n- Against rock: 0 points (tie)\n- Against paper: -3 points (loss)\n- Against scissors: +1 point (win)\nIf all opponent moves are equally likely, expected value = (0 - 3 + 1)/3 = -2/3\n\nFor paper:\n- Against rock: +3 points (win)\n- Against paper: 0 points (tie)\n- Against scissors: -1 point (loss)\nIf all opponent moves are equally likely, expected value = (3 + 0 - 1)/3 = +2/3\n\nFor scissors:\n- Against rock: -1 point (loss)\n- Against paper: +1 point (win)\n- Against scissors: 0 points (tie)\nIf all opponent moves are equally likely, expected value = (-1 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, paper has the highest expected value (+2/3) if the opponent chooses moves randomly with equal probability. This is because the high payoff for paper beating rock (+3) outweighs the smaller loss when paper loses to scissors (-1).\n\nHowever, a sophisticated opponent might anticipate this and choose scissors more frequently, knowing that paper might be favored.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's strategy yet, I'll go with paper, which has the highest expected value against a random player.",

Initially, they were following a predictable pattern (paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors) which allowed me to win rounds 2 through 6. Then they adapted and won three rounds in a row (7-9) by perfectly countering my moves. But in round 10, I was able to win again with paper against rock.\n\nThe opponent might be trying to predict what I'll do based on my previous patterns.

If so, they would play scissors to counter. \n\nAlternatively, they might think I'm going to rotate my move (paper \u2192 scissors) since that was my earlier pattern, in which case they'd play rock to counter scissors.\n\nAnother possibility is that they might revert to their original pattern-based strategy since they lost the last round. If they were originally going rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper and just played rock, they might play scissors next.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I need to make a calculated decision based on expected value:\n\n- If I play paper: I win if they play rock (+3), lose if they play scissors (-1), tie if they play paper (0)\n- If I play scissors: I win if they play paper (+1), lose if they play rock (-1), tie if they play scissors (0)\n- If I play rock: I win if they play scissors (+1), lose if they play paper (-3), tie if they play rock (0)\n\nThe risk/reward ratio still seems to favor scissors as the next move. They would likely expect me to play paper again after my success, and would counter with scissors. Playing scissors myself would result in a tie. If they try to get ahead by playing rock, I would lose but only by 1 point. If they think I might switch to rock and play paper to counter, I'd win 1 point.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
