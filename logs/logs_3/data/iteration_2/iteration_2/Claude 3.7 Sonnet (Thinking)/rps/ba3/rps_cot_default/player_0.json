    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Since this is the first round and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I'll calculate the expected value of each move assuming random play from my opponent:\n   - Rock: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-3) + (1/3)(0) = -2/3\n   - Paper: (1/3)(+3) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = +2/3\n   - Scissors: (1/3)(+1) + (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(0) = 0\n\n3. Paper has the highest expected value because:\n   - It offers the highest potential gain (+3 against rock)\n   - Its potential loss (-1 against scissors) is less severe than rock's potential loss\n\n4.

Since paper-rock interactions have the highest point differential (3 points), I should consider the possibility that my opponent might try to exploit this by playing rock, anticipating I'll switch to scissors.\n\n5. If I anticipate they'll play rock, my best response is paper, which would win me 3 points.\n\n6. Additionally, paper still has the best expected value against random play.\n\n[move] paper"

Analyzing the complete game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 2-8: Multiple losses (-10 points total)\n   - Round 9-12: Four consecutive wins (+6 points total)\n   - Rounds 13-18: Five losses out of six rounds (-7 points total)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+3 points)\n   - Round 20: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 points)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 points)\n   - Round 22: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - My total score: -7 points\n\n2. Analyzing the latest development:\n   - We both played paper, resulting in a tie\n   - Their sequence before this: scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper\n   - The tie suggests they might be shifting strategies\n\n3. Anticipating opponent's next move:\n   - After a tie, players typically change their move\n   - They might expect me to play scissors (to counter their paper)\n   - If they think I'll play scissors, they would play rock\n\n4. Evaluating strategic options:\n   - If they play rock: paper wins (+3), scissors loses (-1)\n   - If they play paper again: scissors wins (+1), rock loses (-3)\n   - If they play scissors: rock wins (+1), paper loses (-1)\n\n5. Given the tie in the previous round and the likelihood they'll expect me to switch to scissors, I'll play rock to counter their anticipated scissors play.\n\n[move] rock"

Identifying recent patterns:\n   - Their recent moves: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors\n   - This looks like a classic rock-paper-scissors sequence\n   - If they continue this pattern, they would play rock next\n\n3. Analyzing my success:\n   - I've won 3 of the last 5 rounds\n   - My score has improved from -10 to -6\n   - My recent predictions of their moves have been more accurate\n\n4. Considering opponent's perspective:\n   - They might expect me to play rock again (repeating my winning move)\n   - If so, they would play paper to counter\n   - However, if they're following their sequence pattern, they'll play rock\n\n5. Given the analysis of their apparent cycle (rock \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock), and the higher reward potential, I'll play paper which would:\n   - Win against their expected rock play (+3 points)\n   - Have a manageable downside if wrong (-1 points against scissors)\n\n[move] paper"
