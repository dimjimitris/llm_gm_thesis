    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

If they're following a pattern, after rock they might play paper next.\n\n5. However, they might also anticipate that I'll switch to paper to beat their rock, and play scissors to counter.\n\n6. Considering the scoring system:\n   - Losing against paper costs me 3 points\n   - Losing against scissors costs me only 1 point\n\n7. Playing scissors is the safest move in terms of potential loss magnitude - if they play rock I only lose 1 point, if they play paper I win 1 point, and if they play scissors we tie.\n\n[move] scissors"

Let's analyze the complete pattern:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 5: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 7: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 8: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 10: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 12: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n   - Round 13: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost, -3 points)\n   - Round 16: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 17: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 19: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost, -1 point)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won, +1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won, +3 points)\n   - Round 22: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie, 0 points)\n\n2. My current total score is -4 points.\n\n3. Looking at what my opponent has done after a rock-rock tie in the past:\n   - After Round 2: They played scissors in Round 3\n   - After Round 12: They played rock again in Round 13\n\n4. My opponent has played rock more than any other move (10 times total). This suggests paper has the highest expected value statistically.\n\n5. After a tie, my opponent might expect me to change my move. If they anticipate I'll play paper (the logical counter to rock), they might play scissors.\n\n6. However, they've also shown a tendency to repeat rock moves, having played rock multiple times consecutively before.\n\n7. Given that paper has the highest potential reward (+3 points) and my need to recover from my negative score, I'll take the calculated risk with paper.\n\n[move] paper"

My current total score is -1 points. I'm getting closer to a positive score.\n\n3. After I win with paper against rock, what has my opponent done historically?\n   - After Round 7: They played scissors in Round 8\n   - After Round 16: They played scissors in Round 17\n   - After Round 21: They played rock in Round 22\n\n4. There's a pattern that after I win with paper, my opponent often plays scissors (2 out of 3 cases).\n\n5. Since I just won with paper, there's a strong chance they'll play scissors next.\n\n6. Additionally, my opponent likely anticipates I'll play paper again since it just worked for me.\n\n7. Rock would be the optimal counter to their expected scissors move.\n\n[move] rock"
