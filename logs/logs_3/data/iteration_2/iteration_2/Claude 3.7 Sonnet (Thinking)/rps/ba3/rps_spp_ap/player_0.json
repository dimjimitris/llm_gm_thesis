    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

It's an interesting variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors with asymmetric rewards:\n- Paper beating rock: +3 points (highest reward)\n- Rock beating scissors: +1 point\n- Scissors beating paper: +1 point\n- Losing with rock: -3 points (highest penalty)\n- Losing with paper or scissors: -1 point each\n- Ties: 0 points\n\nPsychological Strategist: Since this is the first move against a fresh player, we don't have any behavioral patterns to analyze yet. Often in initial games, players tend to choose Rock most frequently, as it's psychologically perceived as \"strong.\"\n\nDecision Analyst: Looking at expected values, if we assume the opponent randomly selects moves with equal probability:\n- Rock: (0 + 1 - 3)/3 = -0.67 average points\n- Paper: (0 - 1 + 3)/3 = 0.67 average points\n- Scissors: (0 + 1 - 1)/3 = 0 average points\n\nPaper has the highest expected value against a random player.\n\nGame Theorist: For a single round without history, the Nash equilibrium would be to play each move with equal probability. However, given the asymmetric rewards, we should lean slightly toward paper due to its higher potential payoff.\n\nDecision Analyst: I agree. Let's go with paper for this first move. The risk-reward ratio favors it, and it counters the psychologically common first-move rock.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

Let's analyze our options for the second round.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People often exhibit certain patterns in repeated games. One common pattern is to stick with a winning move. Since scissors won for our opponent, they might play scissors again. However, another common pattern is rotation (moving to the next option in sequence), which would suggest they might play rock next.\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's consider the opponent's reasoning. They know we might expect them to play scissors again, so they might anticipate us playing rock to counter their scissors. If they think this way, they might play paper to beat our anticipated rock.\n\nGame Theorist: We should also consider the asymmetric payoff structure. Playing rock is risky because losing to paper costs us 3 points, whereas playing paper or scissors limits our potential loss to 1 point.\n\nPsychological Strategist: Given our opponent won with scissors, I believe there's a higher probability they'll either stay with scissors (winner's bias) or expect us to play rock (to counter their scissors) and thus play paper. The least likely move from them is rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: If they play scissors again, our best counter is rock (+1). If they play paper anticipating our rock, our best counter would be scissors (+1). If they play rock (least likely), our best counter would be paper (+3).\n\nGame Theorist: Considering the probabilities and payoff structure, I recommend playing scissors. It gives us a good chance to win if they rotate to paper, and even if they stick with scissors, we just tie (0 points) rather than lose.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This suggests they might have a preference for scissors or they're employing a strategy of sticking with what worked.\n\nPsychological Strategist: The opponent's pattern so far is interesting. They stuck with scissors after winning with it, which shows consistency or possibly a \"stay with what works\" mentality. Now, they might:\n1. Continue with scissors for a third time (persistence)\n2. Anticipate that we'll play rock to counter their scissors pattern, and thus play paper\n3. Mix things up completely and play rock\n\nDecision Analyst: Based on the history so far, let's assign subjective probabilities:\n- Opponent plays scissors again: 40% (persistence)\n- Opponent plays paper: 40% (anticipating our rock)\n- Opponent plays rock: 20% (least likely)\n\nIf we play rock: We win against scissors (+1), lose against paper (-3), tie against rock (0)\nExpected value: 0.4(1) + 0.4(-3) + 0.2(0) = 0.4 - 1.2 = -0.8\n\nIf we play paper: We win against rock (+3), lose against scissors (-1), tie against paper (0)\nExpected value: 0.4(-1) + 0.4(0) + 0.2(3) = -0.4 + 0.6 = 0.2\n\nIf we play scissors: We win against paper (+1), lose against rock (-1), tie against scissors (0)\nExpected value: 0.4(0) + 0.4(1) + 0.2(-1) = 0 + 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2\n\nGame Theorist: Both paper and scissors have the same expected value in our model. However, given that the opponent has shown a preference for scissors so far, rock might actually be a stronger counter than our model suggests.\n\nPsychological Strategist: True. Many players would be reluctant to play the same move three times in a row, as it feels predictable. This might lower the actual probability of scissors below what we estimated.\n\nDecision Analyst: Given all considerations, I recommend playing rock. It directly counters the pattern we've observed, and even if the opponent anticipates this and plays paper, the overall expected outcome across all scenarios still seems favorable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

This is unusual and significant.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is fascinating! The opponent has played scissors exclusively, even after losing the last round. This suggests either:\n1. A predetermined strategy that doesn't adapt\n2. A very stubborn player\n3. A deliberate attempt to establish a pattern before breaking it\n\nAfter losing to our rock, most adaptive players would change their move. The question is: will they finally switch their strategy after losing, or continue with scissors?\n\nDecision Analyst: Let's assess our options:\n- If they continue with scissors (seems less likely now): Rock wins (+1), Paper loses (-1), Scissors ties (0)\n- If they switch to rock (anticipating we'll play rock again): Rock ties (0), Paper wins (+3), Scissors loses (-1)\n- If they switch to paper (anticipating rock): Rock loses (-3), Paper ties (0), Scissors wins (+1)\n\nGame Theorist: Given their consistent scissors play and recent loss to our rock, I believe they're most likely to switch to either rock (to tie our anticipated rock) or paper (to beat our anticipated rock). Continuing with scissors seems least likely.\n\nPsychological Strategist: People who have established a strong pattern and then lost tend to abandon that pattern. Since they've lost playing scissors against our rock, they're likely anticipating we'll play rock again. This makes paper their most logical choice to counter our expected rock.\n\nDecision Analyst: If we believe paper is their most likely play, then scissors would be our optimal response. Even if they play rock instead, our potential loss with scissors (-1) is much less than the potential loss with rock against paper (-3).\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Scissors provides a good balance of potential gain while limiting our downside risk.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent finally broke their scissors pattern and switched to paper, likely expecting us to play rock again.\n\nPsychological Strategist: This is a crucial juncture in the game. The opponent has now lost two consecutive rounds and has demonstrated they're willing to change strategy. After losing with paper against our scissors, they're now facing psychological pressure to make a winning move. \n\nThere are three main possibilities:\n1. They play rock, expecting us to play scissors again (most logical)\n2. They revert to scissors (their apparent comfort move)\n3.
