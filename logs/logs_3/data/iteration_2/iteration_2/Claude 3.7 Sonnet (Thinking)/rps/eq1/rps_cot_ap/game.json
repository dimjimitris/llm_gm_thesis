Every time after a tie, they've played scissors in the next round.\n\n4. They've recently discovered rock and played it 3 times in a row, showing commitment to this strategy.\n\n5.

They haven't played scissors in 8 rounds, making it a likely choice based on their historical patterns.\n\n7. If they play scissors, rock would be my best counter.\n\n8.

Looking at what they do after ties in general:\n   - After paper-paper ties: They consistently played scissors\n   - After rock-rock ties: They've played both rock and paper\n\n4. They haven't played scissors in 13 rounds (since Round 10), despite it being successful for them in early rounds.\n\n5. Their recent rock streak was broken when they lost with it in Round 22, then they returned to rock in Round 23.\n\n6. Given their adaptability and the fact that rock resulted in a tie, they're likely to switch to paper this round.\n\n7. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to paper after our rock tie.\n\n[move] scissors",

      "reasoning_text": "Let me analyze the game history so far and identify patterns in my opponent's behavior:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors (I lost)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 3: I played paper, opponent played paper (Tie)\nRound 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 6: I played paper, opponent played paper (Tie)\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 9: I played paper, opponent played paper (Tie)\nRound 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won)\nRound 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 13: I played rock, opponent played paper (I lost)\nRound 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\nRound 17: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\nRound 18: I played rock, opponent played rock (Tie)\nRound 19: I played rock, opponent played rock (Tie)\nRound 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won)\nRound 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost)\nRound 22: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won)\nRound 23: I played rock, opponent played rock (Tie)\n\nLooking at previous patterns after rock-rock ties:\n- After Round 18 tie (rock-rock): They played rock again in Round 19\n- After Round 19 tie (rock-rock): They played paper in Round 20\n\nAfter rock-rock ties, they've played rock once and paper once, so there's no clear pattern there.\n\nLet me check what they typically do after ties in general:\n- After Round 3 tie (paper-paper): They played scissors in Round 4\n- After Round 6 tie (paper-paper): They played scissors in Round 7\n- After Round 9 tie (paper-paper): They played scissors in Round 10\n- After Round 18 tie (rock-rock): They played rock in Round 19\n- After Round 19 tie (rock-rock): They played paper in Round 20\n\nAfter paper-paper ties, they consistently played scissors. After rock-rock ties, they've played both rock and paper.\n\nTheir overall move distribution:\n- Scissors: 5 times (Rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 10) - not played since Round 10\n- Paper: 11 times (Rounds 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20)\n- Rock: 7 times (Rounds 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23)\n\nThey've been using rock much more frequently in recent rounds, and they haven't played scissors in 13 rounds.\n\nAfter a rock-rock tie, they might:\n1. Stick with rock again (like they did after Round 18)\n2. Switch to paper (like they did after Round 19)\n3. Finally return to scissors (which they haven't played in a long time)\n\nGiven their increasing adaptability and the fact that we've had a rock-rock tie, I think they're likely to switch to paper, expecting me to play rock again.\n\nIf they play paper, scissors would be my best counter.",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
