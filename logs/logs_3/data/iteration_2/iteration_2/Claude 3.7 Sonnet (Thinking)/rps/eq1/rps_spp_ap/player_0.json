    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Without prior information about the opponent's tendencies, no move has a theoretical advantage.\n\nPsychology Expert: First-time players often choose Rock as their initial move since it's psychologically perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" Studies suggest approximately 35-40% of people choose Rock first, compared to about 35% for Paper and 25-30% for Scissors.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given the psychological tendency for new players to favor Rock, playing Paper as our first move would give us a slight statistical edge. However, we should be prepared to adjust our strategy based on the opponent's first move.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. While pure game theory would suggest a random choice, the psychological insight gives us a small edge. Let's go with Paper for the first move.\n\nPsychology Expert: One additional point - if our opponent has any game theory knowledge, they might anticipate us choosing Paper to counter the common Rock first move, and choose Scissors instead. However, this level of meta-reasoning is less common in fresh players.\n\n[move] paper"

Our opponent chose Rock as predicted for a first-time player. Now we need to consider how they'll adapt after losing. Most players tend to switch moves after losing, with a psychological tendency to believe \"what beat me will work for me\" - so they may switch to Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a valid point. We should consider the psychological dynamics of loss aversion. Having lost with Rock, the opponent will likely change their strategy. The most natural progression would be to Paper (what beat them), though some might jump to Scissors thinking we'll repeat Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: Let's analyze the possibilities:\n1. If opponent switches to Paper (most likely after losing to Paper): we should play Scissors\n2. If opponent switches to Scissors (anticipating we'll repeat Paper): we should play Rock\n3. If opponent stubbornly repeats Rock (less likely): Paper would win again\n\nPsychology Expert: Given that this appears to be a novice player who followed the typical \"Rock first\" pattern, I believe they're most likely to switch to Paper, trying to copy what beat them.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The most probable move from the opponent is Paper, so Scissors gives us the best chance to win this round.\n\n[move] scissors"

Our opponent didn't choose Paper as predicted, but instead matched our Scissors move. This suggests they might be thinking at least one step ahead. After a tie, players often follow certain patterns:\n1) They might stick with the same move (Scissors again)\n2) They might shift to what would beat their previous move (Rock)\n3) They might complete the \"cycle\" since they've played Rock then Scissors, but not Paper yet\n\nGame Theorist: After a tie, there's no clear winner's strategy to copy. The opponent has now played Rock then Scissors, showing they're willing to change moves. Given they've played two of the three possible moves, they might complete the cycle with Paper, or they might return to Rock thinking we wouldn't expect it.\n\nStrategic Planner: Looking at the pattern so far:\n- Round 1: They played Rock (lost)\n- Round 2: They played Scissors (tied)\nI think it's most likely they'll play Rock again, as it beats the Scissors both players just used. This \"beat the previous move\" strategy is common.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The most probable move is Rock, so we should counter with Paper.\n\n[move] paper"

The opponent has found success with Scissors and is showing reinforcement behavior - sticking with what's working. Many players will continue using a successful move until it loses. The fact that they used Scissors twice in a row, with the second time resulting in a win, strongly suggests they'll use Scissors a third time.\n\nStrategic Planner: Given this pattern, our best counter to expected Scissors would be Rock. However, if the opponent is thinking one step ahead, they might anticipate this and switch to Paper. But the psychological tendency to stick with winning moves is strong.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with the assessment.

Now they've lost with Scissors against our Rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: This is a critical juncture. After losing with a move they've repeatedly used, players typically abandon that strategy. The psychological tendency would be to switch to what beat them (Rock) or to complete the cycle with Paper. Given their heavy reliance on Scissors so far, I think they're more likely to switch to Rock than Paper.\n\nStrategic Planner: I agree. After three consecutive Scissors moves ending in a loss, they're highly likely to switch to Rock. The \"use what beat me\" psychology is particularly strong after a string of the same move has been broken by a loss.\n\nGame Theorist: If they switch to Rock as predicted, our optimal counter would be Paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: The psychological pressure to change moves is substantial now. Their commitment to Scissors has been punished, and Rock would feel like the \"strong\" move to recover with.\n\n[move] paper"

Their behavior follows an unusual pattern - they stick with moves far beyond what typical game theory would predict, even in the face of repeated losses. They played Scissors 6 times before switching, and now they've played Paper 5 times despite losing three times in a row.\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on their previous pattern (switching after 6 Scissors rounds), they might continue with Paper for one more round before switching. However, the three consecutive losses might accelerate their switch. If they do switch, they would most likely move to Rock next.\n\nGame Theorist: Given their demonstrated extreme persistence, the most likely scenario is that they'll play Paper again. However, the probability they'll switch increases with each consecutive loss.\n\nStrategic Planner: Our safest play is to use Scissors again, as it has the highest probability of success given their established pattern.\n\n[move] scissors"

Now they've played Paper for exactly 6 rounds.\n\nStrategic Planner: Based on this higher-level pattern, they are highly likely to switch moves now.

Breaking an established pattern often happens when a player realizes their opponent has figured them out.\n\nStrategic Planner: With this disruption in their pattern, we need to recalibrate.
