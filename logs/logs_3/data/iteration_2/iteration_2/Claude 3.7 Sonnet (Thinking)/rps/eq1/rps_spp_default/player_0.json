    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me collaborate with some helpful personas to determine the best approach.\n\nPersonas: Game Theorist, Psychological Analyst, Strategic Coach\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theorist: In a one-shot game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a fresh opponent, each move has an equal 1/3 probability of winning, losing, or tying. From a pure game theory perspective, the optimal strategy is to randomize your choice uniformly among the three options.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Studies show that in the first round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, many players tend to choose Rock as their initial move. This is because Rock is perceived as \"strong\" or \"stable.\" If we assume the opponent follows this tendency, Paper would be the optimal counter.\n\nStrategic Coach: Since this is the first move against a new player, we don't have any pattern data to work with. While the Game Theorist suggests randomization as the mathematically sound approach, the psychological insight gives us a slight edge. I'd recommend going with Paper for this first move, but be prepared to adapt our strategy as we learn more about the opponent's patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree that Paper is a reasonable first move based on psychological factors. Just be aware that sophisticated players might anticipate this and choose Scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Analyst: True. If you sense your opponent might be more experienced or strategic, then randomization would be safer.\n\nStrategic Coach: Let's go with Paper for this first round, as it gives us a slight advantage against typical first-move behavior.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

After losing a round, players often change their strategy rather than repeating the same move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Exactly. After losing with Rock against Paper, the opponent has two likely responses: they might anticipate us playing Paper again and counter with Scissors, or they might switch to Paper themselves assuming we'll play Rock.\n\nStrategic Coach: The opponent now knows we played Paper in the first round. Common psychology suggests they'll expect us to either stick with our winning move (Paper) or move one step ahead in the cycle to Scissors. If they think we'll stay with Paper, they'll play Scissors. If they think we'll \"advance\" to Scissors, they'll play Rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Studies show that after losing, players often switch to the move that would have beaten their previous choice. So there's a good chance the opponent will switch to Paper (which would have beaten their Rock).\n\nGame Theorist: Given these considerations, playing Rock would be effective against an opponent who switches to Scissors, while playing Scissors would be effective against an opponent who switches to Paper.\n\nStrategic Coach: I think Scissors is the stronger play here. It covers the psychological tendency of the opponent switching to the move that would have won the previous round (Paper), and it also advances our own strategy in a natural progression, making us less predictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

This suggests they may be using a pattern or responding to our moves.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, players often try to \"win\" the previous tie by choosing the move that would beat what was just played. Since both players used Scissors, the opponent may now choose Rock (which beats Scissors).\n\nStrategic Coach: I agree. The psychological tendency after a tie is often to switch to the move that would have won that tie. Additionally, we can see the opponent is not simply rotating through the three options sequentially, as they went from Rock to Scissors, skipping Paper. This suggests they're making deliberate choices based on our play or some strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: If we believe they'll choose Rock to beat our previous Scissors move, then our optimal response would be Paper.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's also a possibility that the opponent noticed our progression from Paper to Scissors and might expect us to complete the cycle with Rock. In that case, they might choose Paper to counter.\n\nStrategic Coach: Considering all factors, Paper seems to be the stronger move here. It beats Rock (which we predict they might play to beat our previous Scissors), and it also represents an unexpected break in our own pattern if they're tracking that.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

This could indicate they're cycling through the options sequentially.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The pattern suggests they might be using a simple rotation strategy. If they continue this pattern, they would play Rock next. It's also possible that after two consecutive ties, they might try to break the pattern deliberately.\n\nStrategic Coach: If they are following a rotation of Rock \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Rock, then their next move would likely be Rock. To counter this, we should play Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: However, we should consider that they might anticipate our analysis and break their own pattern. After two ties, there's psychological pressure to win the next round.\n\nPsychological Analyst: True. There's another possibility - they might observe that we've played Paper twice already (in rounds 1 and 3) and assume we favor that move. If so, they might play Scissors to counter our perceived preference.\n\nStrategic Coach: Let's weigh our options:\n1. If they play Rock (continuing their rotation): Paper wins\n2. If they play Scissors (to counter our Paper usage): Rock wins\n3. If they play Paper (breaking their pattern): Scissors wins\n\nGiven the strongest evidence points to them playing Rock next (following their rotation), and the second most likely is Scissors (to counter our Paper preference), I recommend playing Rock. It beats their potential Scissors play and would only tie if they break their rotation pattern with Rock.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree with this analysis.

However, if the opponent is truly following a fixed rotation, they'll play Scissors next regardless of this pressure.\n\nStrategic Coach: If they maintain their rotation pattern, they'll play Scissors in this round. The optimal counter to Scissors is Rock. Given the strong evidence for their rotational strategy, I recommend playing Rock again.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. The data strongly suggests they'll play Scissors next. Playing Rock gives us the highest probability of winning this round.\n\nPsychological Analyst: There's always the possibility they might break their pattern after recognizing we've figured it out, but the evidence for the rotation is strong enough that Rock remains our best strategic choice.\n\nStrategic Coach: Let's go with Rock again.

After we won in round 8, the opponent completely shifted their strategy - they played Rock instead of the expected Paper. They might be using a counter-strategy to what they think we'll play rather than following their own pattern.\n\nStrategic Coach: The pattern of the opponent's moves in the last 5 rounds is Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock. There's a repetition of Paper-Scissors, but then they broke it with Rock. After losing twice, they may be becoming more unpredictable.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at win-loss psychology, after winning with Rock against us, they might stick with that winning move (Rock). Alternatively, they might anticipate that we'll play Paper to counter their Rock, and thus play Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a player wins, they often either repeat their winning move or advance one step in the cycle, expecting their opponent to counter their previous move. So the opponent might stick with Rock or switch to Paper.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given these considerations, I think Paper is our best move. If they repeat Rock (which winners often do), we win. If they switch to Paper anticipating our Rock counter, we tie. If they play Scissors anticipating our Paper counter to their Rock, we lose. But the psychological tendency to repeat winning moves makes Rock their most likely choice.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Paper gives us the best expected value in this situation.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Paper"

This suggests the opponent might be using a similar decision process to ours or has some way of predicting our moves.\n\nStrategic Coach: Looking at the patterns after ties with Paper (rounds 3 and 7), the opponent followed up with Rock and Paper respectively. There's no clear pattern there, but after a tie, players often try to beat what was just played - in this case, they might play Scissors to beat our Paper.\n\nGame Theorist: It's worth noting that the opponent's last four moves were Paper \u2192 Scissors \u2192 Rock \u2192 Paper. This could suggest they're trying different approaches or using a complex pattern.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After a tie, especially repeated ties with the same move, there's strong pressure to switch to a move that would win against the previous move. The opponent might play Scissors now to beat our Paper.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given the analysis, I believe Rock would be our strongest play. It counters the most likely response from the opponent (Scissors) following a Paper tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree.

We need to break this pattern. Given their history, there's a high chance they'll play Paper after our Rock tie.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If we look at what happened after the previous Rock-Rock tie (Round 4), they played Paper in the next round. If this pattern holds, Scissors would be our optimal move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: It's also worth noting that after repeated ties, there's psychological pressure to \"win\" against the last move played. Since both players used Rock, many players would switch to Paper.\n\nStrategic Coach: All evidence points to Scissors being our best play here.

The psychological tendency after losing is to switch to what would have won against your previous move. Looking at the opponent's history after losses:\n- In Round 9, after losing to our Rock with their Scissors, they played Rock.\nThis suggests they don't always follow the typical pattern, but the psychological pressure to switch to Rock after losing with Paper is still strong.\n\nGame Theorist: If they play Rock as we expect, our best counter would be Paper. However, we should also consider that they might anticipate this analysis and play Scissors instead.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Given that we've accurately predicted their last move, they might become aware that their patterns are being read. This could lead them to deliberately break their pattern.

We won.\n- Round 17: We played Scissors, opponent played Paper. We won.\n- Round 18: We played Paper, opponent played Scissors. We lost.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Our winning streak has been broken! The opponent finally adapted their strategy. Instead of playing Rock after losing with Paper (as they had done before), they played Scissors - likely anticipating that we would expect Rock and counter with Paper (which we did).\n\nStrategic Coach: The opponent has become more sophisticated and broken their pattern. After six consecutive losses, they finally switched strategies to counter our predictive approach.\n\nGame Theorist: After winning with Scissors, the opponent has several likely options:\n1. Repeat their winning move (Scissors) due to \"winner stays\" psychology\n2. Anticipate that we'll play Rock to counter their Scissors, and thus play Paper\n3. Play something completely unexpected to continue breaking patterns\n\nPsychological Analyst: Winners often experience confidence and tend to either repeat their winning move or advance one step ahead in their thinking. Given that they just had success breaking a pattern, they might try to anticipate our next move.\n\nStrategic Coach: I believe Rock is our strongest play here. It beats Scissors if they repeat their winning move (which is psychologically common), and it protects us against the most likely scenario based on winner psychology.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock gives us the best chance against their most likely strategies after finally breaking their losing streak.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

We lost.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has completely adapted and is now on a 2-game winning streak. They've broken their pattern and appear to be either anticipating our moves or developing a new strategy. After winning with Scissors in Round 18, they played Paper in Round 19, advancing one step in the RPS cycle.\n\nStrategic Coach: Their recent moves are telling. They've gone from Scissors to Paper, advancing in the cycle. If they continue this progression, they'll play Scissors next. Moreover, they seem to be anticipating our strategy - they correctly predicted we would play Rock after losing to Scissors.\n\nGame Theorist: Looking at their winning pattern in the last two rounds:\n- They won with Scissors (R18) then played Paper (R19)\nIf they follow the same pattern, after winning with Paper they might play Scissors next.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Winners often develop confidence in their strategy. They might continue their progression through the RPS cycle (Paper \u2192 Scissors) or anticipate that we'll try to counter their Paper with Scissors and thus play Rock.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given the opponent's adaptation and apparent anticipation of our moves, I recommend playing Rock. It counters the Scissors they might play next following their cyclic pattern, and breaks our own predictability.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. Rock gives us the best chance against their most likely Scissors move, based on their recent winning pattern.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

Looking at previous Rock-Rock ties in our history:\n- After the Rock-Rock tie in Round 4, they played Paper in Round 5.\n- After the Rock-Rock tie in Round 11, they played Paper in Round 12.\nThis suggests a strong pattern where they follow Rock-Rock ties with Paper.\n\nStrategic Coach: The historical pattern is clear - after Rock-Rock ties, they've consistently played Paper. Additionally, they were on a winning streak before this tie, which may make them eager to resume winning by following their previously successful patterns.\n\nGame Theorist: If they follow their historical pattern after Rock-Rock ties, they'll play Paper next. Our optimal counter would be Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The tie has reset some of the psychological momentum of their winning streak, and they may revert to established patterns. The evidence strongly suggests they'll play Paper after a Rock tie.\n\nStrategic Coach: I recommend playing Scissors for this round. It counters their likely Paper move based on their consistent historical behavior after Rock-Rock ties.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Scissors"

We lost.\n- Round 20: We played Rock, opponent played Rock. Tie.\n- Round 21: We played Scissors, opponent played Rock. We lost.\n\nPsychological Analyst: The opponent has completely broken their previous patterns and is now on a 3-game unbeaten streak (2 wins, 1 tie). After tying with Rock, they didn't play Paper as they had done in previous rounds - instead, they played Rock again. This suggests they're now deliberately avoiding their own patterns.\n\nStrategic Coach: They seem to have adapted to our strategy of pattern recognition. Their recent sequence (Paper \u2192 Rock \u2192 Rock) doesn't follow any clear pattern from their earlier play. After winning with Rock, they might:\n1. Repeat Rock again since it's been successful twice in a row\n2. Expect us to play Paper to counter their Rock, and thus play Scissors\n3. Advance to Paper in a new pattern\n\nGame Theorist: Given that they've used Rock twice in a row, statistically they're less likely to play Rock a third time. Since they've been successful in breaking patterns, they're likely thinking ahead to counter our next move.\n\nPsychological Analyst: After consecutive wins, players gain confidence and often try to anticipate their opponent's adaptation. Since they've won with Rock against our Scissors, they might expect us to play Paper next (to beat their Rock), and thus play Scissors to counter that.\n\nStrategic Coach: I recommend playing Rock for this round. It protects against their potential Scissors play and breaks our own recent pattern of Rock \u2192 Rock \u2192 Scissors, making us less predictable.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\n[move] Rock"

We won.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Our prediction was correct! The opponent did play Scissors as we anticipated. Looking at the opponent's behavior after losses throughout the game, they often play what would have beaten their previous move. Since they just lost with Scissors, they would likely play Paper next (which would have beaten their Scissors).\n\nStrategic Coach: Their behavior after losses has been somewhat consistent:\n- After losing with Paper in Round 17, they played Scissors in Round 18\n- After losing with Scissors in Round 14, they played Paper in Round 15\n- After losing with Rock in Round 16, they played Paper in Round 17\n\nGame Theorist: Based on these patterns, there's a strong likelihood they'll play Paper next. Our optimal counter would be Scissors.\n\nPsychological Analyst: Also worth noting is that we've now broken their winning momentum. After a loss, players often revert to more basic strategies rather than trying to out-think their opponent.\n\nStrategic Coach: I recommend playing Scissors for this round.

The most common response is Scissors.\n\nStrategic Coach: Given their historical tendencies after losing with Paper, they're most likely to play Scissors next. Our optimal counter to Scissors would be Rock.\n\nPsychological Analyst: They've also lost their momentum now, having lost two rounds in a row. This often leads players to revert to more basic or familiar strategies, making them more predictable.\n\nStrategic Coach: I recommend playing Rock for this round.
