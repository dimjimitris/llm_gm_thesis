    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Let me review the game history:\n   - Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 2: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 3: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 4: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 6: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 8: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 9: I played paper, opponent played paper \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 10: I played rock, opponent played scissors \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 11: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 12: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 13: I played rock, opponent played paper \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 14: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 15: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 16: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n   - Round 17: I played paper, opponent played rock \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 18: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 19: I played rock, opponent played rock \u2192 Tie (0 points)\n   - Round 20: I played scissors, opponent played paper \u2192 I won (+1 point)\n   - Round 21: I played scissors, opponent played rock \u2192 I lost (-1 point)\n\n2. My opponent has switched back to rock and won with it.\n\n3. Looking at their behavior after winning:\n   - After winning with scissors in Round 1, they played scissors again in Round 2\n   - After winning with paper in Round 13, they played paper again in Round 14\n   - After winning with rock in Round 16, they played rock again in Round 17\n\n4. They tend to stick with a winning move, so there's a good chance they'll play rock again.\n\n5. If they play rock again, my best counter would be paper.\n\n6. They've been becoming more adaptive in their strategy recently, switching between rock and paper.\n\n7. Given their pattern of sticking with winning moves, they're most likely to play rock again.\n\n8. I'll play paper to counter their anticipated rock move.\n\n[move] paper"

My opponent just lost with rock against my paper.\n\n3. Looking at their recent adaptability and their overall move distribution:\n   - They haven't played scissors in 12 rounds (since Round 10)\n   - They've been alternating between rock and paper recently\n   - After losses, they've been changing their strategy more frequently\n\n4. After a loss, they tend to switch to a different move rather than stick with the losing one.\n\n5. Since they haven't played scissors in so long, it might be time for them to return to it.\n\n6. If they switch to scissors, my best counter would be rock.\n\n7. There's a smaller chance they'll return to paper (their most historically common move).\n\n8. I'll play rock, anticipating they'll switch to scissors after their rock loss.\n\n[move] rock"

Looking at previous rock-rock ties:\n   - After Round 18 tie: They played rock again in Round 19\n   - After Round 19 tie: They played paper in Round 20\n\n3. Looking at what they do after ties in general:\n   - After paper-paper ties: They consistently played scissors\n   - After rock-rock ties: They've played both rock and paper\n\n4. They haven't played scissors in 13 rounds (since Round 10), despite it being successful for them in early rounds.\n\n5. Their recent rock streak was broken when they lost with it in Round 22, then they returned to rock in Round 23.\n\n6. Given their adaptability and the fact that rock resulted in a tie, they're likely to switch to paper this round.\n\n7. If they play paper, scissors would be my best counter.\n\n8. I'll play scissors, anticipating they'll switch to paper after our rock tie.\n\n[move] scissors"
