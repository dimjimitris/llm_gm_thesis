Pattern recognition - trying to detect patterns in the opponent's moves\n3. Psychology - predicting what the opponent might do based on previous moves\n\nSince I only have one data point, I can't really detect a pattern yet. However, I can apply some basic psychology:\n- Opponents often don't repeat the same move after losing\n- After losing to paper, the opponent might switch to scissors to counter paper\n- If they think I'm going to use paper again, they would use scissors\n\nBased on this reasoning, I think the opponent might switch to scissors. To counter scissors, I should use rock.\n\nI'll go with rock for this round.",

They played rock in rounds 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 (4 out of the last 6 rounds).\n\nGiven this pattern, paper would be a good strategic choice again as it beats rock. Since the opponent has played rock in the last round, there's a chance they might continue with this move or switch to counter my previous paper move with scissors.\n\nHowever, if they're adapting to my strategy, they might anticipate that I'll play paper again and switch to scissors. In that case, rock would be the best counter.\n\nI'll go with rock for this round as it seems the opponent may be adapting to counter my previous paper moves.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
