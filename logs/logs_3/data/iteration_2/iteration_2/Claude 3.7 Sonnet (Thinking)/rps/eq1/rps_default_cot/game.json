The opponent's move sequence has been: rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock\n\n3. I correctly predicted their rock move in round 7, which suggests they may be returning to earlier patterns.\n\n4. They began with a rock-scissors-rock-scissors pattern, then deviated, and now have played rock again.\n\n5. If they're returning to their alternating pattern, they would play scissors next.\n\n6. They might also anticipate I'll play paper again (since it just won) and play scissors to counter.\n\n7. Based on their historical preference for scissors (played 3/7 rounds) and potential return to alternating pattern, rock seems the optimal move.\n\n[move] rock"

Paper: Beats rock, loses to scissors\n3. Scissors: Beats paper, loses to rock\n\nSince I have no prior data on my opponent, and this is the first move, I could:\n- Choose randomly (which would be optimal against a perfectly rational opponent)\n- Try to guess based on common human tendencies\n\nSome studies suggest that rock is the most common first move people make in Rock, Paper, Scissors, possibly because rock has psychological connotations of strength and stability. If that's true, then paper would be a good first move.\n\nHowever, if my opponent anticipates this and plays scissors expecting me to play paper, then I should play rock.\n\nThis is a recursive reasoning problem that has no definitive solution without data on my opponent's tendencies.\n\nFor my first move, I'll go with paper as a strategic choice. Paper beats the commonly chosen first move (rock), and this gives me a reasonable chance of winning the first round.",

In such a state, they might try something completely different or revert to more instinctive play.\n\nThey've just lost with scissors against my rock. Looking at their pattern, they seem to have fallen into a somewhat predictable pattern recently, alternating between paper and rock, then falling back to scissors.\n\nGiven the psychological state of someone who has lost many consecutive rounds:\n1. They might try to counter what just beat them (my rock) by playing paper\n2. They might try to completely break their pattern and do something unexpected\n3. They might overthink and try to anticipate my next move\n\nSince I've correctly predicted their moves six times in a row, they're likely aware that their strategy is being read. This might push them to break their pattern.\n\nI think the most likely move for them now is paper - to counter my rock from the previous round. They've lost with scissors twice in the last few rounds, so they'll likely avoid that.\n\nTo counter their anticipated paper move, scissors would be my best choice.",
