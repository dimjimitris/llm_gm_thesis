Ties award no points.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player, I have no information about their strategy or tendencies. Rock-Paper-Scissors is generally a game of chance when played against a random opponent, but I can try to think strategically.\n\nSome general RPS strategy thoughts:\n1. Rock is often the most common opening move for novice players\n2. Given that, Paper would be a reasonable counter for a first move\n3. However, some players might anticipate this and go with Scissors\n4. The optimal strategy in repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors with a rational opponent is to play each option with equal probability (1/3)\n\nSince I have no information about my opponent, I'll go with Paper for my first move.

According to the rules I was given:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nBut the outcome described says that I won with paper against scissors. According to the rules I was given, scissors should beat paper, not the other way around. \n\nLet me double-check the rules:\n1. Paper beats scissors - winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n2. Rock beats paper - winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n3. Scissors beats rock - winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nThis seems like a non-standard Rock, Paper, Scissors ruleset. In the standard game:\n- Rock beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Paper\n- Paper beats Rock\n\nIn the ruleset I was given:\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nThis is a cyclical relationship but different from the standard game. Given this ruleset, I should continue playing according to these rules.\n\nSince I won with Paper against Scissors in the last round, my opponent might avoid Scissors this time. They might go with Rock (which beats Paper according to these rules) or they might try Paper themselves for a tie.\n\nLet me think strategically:\n- If I play Paper and they play Paper: Tie (0 points)\n- If I play Paper and they play Rock: Loss (-1 points)\n- If I play Paper and they play Scissors: Win (1 point)\n\n- If I play Rock and they play Paper: Win (1 point)\n- If I play Rock and they play Rock: Tie (0 points)\n- If I play Rock and they play Scissors: Loss (-1 points)\n\n- If I play Scissors and they play Paper: Loss (-1 points)\n- If I play Scissors and they play Rock: Win (1 point)\n- If I play Scissors and they play Scissors: Tie (0 points)\n\nSince I just won with Paper, my opponent might expect me to play Paper again. To counter that, they might play Rock. To counter their potential Rock play, I could play Scissors.\n\nBut they might also expect me to change my strategy, in which case they might play Scissors expecting me to play Rock. In that case, my best move would be Paper.\n\nThis is a complex mind game! I think I'll go with Rock this time, as it could be effective if my opponent anticipates me sticking with Paper and plays Scissors to counter.",

According to the rules:\n- paper beats rock (not scissors)\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nSo if I played paper and my opponent played scissors, I should have lost. There seems to be a discrepancy between the game rules and the outcome reported. Let me double-check the rules:\n\nFrom the description:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, these rules are different from the standard rock-paper-scissors. In this version:\n- paper beats scissors\n- rock beats paper\n- scissors beats rock\n\nIt's the opposite of the standard game! Let me use this understanding going forward.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played rock\n- Opponent played rock\n- It was a tie, 0 points\n\nFor Round 3, I need to consider what my opponent might do. They might anticipate that I'll play scissors (to beat their rock), so they might play paper to beat my scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat their paper.\n\nBut they might also think I'll continue with rock, in which case they might play scissors. In that case, I should play paper.\n\nGiven these conflicting predictions, I'll go with scissors because:\n1. If they play rock again, I'll win\n2. If they switch to paper expecting my rock, we'll tie\n3. If they switch to scissors expecting my paper, I'll lose\n\nThe probability seems slightly better for scissors in this case.",

In Rock-Paper-Scissors, there's no dominant strategy if both players are playing optimally - the optimal play is to randomly choose each option with equal probability (1/3 for each).\n\nHowever, if my opponent has patterns or tendencies, I could try to exploit them. From the limited data, my opponent has played scissors twice and rock once. They might have a preference for scissors.\n\nIf they favor scissors, I should play rock.

Given that we've had several ties in a row, my opponent might be trying to predict my next move. I've played the sequence: paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock. If my opponent notices this pattern, they might expect me to play scissors next.\n\nSo I could either:\n1. Continue the pattern and play scissors\n2. Break the pattern and play something else to surprise them\n\nLet's break the pattern and play paper.",

It seems like the opponent is mimicking my previous move.

Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, I may have misread the results. Let me check the actual outcomes again:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I WON. (+1 point)\nWait, paper doesn't beat scissors. Scissors beats paper. So if I played paper and the opponent played scissors, I should have LOST, not won.\n\nLet me re-read the rules to make sure I understand them correctly:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nOk, I think I misunderstood the rules. Let me try again with the correct understanding:\n\n- paper beats rock\n- rock beats scissors\n- scissors beats paper\n\nSo with this understanding:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won correctly)\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie correctly)\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie correctly)\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie correctly)\nRound 5: I played rock, opponent played rock (tie correctly)\nRound 6: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie correctly)\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won correctly)\n\nActually, I see they reported Round 1 as: \"You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: scissors.\" So I should have lost according to the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. And for Round 7, they reported: \"You made the move: rock. Your opponent made the move: paper.\" So I should have lost again according to standard rules.\n\nLet me re-check how the game's rules are defined in the prompt:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nThese rules are the exact opposite of the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. So under these inverted rules:\n\nRound 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I won. (+1 point) - Correct per inverted rules\nRound 7: I played rock, opponent played paper. I won. (+1 point) - Correct per inverted rules\n\nGiven these inverted rules, I should play:\n- Paper to beat Scissors\n- Rock to beat Paper\n- Scissors to beat Rock\n\nNow, I need to analyze if there's a pattern in the opponent's play:\n\nRound 1: I played paper \u2192 Round 2: Opponent played rock\nRound 2: I played rock \u2192 Round 3: Opponent played scissors\nRound 3: I played scissors \u2192 Round 4: Opponent played paper\nRound 4: I played paper \u2192 Round 5: Opponent played rock\nRound 5: I played rock \u2192 Round 6: Opponent played scissors\nRound 6: I played scissors \u2192 Round 7: Opponent played paper\n\nI see a pattern! The opponent seems to be playing the move that would beat my previous move in the standard game (or the move that would lose to my previous move in this inverted game).\n\nSo if I played rock in Round 7, I predict the opponent will play scissors in Round 8 (the move that would beat rock in the standard game).\n\nGiven the inverted rules, scissors beats rock. So if the opponent plays scissors, I should play paper to beat their scissors.\n\nSo for Round 8, I'll play paper.",

In rounds where I won, there seems to be a contradiction in the game rules. Let me revisit them:\n\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, this is actually completely wrong. The correct rules should be:\n- scissors beats paper\n- rock beats scissors\n- paper beats rock\n\nBut according to the results I'm seeing:\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (round 1)\n- I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (round 7)\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (round 8)\n- I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (round 9)\n- I played rock, opponent played paper, I won (round 13)\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won (round 14)\n- I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won (round 15)\n\nIt seems like the rules have been reversed for this game, or there's something else unusual happening. In traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nBut here, it looks like:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nGiven this pattern, I should continue playing with these reversed rules in mind. For my next move, I'll choose scissors.",

It appears they're repeating a sequence of moves:\n- When I play rock, they play either rock or paper\n- When I play paper, they play either paper or scissors\n- When I play scissors, they play either scissors or rock\n\nIn fact, looking at rounds 7-9, 13-15, and 19, when I win it's because:\n- I play rock, they play paper\n- I play paper, they play scissors\n- I play scissors, they play rock\n\nThis is very interesting because it means they're making moves that would normally counter my previous move. For example, if I played paper in one round, they play scissors in the next (which would beat paper).\n\nFor the next move, if this pattern continues, I should play paper, and they will likely play scissors.",
