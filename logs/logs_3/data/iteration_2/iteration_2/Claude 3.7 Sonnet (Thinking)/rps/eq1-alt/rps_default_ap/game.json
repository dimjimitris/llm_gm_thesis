There seems to be a contradiction here. The rules state:\n  - paper beats scissors\n  - rock beats paper\n  - scissors beats rock\n\nBut the hint says I played scissors, opponent played rock, and I won. This is inconsistent with the rules provided. Let me double-check...\n\nAccording to the rules provided initially:\n- paper beats scissors (paper winner, scissors loser)\n- rock beats paper (rock winner, paper loser)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors winner, rock loser)\n\nSo scissors does beat rock according to the rules. The rules are just different from the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game. In this variant:\n- Rock beats Paper\n- Paper beats Scissors\n- Scissors beats Rock\n\nSo my win in round 3 makes sense according to these rules.\n\nFor my next move, I need to think strategically. My opponent seems to be potentially using a pattern where they played Paper, then Rock, then Rock again. I could try to anticipate their next move based on this.\n\nIf they're going through a pattern, they might play Scissors next. If I want to beat Scissors, I should play Paper.\n\nAlternatively, they might notice I've gone Paper-Rock-Scissors in order and try to counter my next logical move (which would be Paper again to complete the cycle). If they think I'll play Paper, they might play Rock to beat it, in which case I should play Scissors.\n\nGiven that they played Rock twice in a row, they might stick with Rock again, in which case Scissors would be my best move.\n\nI think I'll go with Paper for this round, as it would beat them if they switch to Scissors, and would tie if they repeat Paper.",

I won (+1).\nRound 20: I played Paper, opponent played Scissors. I won (+1).\n\nWait, this is very confusing. The results don't match what I would expect from the payoff matrix:\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for paper, -1 for scissors\n- Rock beats paper: +1 for rock, -1 for paper\n- Scissors beats rock: +1 for scissors, -1 for rock\n\nBut in the results I'm seeing:\n- When I play Scissors and opponent plays Rock, I win\n- When I play Paper and opponent plays Rock, I lose\n- When I play Rock and opponent plays Paper, I win\n- When I play Scissors and opponent plays Paper, I lose\n- When I play Rock and opponent plays Scissors, I lose\n- When I play Paper and opponent plays Scissors, I win\n\nThis is exactly the reverse of what the initial rules state!\n\nLet me double-check by comparing to the original rules:\n- paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors)\n- rock beats paper (+1 for rock, -1 for paper)\n- scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock)\n\nBut what I'm observing is:\n- scissors beats rock (+1 for scissors, -1 for rock) - matches\n- rock beats paper (+1 for rock, -1 for paper) - matches\n- paper beats scissors (+1 for paper, -1 for scissors) - matches\n\nWait, I think I misread the rules earlier. Let me check the rules again:\n\nPaper beats scissors: This should be scissors beats paper\nRock beats paper: This matches\nScissors beats rock: This should be rock beats scissors\n\nSo the actual rules seem to be:\n- scissors beats paper (+1 for scissors, -1 for paper)\n- rock beats paper (+1 for rock, -1 for paper)\n- rock beats scissors (+1 for rock, -1 for scissors)\n\nThat would create a proper rock-paper-scissors game with rock > scissors > paper > rock.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't match the results either.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. Let me re-read the rules from the beginning:\n\n\"There are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nOh, I see the problem. The rules as written are inconsistent with the traditional game. They say:\n- paper beats scissors (normally scissors beats paper)\n- rock beats paper (this is standard)\n- scissors beats rock (normally rock beats scissors)\n\nThis creates a cycle where every option can beat every other option, which is not how the game normally works.\n\nBut based on the results I've been getting, it seems the game is actually implementing:\n- scissors beats paper\n- rock beats scissors\n- paper beats rock\n\nWhich is the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors game.\n\nLet me go with this assumption and continue playing. Looking at the recent pattern:\n- I've won the last 3 rounds by playing Paper when the opponent played Scissors\n- Before that, I lost by playing Rock against Scissors\n- Before that, I won 4 times by playing Rock against Paper\n\nIt seems the opponent might be rotating through a pattern, or responding to my moves in some way. Since Paper has been winning recently, I'll stick with it.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
