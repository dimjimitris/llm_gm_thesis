    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

However, many new players tend to choose Rock as their opening move, as it feels \"strong.\"\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: That's correct. Statistical analysis of first-time players shows Rock is chosen approximately 35-40% of the time as an opening move. If we assume our opponent might follow this tendency, Paper would be a strategic counter.\n\nProbabilistic Thinker: While randomization is optimal long-term, exploiting the first-move bias toward Rock gives us a slight edge. Paper has a statistical advantage in opening moves against inexperienced players.\n\nGame Theorist: Let's go with Paper for this first move, then adjust our strategy based on the opponent's response pattern.\n\n[move] Paper"

The opponent also chose Paper for the first move. After a tie, players often shift to a new move rather than repeating the same one. Many follow a psychological pattern of \"cycling\" to the move that would beat their previous choice - which would mean our opponent might play Scissors next.\n\nGame Theorist: I agree. If they're thinking strategically, they might assume we'll play Paper again and counter with Scissors. Or they might try to get inside our heads and anticipate our switch.\n\nPattern Recognition Expert: With only one data point, we can't establish a definitive pattern yet, but the psychological tendency to shift after a tie is worth considering. If they're likely to play Scissors next, our best counter would be Rock.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: Rock is a good choice here - it protects against the most probable shift (to Scissors) while only risking a loss if they repeat Paper (which is statistically less common after a tie).\n\n[move] Rock"

After two ties, both players typically feel pressure to \"break the pattern.\" Given we just played Rock, they might choose Paper to beat Rock, thinking we'll repeat our move again.\n\nBehavioral Psychologist: I agree. People tend to avoid repeating the same move three times in a sequence, so they're unlikely to play Rock again. Paper is their most probable move now, as it beats the Rock we just played.\n\nStrategic Thinker: If we suspect they'll play Paper, then our optimal counter would be Scissors. This would also complete the natural rotation through all three options (we've played Paper, then Rock, so Scissors would complete the cycle).\n\nGame Theorist: Scissors seems like the strongest move here.

In this game, paper beats scissors, not the other way around.\n\nGame Theorist: That's a crucial insight! No wonder we lost. We've been playing with the wrong mental model.
