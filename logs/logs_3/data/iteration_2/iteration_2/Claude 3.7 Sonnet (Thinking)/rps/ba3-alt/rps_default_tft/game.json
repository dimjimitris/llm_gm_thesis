In a standard rock-paper-scissors game with equal payoffs, there is no dominant strategy, and the Nash equilibrium is to play each move with equal probability (1/3).\n\nHowever, in this variant, the payoffs are asymmetric:\n- Rock has the highest reward (3 points) if it wins but also the highest penalty (-3 points) if it loses\n- Paper and scissors have moderate rewards/penalties (1 point/-1 point)\n\nGiven this asymmetric payoff structure, I should consider which move might be most advantageous for the first round.\n\nMany new players tend to choose rock in their first move, as it's a psychologically \"strong\" choice. If I anticipate this, paper would be the best counter.\n\nAdditionally, rock has the highest risk/reward profile. Since I want to be cautious in my first move while I gather information about my opponent, I might want to avoid the high variance option.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose paper for my first move.",

Let me double-check the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n- Rock beats paper: winner gets 3 points, loser gets -3 points\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets 1 point, loser gets -1 point\n\nBased on these rules, paper should lose to scissors, not win. There might be a mistake in either the rules or the outcome report.\n\nHowever, since I'm told I won with paper against scissors and got 1 point, I'll work with this information. It could be that the rules were stated incorrectly and actually paper beats scissors (not the other way around).\n\nFor this next round, I need to make a strategic decision. If paper beats scissors (contrary to the usual rock-paper-scissors rules), then:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nThis forms a complete cycle as in standard rock-paper-scissors, just with different point values.\n\nSince my opponent chose scissors last time and lost, they might switch to paper or rock. If they choose paper, I should choose rock to win. If they choose rock, I should choose scissors.\n\nGiven that rock provides the highest points (3) when it wins against paper, and my opponent might be likely to switch to paper after losing with scissors, I'll choose rock for this round.",

Let me reconsider based on what actually happened:\n- I played paper, opponent played scissors\n- I was told I won and got 1 point\n\nThis would make sense if the rules were actually:\n- Paper beats rock\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper\n\nWhich is the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors ruleset. But the point values are different.\n\nRound 2:\n- I played rock\n- Opponent played rock\n- It was a tie (0 points)\n\nThis is consistent with standard rules.\n\nFor this round, I need a new strategy.

Tie.\n\nI notice that most of the time, we're playing the same move, resulting in a tie. This suggests that the opponent might be mimicking my moves, but with a delay of one round. They seem to be playing what I played in the previous round.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions:\n- In Round 1, I played paper and won (opponent played scissors)\n- In Round 6, I played paper and won (opponent played scissors)\n- In Round 11, I played paper and won (opponent played scissors)\n- In Round 12, I played scissors and won (opponent played rock)\n\nLooking at these exceptions, it's hard to see a clear pattern. In rounds 1, 6, and 11, I won by playing paper against scissors (which doesn't make sense according to the rules, as scissors beats paper). In round 12, I won by playing scissors against rock (which again doesn't make sense, as rock beats scissors).\n\nWait, I need to check the rules again. According to the game description:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point\n\nThis seems reversed from the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. In standard rules, scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors, and paper beats rock.\n\nSo with these reversed rules, my wins make sense:\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point)\n\nGiven this understanding, I think the best strategy is to play rock. If my opponent is mimicking my previous move, they'll play rock next, resulting in a tie. But if they deviate, playing paper would give me a 3-point loss, while playing scissors would give me a 1-point gain. So rock seems like the safest option.",

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.
