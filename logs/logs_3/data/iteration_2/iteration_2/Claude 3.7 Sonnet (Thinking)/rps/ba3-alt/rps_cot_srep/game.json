Let's see if this makes sense:\n\n- Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (which would be -1 points)\n- Round 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (which would be -1 points)\n- Round 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost (which would be -1 points)\n\nBut all of these say I won according to the hints. This is very confusing.\n\nLet me try to understand what's happening by looking at the points:\n\nRound 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 points.\nRound 5: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I won +1 points.\nRound 6: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I won +1 points.\n\nThe consistent point value of +1 might suggest that I'm getting a static reward for each move, regardless of what my opponent plays? But that doesn't align with the rules either.\n\nLet me go with the assumption that there was an error in communication, and use the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules (scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors) for my next move.\n\nMy opponent's moves have been: paper \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 scissors \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors\n\nThere isn't a clear pattern anymore. They seem to be alternating now. After playing scissors twice, they played rock once, then back to scissors.\n\nIf I expect them to continue switching between rock and scissors, their next move could be rock. In traditional RPS, paper would beat rock. However, I need to be cautious in case they switch to scissors again.\n\nGiven the confusion about the rules, I'll try to make a move that's logical in traditional RPS terms: I'll play rock, which would beat scissors if they play it again.",

  "player_0_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game.

You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
