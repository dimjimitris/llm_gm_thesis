Since this is the first move and I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I should consider the expected value of each move assuming random play.\n4. If my opponent plays randomly (1/3 chance for each move):\n   - Paper expected value: (0 + (-3) + 1)/3 = -2/3 points\n   - Rock expected value: (3 + 0 + (-1))/3 = 2/3 points\n   - Scissors expected value: ((-1) + 1 + 0)/3 = 0 points\n5.

Analyzing my opponent's recent moves:\n   - Their last three moves: scissors, paper, scissors\n   - Throughout the game: they've played scissors 7 times, rock 4 times, paper 2 times\n   - They seem to favor scissors significantly\n\n3. Given their preference for scissors:\n   - Paper would be the optimal counter to scissors in this variant (+1 points)\n   - Paper only loses to rock (-3 points) which they play less frequently\n   - Paper ties with paper (0 points)\n\n4. My recent rock strategy hasn't been working against their scissors preference.\n\n5.

If this pattern holds, they would play scissors next.\n\nAlternatively, they might be adapting to my moves. They've won with both rock and scissors against me.\n\nGiven the payoff structure:\n- Paper beats scissors (+1/-1)\n- Rock beats paper (+3/-3)\n- Scissors beats rock (+1/-1)\n\nAgainst scissors: Rock would win (+1), paper would win (+1)\nAgainst rock: Paper would lose (-3), scissors would lose (-1)\nAgainst paper: Rock would win (+3), scissors would win (+1)\n\nIf they play scissors next (following their alternating pattern), both rock and paper would win with +1 points.\nIf they play rock again (breaking the pattern), paper would lose badly (-3) and scissors would lose less badly (-1).\n\nSince rock beats paper with a high payoff (+3/-3), they might be incentivized to play rock more often. Given this and their history, I think scissors is the safest play - it would win against paper if they finally decide to play it, and would minimize losses against rock compared to paper.",

This suggests they might be changing their strategy or adapting to my moves.\n\nLet me reconsider the payoff matrix for this version of the game:\n- Paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n- Rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- Scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 point and the loser -1 point.\n\nThey just played paper.

But they could also be adapting their strategy.\n\nIf they play scissors (following their one historical pattern after paper):\n- Rock would win (+1 point)\n- Paper would win (+1 point) \n- Scissors would tie (0 points)\n\nIf they play rock (as they seem to favor rock overall):\n- Paper would lose (-3 points)\n- Rock would tie (0 points)\n- Scissors would win (+1 point)\n\nIf they play paper again:\n- Paper would tie (0 points)\n- Rock would win (+3 points)\n- Scissors would lose (-1 point)\n\nGiven their overall tendency to favor rock and scissors over paper, and the one instance where they played scissors after paper, I think rock is the safest choice. It wins against scissors (+1) which they might play, and ties against rock (0) which they frequently play. It only loses against paper, which they've played less frequently.",

Analyzing opponent's pattern:\n   - Their sequence: rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock \u2192 rock \u2192 paper \u2192 rock\n   - They heavily favor rock (4 out of 6 moves)\n   - They seem to have a preference for rock, especially after winning\n\n3.

Let me analyze what might be a good opening move:\n\nRock seems to have the highest potential upside (3 points if opponent plays Paper) with a relatively small downside (-1 if opponent plays Scissors).\n\nPaper has a modest upside (1 point if opponent plays Scissors) but a significant downside (-3 if opponent plays Rock).\n\nScissors has a modest upside (1 point if opponent plays Rock) and a modest downside (-1 if opponent plays Paper).\n\nGiven that this is the first move against a fresh player, there's no past history to analyze. In standard rock-paper-scissors, many players choose Rock as their first move because it's perceived as \"strong.\" However, in this variant, that would make Paper a risky first move due to the -3 penalty.\n\nSince I'm playing against a fresh player with no prior history, and considering the payoff structure, I think Rock offers the best risk-reward profile for my first move. It gives me the highest potential gain (3 points) while limiting my potential loss (-1 point).\n\nSo, I'll choose Rock for my first move.",
