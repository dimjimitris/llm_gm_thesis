    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented.

            "text": "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is a classic simultaneous game with mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. In pure game theory, the optimal strategy against a rational opponent is to play each move (rock, paper, scissors) with equal probability (1/3 each) to make yourself unpredictable. However, since we're told this is a \"fresh player,\" we might be able to exploit human behavioral patterns.\n\nPsychology Expert: Excellent point! Fresh players often exhibit predictable patterns. Research shows that beginners tend to favor rock as their opening move about 35-40% of the time due to its association with strength and aggression. Paper is chosen about 30% of the time, and scissors about 25-30%. There's also a slight tendency for people to avoid scissors initially as it feels more \"aggressive\" or \"risky.\"\n\nStatistics Expert: Given the psychological bias toward rock for fresh players, our best statistical play would be paper, which beats rock. However, we should also consider that if this opponent has any basic knowledge, they might anticipate that we know about the \"rock bias\" and counter accordingly. But for a truly fresh player, paper seems like the highest expected value move.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Based on your analysis, it seems paper is the optimal choice against a fresh player due to their statistical tendency to choose rock. The psychology expert's insight about the ~35-40% rock preference gives us a clear advantage if we choose paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with this reasoning. While the game-theoretically optimal mixed strategy would be random, exploiting known behavioral biases of fresh players is the better approach here. Paper maximizes our expected payoff given the information we have.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, and there's another factor - fresh players often make their first move based on what feels \"strong\" or \"safe\" to them, and rock fits that psychological profile perfectly.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to exploit the fresh player's likely tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] Paper"

            "text": "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nPsychology Expert: Interesting! The opponent chose scissors instead of the expected rock. This tells us several things: either they're not as \"fresh\" as indicated, or they're trying to be unpredictable, or they have some basic knowledge about RPS strategy. There's also a psychological pattern where players who lose often switch to what would have beaten their opponent's winning move - in this case, they might switch to rock (which beats our paper).\n\nGame Theory Expert: This is valuable data. The opponent deviated from typical fresh player behavior. Now we need to consider: are they playing randomly, do they have a pattern, or are they trying to counter-predict us? There's also the \"win-stay, lose-shift\" principle - since they lost, they're more likely to change their strategy than repeat scissors.\n\nStatistics Expert: With only one data point, we can't establish a reliable pattern yet. However, there are some tendencies we can consider: players who lose round 1 often avoid repeating their losing move (scissors in this case). They might switch to rock (thinking it beats our paper) or paper (copying our winning move). The probability of them playing scissors again is likely lower.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Given that they lost with scissors, they're unlikely to repeat it. The psychological tendency would be to either play rock (to beat our previous paper) or copy our winning move (paper). If they're thinking one level ahead and expect us to expect them to play rock, they might go with paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"hot hand\" fallacy consideration - they might think we'll stick with paper since it won. If they expect us to repeat paper, they'd choose scissors again, but that seems less likely given they just lost with it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I think rock is our best bet here. It beats scissors (if they're stubborn and repeat) and paper (if they copy our winning move or think we'll repeat paper). The main risk is if they play rock thinking they can beat our expected repeat of paper.\n\nStatistics Expert: Rock seems statistically sound given the opponent's likely psychological state after losing. It covers the most probable opponent responses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to counter their likely switch to paper or potential repeat of scissors.\n\n[move] Rock"

This gives us more insight into their pattern. They switched after losing, which is common behavior. The sequence scissors\u2192rock doesn't immediately suggest a clear pattern like rock\u2192paper\u2192scissors cycle, but it does show they're reactive to results.\n\nPsychology Expert: The tie in round 2 creates an interesting psychological situation. After a loss and then a tie, players often feel they need to \"break through\" and win. Since they just tied with rock, they're less likely to repeat it. There's also a tendency after ties for players to escalate to what they perceive as a \"stronger\" or more decisive move. They might think: \"Rock tied, what beats the opponent's likely next move?\"\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent is showing adaptive behavior rather than random play. They lost with scissors, switched to rock (which tied), so now they need to complete some kind of strategic thought process. If they think we're also being adaptive, they might try to predict our next move. Since we went paper\u2192rock, they might expect scissors next from us.\n\nAI Assistant (you): Let me analyze their possible thinking: They might expect us to continue the cycle (paper\u2192rock\u2192scissors), in which case they'd play rock to beat our expected scissors. Or they might think we'll stick with rock since it didn't lose, in which case they'd play paper. They're less likely to play scissors since that's what lost them round 1.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"gambler's fallacy\" aspect - some players think that since scissors \"failed\" them in round 1, it's somehow \"due\" for success. But more commonly, they'll avoid the move that caused their loss.\n\nStatistics Expert: Based on common patterns, the most likely opponent moves in order are: paper (to beat expected rock repeat), rock (if they think we'll play scissors in a cycle), and scissors (least likely due to round 1 loss). This suggests our best move is scissors to beat their most likely paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree with scissors. It beats paper (their most likely move) and loses only to rock (less likely given they just played it and tied).\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their most probable move of paper.\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent's sequence is: scissors, rock, scissors. This suggests they might be following some kind of alternating pattern or they're getting stuck in a loop. If they continue this way, the next move could be rock again (following scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors\u2192rock pattern) or they might break the pattern entirely.\n\nPsychology Expert: Two ties in a row creates frustration for most players. The opponent returned to scissors after their rock tied with ours, which suggests they might have some attachment to scissors or they're trying to \"redeem\" their first-round loss with that move. The psychology after two consecutive ties is usually to make a more decisive or different choice - they might completely switch strategies now.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The scissors\u2192rock\u2192scissors pattern is quite telling. If they're following a simple alternating pattern between scissors and rock, their next move would be rock. However, the fact that both ties happened might make them realize they need to incorporate paper into their strategy. They haven't played paper yet, which is unusual for three rounds.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're right - they haven't used paper at all yet! That's a significant observation. Most players would have tried all three moves by now. They might be avoiding paper for some reason, or they might be saving it as a surprise move. Given the frustration from two ties, they might finally play paper to break the deadlock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! There's a strong psychological tendency to try the \"unused\" option when current strategies aren't working. Since scissors and rock have both resulted in unfavorable outcomes (loss and ties), paper becomes very attractive as the \"fresh\" option.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they play paper (their unused move), we should play scissors. If they stick to their scissors/rock pattern and play rock next, we should play paper. Given that they haven't used paper yet, I think the probability of them playing paper is quite high - maybe 50-60%.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I agree. The combination of frustration from ties and having an unused move makes paper very likely. Scissors would be our best response to beat paper.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely paper move (their only unused option).\n\n[move] Scissors"

The opponent did exactly what we anticipated - they played their unused move (paper) after the frustration of two ties. However, we made a critical error in our execution. We correctly predicted paper but forgot that paper beats scissors, not the other way around. We should have played rock to beat their paper.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let me analyze their complete pattern now: scissors, rock, scissors, paper. They've now used all three moves, with scissors appearing twice. After winning with paper, there's a strong psychological tendency to either repeat the winning move or cycle to the next logical choice. The \"win-stay\" principle suggests they might stick with paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their victory with paper changes the dynamic significantly. They broke their scissors/rock alternation and found success. Players often repeat winning strategies, so paper is quite likely again. However, they might also think we'll expect that and switch. Given that paper just won for them, I'd estimate about 40-45% chance they repeat paper.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're absolutely right about our execution error. We predicted correctly but played the wrong counter-move. Now, if they're likely to repeat paper due to its success, we should play scissors this time - and remember that scissors actually beats paper, not loses to it!\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the \"hot hand\" effect - after a win, players often feel confident in their choice and may repeat it. Plus, they might think we learned our lesson and won't play scissors again, making paper feel \"safe\" to them.\n\nStatistics Expert: Looking at the probabilities: paper (most likely due to recent win), rock (possible return to their early pattern), scissors (least likely since it lost them round 1 and just tied). If paper is most probable, scissors is our best response.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Agreed. The combination of recency bias and the win-stay principle makes paper the most likely opponent move. We should play scissors to beat it.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to beat their likely repeat of the winning paper move.\n\n[move] Scissors"

I've been making a fundamental error with the game rules! Let me reread them: paper beats scissors, rock beats paper, scissors beats rock. So when the opponent plays paper, I need to play ROCK to beat them, not scissors! I've been playing the losing move twice in a row.\n\nGame Theory Expert: You're absolutely right! This is a crucial correction. We've been predicting their moves correctly but responding with the wrong counter-moves. Paper beats scissors, so when we predicted they'd play paper, we should have played rock, not scissors. This explains our recent losses.\n\nStatistics Expert: Now let's analyze their actual pattern with the correct understanding: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper. They've played paper twice in a row now and won both times. The \"win-stay\" principle is very strong after consecutive wins - they're likely to stick with paper again since it's been successful.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! Two consecutive wins with paper creates strong positive reinforcement. They're probably feeling confident about this choice and may think we haven't figured out how to counter it (which was true until now!). The probability of them playing paper again is quite high.\n\nAI Assistant (you): So if they're likely to repeat paper for the third time due to its success, I need to play rock to beat paper. Rock beats paper according to the rules.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Correct! Rock beats paper. Given their pattern of sticking with winning moves and the strong psychological reinforcement of two consecutive wins, rock is our best play here.\n\nStatistics Expert: The data supports this. Two wins in a row with the same move creates a strong bias toward repetition.

Now the opponent has lost after three consecutive wins with paper. This creates a very different psychological state. After being successful with paper and then losing, they're likely to abandon it temporarily. The \"lose-shift\" principle suggests they'll switch to a different move after their paper strategy was finally beaten.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's analyze their complete pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper. They clearly got attached to paper after it started winning, but now that it lost, they need to reassess. They haven't played rock since round 2, and scissors hasn't worked well for them overall (1 loss, 1 tie). They might return to rock or try scissors again.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The opponent just experienced the \"winning streak broken\" scenario. This typically leads to either: 1) Return to a previously successful move (rock worked okay - it tied), 2) Try the third option (scissors), or 3) Attempt to counter-predict what we'll do next. Since we just played rock successfully, they might expect us to repeat rock and play paper again.\n\nAI Assistant (you): But would they really go back to paper immediately after it just failed? That seems psychologically unlikely. They're more likely to avoid paper for at least one round after the loss.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly right. The recency of the paper failure makes it less attractive. Between rock and scissors, rock seems more likely because: 1) It didn't lose them any rounds (just tied once), and 2) Scissors has a poor track record for them (lost round 1, tied round 3).\n\nStatistics Expert: I agree. If we expect them to play rock (their most \"neutral\" move historically), we should play paper to beat rock. Paper beats rock according to the rules.\n\nGame Theory Expert: That makes sense.

Let's track their full pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors. They've now tried scissors again after their paper streak failed, and it failed again. They're showing a pattern of switching strategies when they lose - they don't stick with losing moves.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent is demonstrating clear \"lose-shift\" behavior. After scissors just lost (again), they're very unlikely to repeat it immediately. They haven't used rock since round 2, and it only tied then (which isn't as negative as losing). Paper lost in round 6 but isn't as fresh a failure as scissors. Between rock and paper, rock might feel \"safer\" since it's been unused for a while.\n\nGame Theory Expert: I notice they're cycling through their options when strategies fail. Scissors failed in round 1, they switched. Paper failed in round 6, they switched to scissors. Now scissors failed in round 7. The logical next step in their pattern would be to try rock, which has been \"resting\" since round 2.\n\nAI Assistant (you): That makes sense. Rock is their least recently used move and didn't actually lose for them (it tied). After two recent losses with scissors and paper, rock probably seems like the most attractive option psychologically.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they play rock, we need to play paper to beat it. Paper beats rock according to the game rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the factor that rock often feels like a \"reset\" move to players - when other strategies aren't working, rock feels solid and reliable. After recent failures, they might gravitate toward it.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The pattern analysis strongly supports rock as their next move. They're due to cycle back to it, and it's their psychological \"safe harbor\" after recent losses.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely return to rock (their unused move that represents a safe choice after recent failures).\n\n[move] Paper"

So if they play rock, I need scissors to beat it, not paper!\n\nGame Theory Expert: You're absolutely right! We've been making correct predictions but wrong executions.

This is the same type of error we made earlier in the game.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's look at their complete pattern now: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock.

Let's analyze their complete pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock. They just lost with rock after it won once. Following their established lose-shift behavior, they're very likely to abandon rock and try something else.\n\nPsychology Expert: The opponent has now experienced rock both winning and losing, so it's no longer their \"safe\" choice. They'll likely shift away from it. Looking at their recent history: scissors last won in round 7, paper last won in rounds 4-5 but lost in round 6. Between these options, scissors has the more recent positive association.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their pattern shows clear lose-shift behavior throughout the game. Rock just failed, so they'll switch. The question is whether they go back to scissors (which worked in round 7) or paper (which had a good streak earlier but failed more recently). Scissors seems more psychologically appealing given its recent success.\n\nAI Assistant (you): So if they're likely to return to scissors (their most recently successful non-rock move), I need to play rock to beat scissors. Rock beats scissors according to the rules.\n\nStatistics Expert: That logic seems sound. Scissors was their last winning move before the rock phase, and after rock failed, returning to scissors follows their lose-shift pattern perfectly.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, and there's also the factor that scissors feels more \"active\" or \"aggressive\" after a loss - players often want to make a more decisive move after being beaten, and scissors psychologically fits that mood better than paper.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Rock is indeed the correct counter to scissors. Given their behavioral pattern and the psychology of the situation, this seems like our best play.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely return to scissors (their most recently successful move before the failed rock strategy).\n\n[move] Rock"

Between scissors and rock: scissors last appeared in round 7 and lost, while rock had mixed results in rounds 8-9 (won then lost). However, rock's more recent success (round 8) compared to scissors' failure (round 7) makes rock psychologically more appealing.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Their lose-shift pattern is very consistent. Paper just failed, so they'll switch. Rock has more recent positive reinforcement than scissors does. Even though rock also lost in round 9, it did win in round 8, which is more recent than scissors' last success.\n\nAI Assistant (you): So if they're likely to return to rock (their most recently successful option between the two remaining choices), I need to play scissors to beat rock. Let me confirm: scissors beats rock according to the rules.\n\nStatistics Expert: That's correct. Rock seems to be their most probable next move given their behavioral pattern and the relative recency of success between their options.\n\nPsychology Expert: Yes, and there's also the psychological factor that rock often feels like a \"strong\" choice when players are frustrated with losses.

Let's analyze their complete pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors. They just tied with scissors. Looking at their behavior after ties: after round 2 (rock tie), they switched to scissors in round 3. After round 3 (scissors tie), they switched to paper in round 4. This suggests they treat ties similarly to losses - they shift away from the tied move.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! Ties create a similar psychological frustration as losses for many players - they didn't achieve their goal of winning. The opponent has consistently shown \"shift\" behavior after both losses and ties throughout the game. They'll likely abandon scissors after this tie.\n\nGame Theory Expert: So they need to choose between rock and paper. Let's compare their recent performance: paper last appeared in round 10 where it lost, while rock appeared in rounds 8-9 with mixed results (won, then lost). However, rock's win in round 8 is more recent success than any success paper has had since rounds 4-6.\n\nAI Assistant (you): You're right about their shift-after-ties pattern. Between rock and paper, rock does seem more psychologically appealing since paper's most recent appearance was a loss in round 10, while rock at least won in round 8 before losing in round 9.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they choose rock (which seems most probable), we need to play paper to beat it. Paper beats rock according to the game rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: Rock also has that psychological \"strength\" appeal after a frustrating tie.

So they'll abandon paper and choose between scissors and rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Their behavior after ties has been consistent throughout - they treat ties like losses and shift away. After the scissors tie in round 11, they went to paper in round 12. Now after the paper tie in round 12, they'll shift again.

Although both have some negative associations, rock at least has a more recent win (round 8) compared to scissors which has been struggling with mostly ties and losses recently.\n\nAI Assistant (you): So between scissors and rock, rock seems more psychologically appealing since it has at least one recent win in round 8, while scissors' most recent appearance was just a tie in round 11.

Let's analyze their complete pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper. They just lost with paper in round 20. Following their consistent lose-shift pattern, they'll abandon paper and choose between scissors and rock.\n\nPsychology Expert: Paper just failed after winning in round 19, so they'll definitely shift away from it. Between scissors and rock, let's compare recent performance: scissors appeared in rounds 15-16 (lost then won), while rock appeared in rounds 17-18 (won then lost). Scissors' most recent result was a win (round 16), while rock's most recent result was a loss (round 18).\n\nGame Theory Expert: That's a crucial insight! Scissors ended on a high note (winning in round 16) while rock ended on a low note (losing in round 18). Even though rock is more recent overall, scissors has the better final impression from its last appearance. After paper's failure, they might gravitate toward the option that left them with a positive last memory.\n\nAI Assistant (you): That makes perfect sense. Scissors' last result was a win in round 16, which creates a more positive association than rock's last result being a loss in round 18. The psychological appeal of scissors seems stronger.\n\nStatistics Expert: If they choose scissors, we need rock to beat it. Rock beats scissors according to the rules.\n\nPsychology Expert: There's also the psychological factor that scissors has been \"resting\" longer than rock (4 rounds vs 2 rounds since their last appearances), which might make it feel fresher and more appealing.\n\nGame Theory Expert: The analysis points to scissors as their most probable choice - better recent track record and longer rest period. Rock is our optimal response.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to beat their likely choice of scissors (which has a better recent track record with its last result being a win, unlike rock which last resulted in a loss).\n\n[move] Rock"

            "text": "Personas: AI Assistant (you); Game Theory Expert; Psychology Expert; Statistics Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nAI Assistant (you): I made another execution error! We correctly predicted they would play scissors, but I played rock when I should have played paper! Let me confirm the rules: scissors beats rock, so if they play scissors, I need paper to beat them. Paper beats scissors according to the rules.\n\nGame Theory Expert: This pattern of correct predictions but wrong execution is becoming deeply problematic! We predicted scissors correctly, but scissors beats rock, so we needed paper. Our analytical framework is sound but our execution continues to fail us.\n\nStatistics Expert: Let's track their complete pattern: scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors. They just won with scissors in round 21 after paper failed in round 20. The \"win-stay\" principle suggests they're very likely to stick with scissors since it just succeeded.\n\nPsychology Expert: Exactly! Scissors just won for them, breaking the disappointment of paper's failure. This creates strong positive reinforcement for scissors. After a successful move that comes after a failure, players typically repeat the winning strategy, especially when it validates their choice to switch.\n\nAI Assistant (you): So if they're likely to repeat scissors (due to win-stay after it just won), I need to play paper to beat scissors. Paper beats scissors according to the rules.\n\nGame Theory Expert: Correct! Paper beats scissors. The win-stay principle is very strong, especially after scissors just succeeded and gave them relief from paper's failure.\n\nStatistics Expert: The psychological and statistical evidence both strongly support scissors being repeated. Paper is our optimal counter-play.\n\nPsychology Expert: After scissors just won, they're feeling confident about that choice and will likely stick with the successful strategy.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: Play paper to beat their likely repeat of scissors (which just won for them and will likely be repeated due to win-stay principle).\n\n[move] Paper"

Following their consistent lose-shift pattern, they'll abandon scissors and choose between rock and paper.\n\nPsychology Expert: Scissors just failed after giving them one win, so they'll definitely shift away from it.

Both ended on losses, but rock has been \"resting\" longer (4 rounds vs 2 rounds).\n\nGame Theory Expert: The key insight is that rock has been unused for 4 rounds (since round 18) while paper was used more recently in round 20. The longer rest period often makes a move feel psychologically fresher and more appealing after recent disappointments.\n\nAI Assistant (you): That's a good analysis. Both rock and paper have the same recent track record (won then lost), but rock has had more time to \"recover\" psychologically from its failure.
