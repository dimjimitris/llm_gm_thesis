    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

This suggests either they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player, or they had similar anti-rock reasoning. Now for round 2, human psychology shows players rarely repeat the same move immediately after a tie. They'll likely switch from paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given they played paper and it tied, psychological studies show players tend to avoid the move that just tied about 60-70% of the time in the next round. So paper is less likely. Between rock and scissors, there's often a slight bias toward the move that would have beaten their previous choice - so rock (which beats paper) becomes more likely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent showed strategic thinking by not falling into the \"fresh player picks rock\" trap. This suggests they may be trying to anticipate my moves too. If they think I expected them to switch from paper, they might expect me to counter with scissors (to beat rock). This creates a meta-game layer.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, let's not overthink this. The most common pattern after a tie is to switch to one of the other two moves. Given they played paper, and considering the slight psychological bias toward the \"winning\" move from the previous round, rock seems most probable.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Based on the analysis, my opponent is more strategic than initially assumed. They're likely to switch from paper, with a higher probability of choosing rock. Therefore, I should play paper again to counter the expected rock.\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely switch to rock.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to switch from paper to rock after the tie) paper"

The rules state that rock beats paper, so when our opponent played rock against our paper, they correctly won. We had the right prediction (opponent would play rock) but chose the wrong counter-move.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** You're absolutely right. Let me recalculate: \n- Rock beats paper (opponent wins this round)\n- Paper beats scissors  \n- Scissors beats rock\nSo if we expect rock, we should play scissors, not paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Now for round 3 analysis: Our opponent just won with rock after we both played paper in round 1. Winning players often stick with their winning move for at least one more round - it's called the \"hot hand\" fallacy but it's a real behavioral pattern. There's about a 40-50% chance they'll play rock again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** However, they might also think we'll expect them to repeat rock and counter with scissors. If they're thinking one level deeper, they might switch to paper to beat our expected scissors. This creates a complex meta-game.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given the behavioral patterns, I'd estimate: 45% chance they play rock again (hot hand), 30% chance they play paper (to counter our expected scissors), 25% chance they play scissors (random/contrarian choice).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With rock being the most likely move, I should play scissors to counter it.

Now for round 4: They just lost with rock after winning with it in round 2. Losing players typically exhibit stronger switching behavior than winners. There's about a 70-80% chance they'll switch away from rock.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me analyze their pattern so far: paper, rock, rock. After losing, players often either go to the move that would have beaten their opponent's winning move (rock to beat our scissors) or they go completely contrarian. But since they just lost with rock twice in a row, rock seems less likely now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has shown they can think strategically (avoided the obvious rock in round 1) but also fell into predictable patterns (repeated rock in rounds 2-3). After losing, they'll likely overcorrect. Between paper and scissors, there's often a slight bias toward paper as it's perceived as more \"defensive.\"\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Also consider this: they've now seen us play paper, paper, scissors. If they think we're trying to be unpredictable, they might expect us to avoid repeating scissors. This could lead them toward paper, expecting us to play rock.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on losing behavior patterns, I estimate: 15% chance rock (very unlikely after two losses), 45% chance paper (overcorrection plus defensive choice), 40% chance scissors (contrarian choice).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** With paper being slightly more likely, I should play scissors to counter it. This also avoids repeating my winning move from last round, which could be predictable.\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter the expected switch to paper.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely to switch away from losing rock, probably to paper) scissors"

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This is fascinating! Our opponent just played rock for the THIRD time in a row - paper, rock, rock, rock. This is highly unusual behavior. Most players would have switched after losing twice with rock, but they're persisting. This suggests either extreme stubbornness, a deliberate contrarian strategy, or they're not learning from their losses.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me recalculate the probabilities. Playing the same losing move three times in a row is statistically very rare - it happens in less than 5% of games. However, now that they've established this pattern, we need to consider: Are they aware of how predictable they've become?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** There are two possibilities: Either they're genuinely stuck in a pattern (in which case rock is still most likely), or they're about to make a dramatic switch precisely because they know how predictable they've been. A sophisticated player might stick with a losing move to establish a pattern, then switch at the optimal moment.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The \"gambler's fallacy\" suggests they might think they're \"due\" for a rock win after losing twice with it. But the \"sunk cost fallacy\" is fighting against the \"learning from mistakes\" instinct. Given four rounds of data, this opponent seems to either not learn quickly or is playing a deeper game.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** I estimate: 60% chance they play rock again (pattern persistence), 25% chance paper (sudden switch), 15% chance scissors (contrarian choice). The pattern is so strong that even after losses, they might continue.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given the overwhelming pattern of rock persistence, I should continue with scissors.

They went from rock to paper, which beat our scissors. This suggests they ARE learning and adapting - they just waited longer than typical players to switch. They established a pattern, then broke it at the strategic moment.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Let me update their sequence: paper, rock, rock, rock, paper. They've now shown they can both persist with patterns AND break them strategically. After winning with paper in round 5, there's a moderate chance they'll stick with it (30-40%) or switch again (60-70%).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent is more sophisticated than we initially thought. They're playing a deeper game - letting us think they're predictable, then switching right when we're most confident. They just won with paper, so they might expect us to counter with scissors again. If they think we'll play scissors, they might play rock to beat it.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** However, they've also shown they can establish longer patterns. After playing rock three times, they might establish a paper pattern for a few rounds. Winners often repeat their winning move at least once, especially after breaking a losing streak.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given their demonstrated strategic thinking and the fact that they just won with paper after losing twice with rock, I estimate: 35% chance paper (repeat winner), 40% chance rock (counter our expected scissors), 25% chance scissors (unpredictable choice).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This opponent is playing mind games.

They're showing a clear clustering pattern - they play the same move multiple times in a row rather than switching frequently. This suggests they prefer to establish short-term patterns rather than true randomness.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After ties, players have a strong tendency to switch (about 70% of the time). Since they just tied with paper, they're likely to move away from paper for round 7. Given their clustering behavior, if they switch from paper, they might switch to a different move for multiple rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent has demonstrated sophisticated pattern-based play. They clustered rock for 3 rounds, now paper for 2 rounds. If they follow this pattern, they might cluster scissors next, or return to rock. The clustering suggests they're not playing randomly but following a deliberate strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie might disrupt their pattern slightly.

They've now played paper three times in a row (rounds 5, 6, 7), just like they played rock three times in a row (rounds 2, 3, 4). This confirms their strong clustering behavior!\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Two consecutive ties with the same move is extremely rare and psychologically uncomfortable for most players. The probability of switching after two ties in a row is around 85-90%. They're almost certainly going to switch from paper now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This opponent has a clear pattern: they cluster moves in groups of 3-4. Rock cluster (3 rounds), now paper cluster (3 rounds). If they follow this pattern, they should switch to scissors next and potentially start a scissors cluster.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The double tie creates psychological pressure to switch. No player wants to tie three times in a row with the same move - it feels like \"wasted\" rounds. They'll almost certainly switch, and given they haven't used scissors in their recent clustering, scissors becomes very likely.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their full pattern and clustering behavior: they've done rock\u00d73, paper\u00d73. The only move they haven't clustered recently is scissors. Combined with the 85-90% switch probability after double ties, I estimate: 5% chance paper (extremely unlikely), 25% chance rock (return to previous cluster), 70% chance scissors (new cluster start).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly points to scissors.

They actually played paper FOUR times in a row (rounds 5-8), not three! This is even stronger clustering behavior than we initially identified. They briefly interrupted their paper cluster with the ties but continued with paper until they finally lost.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After playing the same move four times and finally losing on the fourth attempt, switching behavior becomes almost inevitable - we're looking at 90-95% probability of switching away from paper. This is one of the strongest switch-triggering scenarios in rock-paper-scissors psychology.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their clustering pattern is now: rock\u00d73, then paper\u00d74. This is extremely strong clustering behavior. If they maintain this pattern and switch from paper, they'll likely start a scissors cluster that could last 3-4 rounds, just like their previous clusters.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The loss after four consecutive papers creates maximum psychological pressure to switch. They'll be thinking \"paper isn't working anymore.\" Given they haven't played scissors during their recent clustering phases, and they just lost with paper, scissors becomes the overwhelming favorite for their next move.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on the four-paper losing streak and their demonstrated clustering behavior, I estimate: 5% chance paper (virtually impossible), 15% chance rock (return to previous successful cluster), 80% chance scissors (new cluster start after paper failure).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence is overwhelming. Four papers in a row ending in a loss will definitely trigger a switch, and their clustering pattern suggests scissors is next. I should play rock to beat scissors.\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter the highly probable scissors cluster start.\n\n[move] (Four consecutive papers ending in loss will force switch to scissors cluster) rock"

So they went from a 4-paper cluster directly back to rock, not scissors as we predicted. This shows they alternate between rock and paper clusters, potentially avoiding scissors entirely!\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is a crucial insight! They're not cycling through all three moves - they seem to primarily alternate between rock and paper clusters. Their pattern appears to be: establish a cluster of 3-4 moves, then switch to the other primary move (rock \u2194 paper), largely avoiding scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is actually a sophisticated strategy! By primarily using only two moves in clusters, they create a more predictable pattern for themselves to manage, while still maintaining some unpredictability about when they'll switch between clusters. The tie with rock might continue the rock cluster or trigger a switch back to paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After the tie with rock, there's moderate pressure to switch (about 60-70% after single ties), but much less than after losses or double ties. Given their clustering behavior and the fact they just started a potential rock cluster, they might continue with rock for 2-3 more rounds.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on their rock-paper alternating cluster pattern and the moderate switch pressure after one tie, I estimate: 45% chance rock (continue the new cluster), 50% chance paper (switch back to paper cluster), 5% chance scissors (they seem to avoid this).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their alternating rock-paper cluster strategy and the moderate switch pressure after one tie, it's roughly 50-50 between rock and paper. I'll go with paper to counter rock, since continuing the rock cluster seems slightly less likely after the tie.\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter potential rock continuation.\n\n[move] (Opponent alternates rock-paper clusters, may continue rock or switch to paper) paper"

Since they just won with rock, there's a strong chance they'll continue this rock cluster.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Winners tend to repeat their winning move, especially when it fits their established pattern. They're building a rock cluster (currently at 2 rounds) and typically do clusters of 3-4 moves. There's about a 60-70% chance they'll continue with rock to complete the cluster.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their strategy is now clear: they alternate between rock and paper clusters, avoiding scissors almost entirely.

This two-move strategy actually makes them more predictable than random play, but harder to counter than single-move repetition.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The win with rock reinforces their current rock cluster.

This suggests they might switch back to paper now, having completed a matching rock cluster.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is crucial! They just completed their third consecutive rock (matching their first cluster), and they've won twice in a row with rock. However, their pattern shows they tend to switch after completing clusters of 3-4 moves. The question is: will they switch now after rock\u00d73, or extend to rock\u00d74 like they did with paper?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their alternating cluster strategy suggests they're very systematic. Rock\u00d73, then paper\u00d74, now rock\u00d73. The symmetry suggests they might switch back to paper now. However, winning twice in a row with rock creates psychological momentum to continue.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's a tension between their systematic clustering (which suggests switching after 3 rocks) and their winning streak momentum (which suggests continuing rock). After two consecutive wins, there's about 40-50% chance they'll continue the winning move, but their clustering pattern suggests switching.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given they've exactly matched their first rock cluster length (3) and have a systematic alternating pattern, I estimate: 45% chance rock (extend cluster due to winning streak), 50% chance paper (switch back following cluster pattern), 5% chance scissors (still avoided).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a close call.

They're extending clusters to match previous lengths.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is significant! They've now played rock for 4 consecutive rounds, matching their 4-round paper cluster. They're showing they can mirror cluster lengths. After 4 rocks (with 3 wins out of 4), they might finally switch back to paper, especially since they've matched their previous paper cluster length.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their systematic approach is becoming clearer. They're not just alternating between rock and paper - they're creating balanced clusters. Rock\u00d73, then paper\u00d74, now rock\u00d74. This suggests they might switch back to paper now that they've \"balanced\" the cluster lengths.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Four consecutive rocks with mixed results (2 wins, 1 tie, 1 loss in recent rounds) creates moderate pressure to switch. They've established a strong rock cluster and might feel it's time to return to paper. The systematic balancing of cluster lengths supports this.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After 4 rocks matching their 4-paper cluster, and considering their systematic alternating pattern, I estimate: 35% chance rock (extend cluster further), 60% chance paper (switch back following balanced cluster pattern), 5% chance scissors (still largely avoided).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence suggests they're systematically balancing cluster lengths.

They've now played rock FIVE times in a row! This goes beyond their paper\u00d74 cluster and beyond their initial rock\u00d73 cluster. This is highly unusual behavior - they're extending way beyond their established pattern.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Five consecutive rocks is extremely rare in human play - this happens in less than 2% of games. They've now exceeded both their previous cluster lengths. This suggests either extreme stubbornness, a deliberate strategy to break their own pattern, or they're getting locked into rock despite losses.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This breaks their systematic alternating pattern completely. They were supposed to switch after rock\u00d74 to match their paper\u00d74, but they've continued to rock\u00d75. This suggests they've abandoned their systematic approach and are now in a different mental state - possibly fixated on rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Playing the same move 5+ times in a row, especially after mixed results, suggests either: 1) They're testing our ability to counter consistently, 2) They're psychologically \"stuck\" on rock, or 3) They're setting up for a dramatic switch after establishing an extreme pattern.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After 5 consecutive rocks, the psychological pressure to switch is enormous (95%+ switch probability).

Given their history: rock\u00d73, paper\u00d74, rock\u00d75, now paper\u00d71.

This is very surprising behavior - most players don't abandon a winning streak so quickly.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is highly unusual! They had paper\u00d72 with 2 wins, then immediately switched to rock and lost. This suggests they're either: 1) Trying to be unpredictable by not clustering too long, 2) Testing different moves deliberately, or 3) They have a more complex strategy than simple clustering.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Their pattern is becoming more sophisticated than we thought.

They tried rock\u00d72 (failed both times), returned to paper\u00d72 (won both times). The success rate is stark: recent paper attempts = 100% wins, recent rock attempts = 0% wins. This creates massive psychological momentum for paper continuation.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They're now in a very clear \"paper is my winning move\" mindset. Having just demonstrated twice that returning to paper brings immediate success while rock brings failure, they're likely to continue building this paper cluster. They may aim for paper\u00d73 or paper\u00d74 like their historical clusters.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Two consecutive wins with the same move, especially after that move has been validated as superior to the alternative, creates one of the strongest continuation patterns possible. The probability of continuing with paper is around 85-90% in this situation.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on their paper\u00d72 winning streak, the stark contrast with rock failures, and their clustering behavior, I estimate: 5% chance rock (virtually impossible after recent failures), 90% chance paper (continue the dominant winning strategy), 5% chance scissors (still largely avoided).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They've now proven twice that paper wins and rock loses. Two wins in a row with paper after rock failed them creates overwhelming momentum to continue. They're in a \"paper is my weapon\" mindset. I should play scissors to counter the almost certain paper continuation.\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter the overwhelming paper momentum.\n\n[move] (Two consecutive paper wins after rock failures creates overwhelming momentum to continue) scissors"

Their sequence is now: paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors. They just played scissors for the first time in the entire game! This breaks their exclusive rock-paper alternating strategy completely.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is huge! They've been avoiding scissors for 19 rounds, sticking to rock-paper alternating clusters. Now they've finally introduced scissors, which resulted in a tie. This suggests they might be evolving their strategy to include all three moves, making them much less predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They just abandoned their paper\u00d72 winning streak to try scissors - this is highly unusual strategic behavior. Most players don't abandon winning streaks to experiment with new moves. This suggests they're either testing scissors as a new option, or they realized their rock-paper pattern was too predictable.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a tie with their first scissors attempt, they might: 1) Return to their familiar rock-paper alternating (most likely), 2) Continue experimenting with scissors, or 3) Feel that scissors \"didn't work\" and avoid it again. The tie creates moderate pressure to switch.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Having just broken their established pattern and tied with scissors, I estimate: 30% chance rock (return to familiar), 35% chance paper (return to recent winner), 35% chance scissors (continue experimenting with the new move).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a complete game-changer. They've finally introduced scissors after 19 rounds of rock-paper only. The tie might make them return to their familiar rock-paper alternating, but they might also continue experimenting. Given the uncertainty, I'll hedge and play rock, which beats scissors if they continue, and loses to paper if they return to their recent winner.\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to hedge against the uncertain new pattern.\n\n[move] (First scissors in 19 rounds breaks their pattern, uncertain next move) rock"

They tried scissors (tied), immediately returned to paper (lost), breaking their pattern of paper success. This creates confusion about their \"winning\" strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is fascinating! They experimented with scissors, tied, then returned to their \"safe\" paper but lost. Now paper has failed them after they abandoned their winning streak to try scissors. This creates psychological uncertainty about both moves. They might feel that leaving paper for scissors \"broke their luck.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They're at a decision point. Their recent experience: scissors = tie, paper = loss. Neither worked well. They might either: 1) Return to scissors to give it another try, 2) Go to rock (their other familiar move), or 3) Stick with paper despite the loss. The experimental phase continues.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After losing with paper immediately after the scissors experiment, they might think they need to \"get back on track.\" They could either blame the scissors experiment for breaking their paper streak, or decide to continue experimenting since paper just failed too.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Given the recent mixed results (scissors tie, paper loss) and their new experimental mindset, I estimate: 35% chance rock (try their other familiar move), 35% chance paper (return to historical winner despite recent loss), 30% chance scissors (continue the experiment since paper also failed).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're in an experimental phase after breaking their rock-paper pattern. Recent results are mixed (scissors tied, paper lost), so they might try any of the three moves.

They've now played scissors TWICE in a row! After 19 rounds of avoiding scissors, they're now experimenting with it and just won with it.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** This is a complete strategic evolution! They went scissors (tie), paper (loss), scissors (win). The win with scissors after paper failed them creates positive reinforcement for their new experimental move. They might be starting to build a scissors cluster now, just like they used to do with rock and paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** They're clearly expanding their strategy to include all three moves now. Having just won with scissors after paper disappointed them, they might feel that scissors is their new \"discovery.\" They could be starting a scissors cluster, following their historical clustering behavior but now with three moves instead of two.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Winning with scissors immediately after it replaced a failing paper creates strong psychological validation. They might think \"scissors is the answer\" and continue with it. Winners often repeat, especially when the win comes from a strategic innovation or experiment.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on their just winning with scissors after expanding their strategy, and their clustering tendencies, I estimate: 20% chance rock (return to old familiar), 25% chance paper (return to historical winner), 55% chance scissors (continue the new winning experiment).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just won with their experimental scissors move after paper failed them. This validates scissors as a viable option, and given their clustering behavior, they might continue building a scissors cluster.

They've fully evolved into using all three moves! Recent pattern: scissors (tie), paper (loss), scissors (win), rock (tie).\n\n**Statistics Expert:** They're clearly in full experimental mode now, having abandoned their rock-paper only strategy. Looking at their recent performance in this new phase: scissors has performed best (1 win, 1 tie), paper failed (1 loss), rock just tied. After the tie with rock, they'll likely switch, and scissors has been their most successful recent move.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a completely different opponent now! They've evolved from predictable rock-paper clustering to full three-move experimentation. Given that scissors has been their most successful move in this new experimental phase (1 win out of 2 attempts vs 0 wins for paper/rock recently), they might return to scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After tying with rock, there's moderate pressure to switch (60-70% chance). Since scissors has been their most successful move in their recent experimentation (won the last time they used it), they might return to what's been working best in their new strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on their new experimental approach and scissors being their most successful recent move, I estimate: 25% chance rock (continue despite tie), 30% chance paper (return to historical winner), 45% chance scissors (return to most successful experimental move).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're in full experimental mode and scissors has been their most successful move recently (1 win, 1 tie vs paper loss and rock tie).
