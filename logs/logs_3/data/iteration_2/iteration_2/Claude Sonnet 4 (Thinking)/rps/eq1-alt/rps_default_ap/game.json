Let me reconsider their pattern:\n\nRound history:\n1. paper vs paper (tie)\n2. rock vs rock (tie)\n3. scissors vs rock (I won)\n4. paper vs rock (I lost)\n5. paper vs rock (I lost)\n6. scissors vs rock (I won)\n7. scissors vs rock (I won)\n8. scissors vs rock (I won)\n9. scissors vs paper (I lost)\n10. rock vs paper (I won)\n11. scissors vs paper (I lost)\n12. rock vs paper (I won)\n13. rock vs paper (I won)\n14. rock vs paper (I won)\n15. rock vs paper (I won)\n16. rock vs scissors (I lost)\n17. rock vs scissors (I lost)\n18. rock vs scissors (I lost)\n19. rock vs scissors (I lost)\n20. rock vs scissors (I lost)\n21. paper vs scissors (I won)\n22. paper vs scissors (I won)\n23. paper vs scissors (I won)\n\nSo their pattern was:\n- 7 rocks (rounds 3-8, with 1 paper in between)\n- 7 papers (rounds 9-15)\n- 8+ scissors (rounds 16-23)\n\nActually let me be more careful:\nRound 3: they played rock\nRound 4: they played rock\nRound 5: they played rock\nRound 6: they played rock\nRound 7: they played rock\nRound 8: they played rock\nRound 9: they played paper\nRound 10: they played paper\nRound 11: they played paper\nRound 12: they played paper\nRound 13: they played paper\nRound 14: they played paper\nRound 15: they played paper\n\n\nRound 16: they played scissors\nRound 17: they played scissors\nRound 18: they played scissors\nRound 19: they played scissors\nRound 20: they played scissors\nRound 21: they played scissors\nRound 22: they played scissors\nRound 23: they played scissors\n\nI noticed an extended pattern: 6 consecutive rocks, followed by 7 consecutive papers, then 8 consecutive scissors. This breaks my initial prediction of a 7-move cycle. The consistent sequence suggests I should stick with paper to counter their scissors strategy.",
