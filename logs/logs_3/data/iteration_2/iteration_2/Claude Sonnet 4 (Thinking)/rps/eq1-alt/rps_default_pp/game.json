Let me read again:\n\n\"- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nHmm, this is different from the normal rock-paper-scissors rules. Normally:\n- Rock beats scissors\n- Scissors beats paper  \n- Paper beats rock\n\nBut according to these rules:\n- Paper beats scissors\n- Rock beats paper\n- Scissors beats rock\n\nSo in this version, paper beats scissors, which means I did win correctly.

Switch to a different move\n2. Try the same move again\n3. Try to counter what they think I'll do\n\nSince I won with paper, they might expect me to play paper again and choose rock (which beats paper according to these rules).

That's the opposite of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game I'm familiar with.\n\nIn Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors. According to the rules, paper beats scissors, so I should have won and gotten +1 points. The hint message said I won and scored 1 point, which is correct.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie, 0 points each.\n\nSo the opponent's pattern so far: scissors, then rock.\n\nThey might be trying to counter what they think I'll play next, or they might be playing randomly. Since they started with scissors (which lost to my paper) and then switched to rock (which tied with my rock), they might try paper next to beat rock, or they might try scissors again, or stick with rock.\n\nI should think strategically. If they think I might play rock again (since I just played it), they might play paper to beat it. If they think I'll switch from rock, they might try to predict what I'll switch to.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'll go with scissors this time, which would beat rock if they stick with it, or beat paper if they try to counter my previous rock move.",

Let me assume the hint is correct and I won somehow.\n\nActually, let me re-read the rules:\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.  \n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read:\n\"paper beats scissors\" - so paper wins against scissors\n\"rock beats paper\" - so rock wins against paper  \n\"scissors beats rock\" - so scissors wins against rock\n\nSo in round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won because paper beats scissors.\n\nRound 2: I played rock, opponent played rock, tie.\n\nRound 3: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I lost because... wait, let me check. Scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors. So scissors should beat paper, but the hint said I lost. Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I think I misread the rules. Let me read again:\n\"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nHmm, this might be non-standard rules. Let me think about what happened:\n- Round 1: paper vs scissors, I won with paper\n- Round 2: rock vs rock, tie  \n- Round 3: scissors vs paper, I lost with scissors\n\nSo if paper beats scissors, and I lost scissors vs paper, then paper must beat scissors. That's the standard rule.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense with rock beats paper. \n\nI see a unique game variation where the typical rock-paper-scissors rules are slightly modified. The sequence follows an unusual pattern where paper unexpectedly beats scissors, breaking from the standard game mechanics. This creates an intriguing twist in the traditional game's logic, challenging my initial understanding of the rules.\n\nMy opponent's move sequence suggests a deliberate strategy - cycling through scissors, rock, and paper in order. I'll need to anticipate their next potential move carefully.",

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
