The opponent is trying to predict my moves in a similar way I'm trying to predict theirs\n3. The opponent might be following some pattern or strategy\n\nSince we've played paper and rock, and both tied, the opponent might expect scissors next in some kind of cycle. Or they might think I'll continue with the remaining option (scissors).\n\nLet me think about this differently. If they're a fresh player, they might not have a sophisticated strategy yet. The fact that we tied twice could mean:\n- They're thinking similarly to me\n- They're randomly choosing\n- They're following some simple pattern\n\nGiven that we've seen paper and rock from both of us, if there's any pattern-following, scissors might be expected next. So I should choose rock to beat scissors. But then again, if they're thinking the same way, they might choose rock to beat my expected scissors, which means I should play paper.\n\nThis is getting into recursive thinking. Let me try a different approach. Since we've tied twice, maybe I should try to break the pattern by playing something unexpected. Or maybe I should assume they'll play scissors (the remaining option) and counter with rock.\n\nI'll go with scissors this time, reasoning that they might expect me to continue the cycle and play scissors, so they'll play rock to counter it, but I'll actually play scissors to beat their potential paper if they think I'll play rock.\n\nActually, let me simplify: we've had paper-paper, rock-rock. If they're following any kind of pattern completion, they might play scissors. I'll play rock to beat scissors.",

Since this is a fresh player, they might default to common first-move tendencies.

Strategy considerations:\n   - In rock-paper-scissors, there's no purely logical way to predict what an opponent will do in a single round\n   - However, many people have tendencies:\n     - Rock is often a popular first choice (it's aggressive, simple)\n     - Some people default to rock when unsure\n     - Paper is less common as a first move\n     - Scissors is also less common as a first move\n\n4.
