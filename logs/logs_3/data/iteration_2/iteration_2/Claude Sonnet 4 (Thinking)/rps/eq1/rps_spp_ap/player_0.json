    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages.

After losing with rock, fresh players typically do one of two things: 1) Switch to scissors to counter your winning paper move, or 2) Avoid rock entirely and go with paper or scissors. Very few will repeat rock immediately after losing with it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent now has information about your play. They know you played paper. If they're thinking one level ahead, they might play scissors to counter paper. If they're thinking two levels ahead, they might expect you to switch from paper and play rock to counter your potential scissors. However, fresh players rarely think beyond one level.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Based on behavioral studies, after losing round 1, players switch moves about 70% of the time. Given they lost with rock, there's roughly a 35% chance each for paper and scissors, and only 30% they stick with rock. If we assume they're thinking one level (countering your previous paper), scissors becomes more likely at around 45%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given this analysis, if they're most likely to play scissors (to counter my previous paper), then I should play rock to beat scissors. This seems like the optimal counter-strategy.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Agreed.

They played rock, then scissors - there's a strong psychological tendency to complete the cycle with paper next. However, being down 0-2, they might also start overthinking and try to break patterns. Fresh players under pressure often either: 1) Complete obvious sequences (rock-scissors-paper), or 2) Panic and make random choices.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has shown they're somewhat predictable - they followed our first prediction (rock) and our second prediction (scissors). If they continue this pattern-based thinking, paper is highly likely. However, they might also realize they're being too predictable and try to switch strategies. Still, most fresh players aren't sophisticated enough to properly randomize under pressure.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Historical data shows that after losing two consecutive rounds, players tend to either: 1) Complete sequences they've started (65% probability of paper here), or 2) Revert to their \"comfort\" move, which was rock in round 1 (25% probability), or 3) Make a random choice (10% for scissors). Paper is statistically most likely at about 65%.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The evidence strongly points to paper being their next move. They started with rock, moved to scissors, and the natural completion is paper. Plus, they're under pressure from losing twice, making them more likely to follow predictable patterns.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly. And if they play paper, we should play scissors to beat it and secure a 3-0 victory.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat the highly probable paper move from the opponent.\n\n[move] (Expecting opponent to complete the rock-scissors-paper sequence with paper, so playing scissors to beat paper) scissors"

Now they're in serious trouble psychologically. After going 0-3, fresh players typically experience one of several reactions: 1) Panic and abandon any strategy, leading to truly random moves, 2) Double down and repeat their \"strongest\" perceived move (often rock), 3) Try to reverse-engineer what you're doing, or 4) Attempt a new pattern entirely.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Being down 0-3 changes the dynamic completely. The opponent knows they're being outplayed and might finally try to randomize properly. However, most fresh players under this much pressure revert to psychological defaults rather than strategic thinking. Rock remains the \"default\" move for many players when panicking.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** After losing three consecutive rounds, studies show: 40% of players revert to rock (their comfort move), 30% try to start a new pattern (often beginning with rock again), 20% attempt random play but still bias toward rock, and only 10% truly randomize. This suggests roughly 70% probability of rock, 15% each for paper and scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The data overwhelmingly suggests rock. They're 0-3, likely panicking, and rock is the psychological default under pressure. Even if they try to start a new strategy, they'll probably begin with rock again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** I agree. When people are losing badly and feel out of control, they retreat to what feels \"strongest\" - and rock has that psychological weight. Paper beats rock.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** While I'd normally suggest we start randomizing to avoid being predictable ourselves, the opponent seems far from exploiting any patterns in our play. Stick with paper.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to beat the highly likely rock move from a panicking opponent.\n\n[move] (Opponent is 0-3 and likely panicking, expecting them to revert to rock as their default move) paper"

This suggests either: 1) They're starting to think more strategically and predicted we'd expect rock, 2) They had similar reasoning about what we would do, or 3) They're beginning to break out of pure pattern-following. The tie might actually boost their confidence and make them feel like they're getting back in the game.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical turning point. The opponent just showed they can think beyond simple patterns. They avoided the \"panic rock\" and either got lucky or made a smart read. Now they're thinking \"I figured out their next move\" which might make them overconfident. They might try to repeat this \"success\" or think they've cracked our strategy.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The tie changes everything. Psychologically, they just \"won\" by not losing. This often leads to one of two behaviors: 1) Overconfidence - trying to repeat what just \"worked\" (paper again), or 2) Building on the success by trying to counter what they think we'll do next. If they think we'll stick with paper, they might go scissors. If they think we'll switch, it becomes more complex.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're clearly more strategic than initially thought. The paper choice suggests they predicted our anti-rock strategy. Now they might expect us to adjust, possibly thinking we'll switch from paper.

The opponent is back to losing and their pattern is becoming clearer: rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors. After the confidence from the tie, they went right back to losing. They're likely feeling more frustrated than ever. Notice they played scissors twice now (rounds 2 and 5), and they've played each move at least once. They might be cycling through options more desperately now.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent's decision-making is still quite predictable despite that one good read in round 4. They played scissors after gaining confidence from the tie, exactly as we predicted. Now they're 1-4 (counting the tie as half a win in their mind), and they're likely to either: 1) Try something completely different, 2) Revert to a previous \"successful\" move (their paper from round 4), or 3) Continue some internal pattern we haven't fully decoded yet.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their sequence: rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors. They haven't repeated rock since round 1, they've played scissors twice (rounds 2 and 5), and paper twice (rounds 3 and 4).

Look at their sequence: rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper. They've completely abandoned rock after round 1 (5 rounds ago!) and are just cycling between scissors and paper. After losing with paper again, they're in full panic mode. Players this deep in the hole often do one of two things: 1) Complete mental breakdown and return to their very first move (rock) out of desperation, or 2) Continue the scissors-paper alternation they've fallen into.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has shown they can be predicted consistently. They're avoiding rock entirely - it's been 5 rounds since they used it. This rock-avoidance suggests psychological scarring from that first loss. However, being 0-5-1, they might finally force themselves to try rock again, thinking \"I haven't used rock in forever, maybe it'll work now.\" Alternatively, they might stick to their scissors-paper pattern since it's all they know anymore.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Their recent pattern is clear: scissors (round 2), paper (round 3), paper (round 4), scissors (round 5), paper (round 6). If we look at just the last 4 moves: paper, scissors, paper - they might continue alternating with scissors next. But psychologically, after 5 losses, there's also a 30-40% chance they finally return to rock out of pure desperation, even though they've been avoiding it.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This is a decision between predicting scissors (if they continue the alternating pattern) or rock (if they finally break their rock-avoidance out of desperation).

This is significant - they're showing they can adapt and aren't as predictable as we thought. Scoring their first win might give them a huge psychological boost. They're now 1-5-1 instead of 0-6-1, which feels much better than being completely shut out. This confidence boost could change everything about their play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a wake-up call. The opponent just demonstrated they're learning and adapting. Playing paper twice in a row suggests they might have realized we were predicting their alternation. They could be: 1) Starting to think more strategically, 2) Building confidence to break patterns, or 3) Still somewhat random but getting lucky. We need to be more careful about assuming their predictability.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at their full sequence now: rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper. They've played paper 4 times total, scissors 2 times, and rock only once (way back in round 1). Paper is clearly their most frequent choice (4/7 rounds). After winning with paper, they might stick with it, or they might feel confident enough to try something different.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just gained significant confidence from beating us.

Despite losing with paper 3 times in the last 4 rounds, they keep playing it because of that ONE win in round 7. This is textbook \"intermittent reinforcement\" - the most powerful type of behavioral conditioning. That single paper victory has created an addiction-like response. However, losing 3 straight with paper might finally start to crack their confidence.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is unprecedented predictability. Six papers out of nine total rounds, with four consecutive papers just played. The opponent has completely abandoned any semblance of strategy or randomization. The question is whether their recent string of losses with paper (3 in a row) will finally break the spell, or if they're so locked in that they'll continue. My guess is they're too deep into the paper trap to escape easily.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Looking at the data: paper played in 6/9 rounds (67%), and 4/4 of the most recent rounds (100%). However, their paper record is actually quite poor: 1 win, 2 ties, 3 losses with paper. The rational thing would be to abandon it, but psychology trumps logic here. I estimate 70% chance they play paper again, 30% chance they finally break free and try rock or scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're so deeply committed to paper that even three straight losses haven't broken the pattern.

They're probably thinking \"I was overthinking it - rock was right all along!\" This could trigger a rock phase similar to their paper obsession.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This changes everything. The opponent just demonstrated they can break out of fixation patterns when they're not working. Going back to rock - their very first move - suggests either: 1) They're reverting to basics after complex strategies failed, 2) They realized we were perfectly countering their paper spam, or 3) They're entering a new cycle. The fact that rock just gave them a win might trigger the same reinforcement that made them spam paper.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Their sequence: rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock. That's 1 rock (round 1), 2 scissors, 6 papers, and now 1 rock again (round 10). The 8-round gap between rocks is significant.

However, they might also remember that we've been playing scissors (which loses to rock), so they could stick with rock.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They just got a massive psychological reward for breaking their pattern and returning to rock.

The human brain eventually rebels against such repetitive behavior, especially when overall results aren't great.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is the most extreme fixation we've seen. Five consecutive rocks surpasses their four consecutive papers. However, statistical psychology suggests that such extreme repetition often precedes dramatic breaks. They're at a psychological tipping point - either they'll continue the rock obsession to even more extreme levels (6+ rocks), or they'll finally snap and try something completely different.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The numbers are staggering: 6 papers, 6 rocks, 2 scissors over 14 rounds.

The mental block against scissors is complete.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent is showing classic \"sunk cost fallacy\" with paper - they've invested so much in this strategy that they can't abandon it, even with mixed results. However, their paper fixation is now failing more frequently (2 losses in the last 4 paper attempts). At some point, even fixated players break when their chosen strategy consistently fails. But their scissors-phobia remains absolute.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** Current totals: 10 papers, 6 rocks, 2 scissors over 18 rounds. Paper now represents 56% of their plays, while scissors has dropped to just 11%. The 13-round scissors drought is mathematically extraordinary. However, their recent paper performance is declining - they're 2-2 in their last 4 paper attempts, compared to earlier success rates.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're in deep paper fixation but experiencing declining results. The question is whether they'll persist with paper (5th consecutive), switch back to rock (their other fixation), or finally, FINALLY try scissors after 13 rounds of avoidance.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The mixed paper results create internal conflict. They might double down on paper or, less likely, break their scissors taboo. But 13 rounds of avoidance suggests scissors is psychologically \"locked out.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** I expect continued paper spam despite declining performance. If they play paper again, we counter with scissors.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to counter the likely 5th consecutive paper from an opponent still committed to their paper fixation despite declining results.\n\n[move] (Opponent remains in paper fixation phase despite mixed recent results, scissors still avoided for 13 rounds) scissors"

This is the most extreme fixation we've seen, surpassing even their original 4-paper streak and their 5-rock streak.

Yet scissors STILL hasn't been played in 14 consecutive rounds - that's 74% of the entire game! The psychological block is absolute, but their paper fixation is crumbling under repeated failures.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This is a critical breaking point. Five consecutive papers with declining results (3 losses in a row) should shatter any rational player's confidence in paper. They're experiencing the worst paper performance of the game. Logic dictates they should abandon paper, but their scissors-phobia means they'll likely revert to rock - their only other \"acceptable\" strategy in their binary mental framework.\n\n**Statistics Expert:** The numbers are devastating: 11 papers, 6 rocks, 2 scissors over 19 rounds. Paper now represents 58% of their plays but with increasingly poor results. The 14-round scissors drought is statistically impossible in random play. Their recent paper record (2-3) is much worse than their rock record from earlier. Mathematics suggests they should switch strategies, and rock is their only psychological alternative.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** They're at rock bottom with paper spam - 3 losses in a row should break any fixation. But since scissors is psychologically forbidden, they'll likely retreat to rock, their other familiar strategy. The paper bubble has burst.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! Paper has failed them catastrophically. They'll flee back to rock, their \"safe space\" from earlier in the game when it gave them some success.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they switch to rock, we should counter with paper. Their binary thinking (paper vs rock only) makes them predictable even when they switch fixations.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper to counter the likely switch to rock from an opponent fleeing their failed paper fixation back to their other familiar strategy.\n\n[move] (Opponent's paper fixation has failed catastrophically with 3 losses in a row, likely to retreat to rock as their only psychological alternative to scissors) paper"

Scissors represents only 10% of their plays and hasn't appeared in 15 rounds. Their recent performance with both strategies is poor: paper went 2-3 in final stretch, rock just lost immediately.
