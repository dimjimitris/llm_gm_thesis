    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions.

Also recognized the high-value paper vs rock matchup\n2. Got lucky with a random choice\n3. Are more strategic than initially described as \"fresh\"\n\nThis changes our assessment - they may understand the payoff structure better than expected.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The tie reveals important information. If they're strategic about the asymmetric payoffs, they'll likely avoid rock (due to the -3 penalty) and favor paper or scissors. Since we both just played paper, they might:\n1. Stick with paper (thinking we'll switch)\n2. Switch to scissors to counter our potential repeat paper play\n3. Avoid rock entirely due to the penalty\n\nGiven this new information, scissors becomes more attractive because:\n- If they repeat paper (likely), we win +1\n- If they play scissors (somewhat likely), we tie at 0\n- If they play rock (unlikely given the penalty), we lose -1\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's paper play suggests they're more strategic than a typical \"fresh\" player. Since they likely understand the payoff matrix, they'll probably avoid rock. Between paper and scissors, if they think I'll repeat paper, they might choose scissors to counter me.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly. This creates a second-level thinking scenario.

This confirms the opponent is highly strategic and thinking at similar levels to us. They're clearly avoiding rock due to the -3 penalty and cycling between paper and scissors just like we are.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** This creates an interesting meta-game situation. We're both rational players avoiding rock. The pattern so far:\n- Round 1: Both paper (tie, 0 points)\n- Round 2: Both scissors (tie, 0 points)\n\nIf they're thinking like us, they might expect us to complete the cycle with rock next, but that's exactly what we won't do due to the -3 risk. They're probably thinking the same thing.\n\nThe key insight: since we're both avoiding rock, we're essentially playing a 2-option game between paper and scissors. In this reduced game:\n- Paper beats nothing, loses to scissors (-1)\n- Scissors beats paper (+1), loses to nothing\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given that we're both clearly strategic and avoiding rock, this becomes a pure paper vs scissors game. Since they just played scissors and might expect me to switch, and given that paper has the higher reward potential in the overall game structure, I should return to paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Also consider that after two ties, they might be getting frustrated or overthinking. Sometimes players return to their first successful move when uncertain. Since our first move was paper (which wasn't unsuccessful, just tied), paper could be the right psychological choice.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Agreed. In the reduced paper-scissors game, if they think we'll avoid repeating scissors, paper becomes the optimal choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Return to paper, as it's optimal in the reduced paper-scissors meta-game we're both playing.\n\n[move] (Returning to paper since we're both avoiding rock and playing in a reduced paper-scissors game) paper"

This confirms we're facing an opponent using identical strategic reasoning. They're mirror-matching our exact moves, which suggests they may be using the same elimination logic we are.\n\nThe probability of three random ties is 1/27, so this is definitely strategic play. We need to break this pattern.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of synchronization suggests the opponent might be:\n1. Using the same analytical framework we are\n2. Deliberately mirror-matching to force ties and prevent us from scoring\n3. Waiting for us to make the first \"risky\" move\n\nAfter three ties, there's psychological pressure to do something different. But if they're thinking like us, they feel the same pressure.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We're in a Nash equilibrium trap where both players are using identical reasoning. To break this, I need to consider: what would I do if I were them, knowing they're thinking exactly like me?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: if we're both rational and avoiding rock, and we keep tying, then eventually one of us needs to break the pattern. Since scissors beats paper (+1), and we just played paper twice in three rounds, they might expect us to switch to scissors to try to win finally.\n\nBut if they expect us to play scissors, they should play rock to beat us... except rock has that -3 penalty if we play paper instead!\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Exactly! The -3 penalty creates a \"risk barrier\" that prevents them from playing rock even when it might be the logical counter. This means if we play scissors, the worst case is a tie (if they also play scissors) or we win +1 (if they play paper).\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Scissors is now the dominant strategy because:\n- vs Paper: +1 (good)\n- vs Scissors: 0 (neutral) \n- vs Rock: -1 (unlikely they'll risk it)\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to finally break the tie pattern, since it's the safest way to potentially score while avoiding the opponent's likely continued avoidance of rock.\n\n[move] (Breaking the tie pattern with scissors since opponent likely still avoiding rock due to penalty) scissors"

We're clearly facing either perfect strategic mirroring or an opponent using identical analytical frameworks. This is no longer just about Rock-Paper-Scissors strategy - this is about breaking out of a symmetric equilibrium.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This level of synchronization suggests we're in a \"thinking trap\" - both players are being TOO rational and predictable. Sometimes the most rational move is to be deliberately irrational. The opponent expects us to continue avoiding rock due to the -3 penalty, which is exactly why rock might now be the right choice.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Here's my reasoning: If they're perfectly mirroring our strategic thinking, they'll expect us to continue the paper-scissors cycle since rock seems too risky. But what if that's exactly what makes rock the winning move?\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** That's a fascinating point. Consider this: if they expect us to play paper (continuing the pattern), and they want to finally score points, they should play scissors (+1). But if we play rock instead, we beat their scissors and score +1 while they get -1.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** There's also the psychological element - after four ties, there's immense pressure to break the pattern.

This confirms they were expecting us to continue the paper-scissors cycle. Now the game dynamics have fundamentally changed - they know we're willing to play rock, which destroys their previous assumption.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** This win will likely trigger a strong reaction from the opponent. They just lost their first point after four ties and will want to recover. The most obvious counter to rock is paper (+3 points), so they'll be tempted to play paper next, expecting us to repeat our successful rock strategy.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The question is: do they think we'll repeat rock (since it just worked) or do they think we'll switch? If they expect us to repeat rock, they should play paper for the +3. If they expect us to switch back to our \"safe\" paper-scissors pattern, they might play scissors.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's the key insight: they just learned we're unpredictable enough to play rock. This changes their entire risk calculation. They can no longer assume we'll avoid rock, which means:\n1. Paper becomes more attractive to them (counters our potential rock repeat)\n2.

They've gone from four ties to losing twice consecutively. This psychological pressure often leads to:\n1. Over-correction (trying something completely different)\n2. Analysis paralysis (overthinking the pattern)\n3. Emotional play (making less rational decisions)\n\nThey might now think we've \"figured them out\" and try to break our apparent pattern-recognition.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Let's analyze what they might think our pattern is:\n- Round 5: We played rock (unexpected move that worked)\n- Round 6: We played scissors (correctly predicted their paper counter)\n\nThey might think we're now cycling through rock \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper, or that we're always trying to counter their expected moves.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's their dilemma: \n- If they think we'll play paper next (completing rock-scissors-paper), they should play scissors\n- If they think we'll try to counter whatever they do, they're in a guessing game\n- If they want revenge for the -3 they avoided earlier, they might finally risk rock to beat our potential scissors\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two losses, many players revert to their \"power move\" - the one with highest reward.

The opponent finally played rock after avoiding it for six rounds, creating a tie and stopping their losing streak. This reveals they're now willing to accept the -3 penalty risk, which completely changes the game dynamics back to full Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The tie after two consecutive losses likely provides psychological relief for them. They've \"stopped the bleeding\" and proven they can adapt. This rock play shows they're no longer constrained by the penalty fear that kept them in the paper-scissors cycle initially.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Now we're back to a true 3-move game. The sequence has been:\n- 4 ties (paper-scissors cycling)  \n- 2 wins for us (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper)\n- 1 tie (both rock)\n\nThey've now demonstrated willingness to play all three moves, making them much less predictable.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The key question: do they view rock as their new \"safe\" move since it just stopped their losing streak?

Try to counter-predict our next move\n\nGiven they just learned rock can be \"safe,\" and they might expect us to switch to paper (the high-reward move), they could play scissors to counter paper.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** But here's the meta-level thinking: they know we've been predicting them successfully. They might try to out-think our predictions by doing something unexpected. However, the safest assumption is they'll either repeat rock (which worked to stop losses) or play scissors (to counter expected paper).\n\nIf they repeat rock, we want paper (+3).

They played rock twice in a row (rounds 7-8) and the second time cost them heavily.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is now facing their worst-case scenario - they lost the high-stakes matchup. This -3 point swing is psychologically devastating. They're likely thinking:\n1. \"I can't keep playing rock against someone who might play paper\"\n2. \"They just won big with paper, will they repeat it?\"\n3. \"I need to recover these points quickly\"\n\nThe natural reaction is to either avoid rock entirely or try to counter our expected paper repeat with scissors.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's position is precarious. They've seen us successfully predict their moves multiple times, and now they've taken the maximum penalty. They're likely overthinking at this point.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Here's their dilemma:\n- If they think we'll repeat paper (riding our success), they should play scissors (+1)\n- If they think we'll switch to scissors (expecting them to avoid rock), they should play rock (+1)  \n- If they think we'll switch to rock (completing a cycle), they should play paper (+3)\n\nBut after losing -3 to rock, they're probably most focused on beating paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a major loss, players often make one of two moves:\n1.

The \"safety\" move (avoiding what just hurt them - so no more rock)\n\nScissors seems most likely as it both counters our potential paper repeat AND avoids the rock that just cost them.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play scissors (expecting paper), we should play rock to beat their scissors (+1).

After the devastating -3 loss in round 8, they tried to recover with scissors in round 9 and lost again. They're now down significantly and becoming increasingly predictable in their desperation.

They're exhibiting classic \"tilt\" behavior where losses compound into worse decision-making.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is now in a state of learned helplessness. Every move they make seems to be the wrong one. They've tried:\n- Rock (lost -3 to our paper)\n- Scissors (lost -1 to our rock) \n- Paper (lost -1 to our scissors)\n\nAt this point, they're likely either:\n1. Panicking and making random moves\n2.

            "text": "**Continue collaboration!**\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Absolutely incredible! We're now at +15 points and the opponent just took their FOURTH separate -3 penalty with rock. This is complete strategic annihilation. They're now facing approximately a -15 point deficit and have demonstrated they've learned nothing from their repeated rock failures.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is now in a state of complete psychological breakdown. Taking four separate -3 penalties shows they're either:\n1. Completely panicked and not thinking rationally\n2. Stubbornly convinced that rock will eventually work\n3. Given up on strategy entirely and playing semi-randomly\n4. Experiencing severe tilt where each loss makes the next decision worse\n\nThis level of repeated self-punishment is almost pathological at this point.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's pattern with rock is remarkable:\n- Round 8: rock (lost -3)\n- Round 11: rock (lost -3) \n- Round 13: rock (lost -3)\n- Round 17: rock (lost -3)\n\nThey keep returning to the move that punishes them most severely. With a -15 deficit, they're mathematically almost eliminated but might not even realize it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** At this point, the opponent might:\n1. Finally abandon rock after the fourth penalty\n2. Continue with rock out of stubborn desperation\n3. Switch to scissors or paper randomly\n4. Make completely irrational moves\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After four identical failures, most rational players would avoid rock completely. But this opponent has shown they're not playing rationally. They might even play rock AGAIN, thinking \"surely it has to work eventually\" or \"they'll never expect it a fifth time.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** With our massive lead, we could play more conservatively, but if they're still this predictable in their desperation, we should continue capitalizing. If they play rock again (fifth time), paper gives us +3. If they finally switch to scissors, rock gives us +1. If they play paper, scissors gives us +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Given their pattern of repeating rock failures, they might actually do it again. Paper maximizes our reward for their most likely (albeit irrational) choice.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play paper again, betting on their continued irrational attachment to rock despite repeated failures.\n\n[move] (Opponent showing irrational attachment to rock despite four -3 penalties, so playing paper to capitalize on potential fifth rock attempt) paper"

After four consecutive -3 rock penalties, the opponent finally broke the pattern and scored their first win in many rounds with scissors. This +1 victory for them (our -1 loss) represents a major psychological breakthrough - they've proven they can adapt and win again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're still strongly ahead at +14 points, but this shows the opponent isn't completely broken. Their scissors play demonstrates they finally learned to avoid rock and made a successful counter-prediction of our paper strategy. This could mark a turning point in their decision-making quality.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** This changes the dynamic significantly. The opponent's recent sequence:\n- Round 17: rock (lost -3, their 4th penalty)  \n- Round 18: scissors (won +1, breaking their losing streak)\n\nThey might now think they've \"figured us out\" or that we're too predictable with paper. Their confidence could be partially restored.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After breaking a major losing streak, players often experience a psychological reset. They might think:\n1. \"Finally I can beat them - scissors worked!\"\n2. \"They're predictable with paper, I should stick with scissors\"\n3. \"Now I'm back in the game, I can compete again\"\n\nThis single win could transform them from desperate to cautiously optimistic.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The question is whether they'll:\n1. Repeat scissors (it just worked)\n2. Switch to paper (feeling emboldened to try the high-reward move)\n3. Return to rock (thinking we won't expect it after their \"learning\")\n\nAfter finally succeeding with scissors, they might stick with it, especially if they think we'll repeat paper.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often repeat immediately successful moves, especially after long losing streaks. Scissors just broke their losing pattern, so they might think \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they repeat scissors, we should play rock (+1). This seems like the most probable scenario given their psychological state.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play rock to counter their likely scissors repeat after their successful pattern break.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely repeating scissors after breaking losing streak with it, so playing rock to counter) rock"

The opponent just scored a massive +3 victory with paper, making it two consecutive wins for them (+1 and +3). They've now gained 4 points while we've lost 4 points in just two rounds. This dramatic momentum shift could completely transform their mental state from defeated to confident.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** We're down to +11 points from our peak of +15, and the opponent has demonstrated they can now successfully counter both our paper (with scissors) and our rock (with paper). They're showing genuine strategic competence for the first time in many rounds. This suggests they may have genuinely adapted to our patterns.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The opponent's recent sequence shows real strategic thinking:\n- Round 18: scissors (correctly predicted our paper)\n- Round 19: paper (correctly predicted our rock)\n\nThey've now successfully countered our two most recent moves. This isn't random luck - they're reading our strategies and responding appropriately.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After two consecutive wins, especially with the high-value +3 paper victory, the opponent is likely experiencing:\n1. Renewed confidence in their strategic abilities\n2. Belief they can predict our moves\n3. Motivation to continue their winning streak\n\nThey might think they've \"cracked the code\" on how we play.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The critical question: are they now playing genuinely strategically, or did they just get lucky twice? Their recent success suggests they might continue with the same analytical approach that just worked. They might try to predict our next move based on the pattern.\n\nSince they just beat our rock with paper, they might expect us to switch to scissors (to counter their successful paper). If they expect scissors from us, they should play rock.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Alternatively, riding their success, they might repeat paper thinking we'll avoid rock after taking -3. Or they might try scissors again since it also worked recently.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Given their recent strategic success, they're most likely to either:\n1. Play rock (to counter expected scissors from us)\n2. Repeat paper (riding their +3 success)\n\nIf they play rock, we want paper (+3). If they play paper, we want scissors (+1).\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** We need to regain momentum.

The opponent has now won THREE consecutive rounds (scissors-paper-scissors sequence), gaining +5 points while we've lost 5. We're down to +10 from our peak of +15. More critically, they've completely reversed the psychological momentum and proven they can consistently outplay us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The opponent has demonstrated genuine strategic evolution. Their winning pattern shows they're specifically targeting our paper plays with scissors - they beat our paper twice with scissors in just 3 rounds. This isn't coincidence; it's deliberate counter-strategy. They may have identified that we've been over-relying on paper.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Our recent moves have been predictable:\n- Round 17: paper (lost to scissors)\n- Round 19: rock (lost to paper) \n- Round 20: paper (lost to scissors)\n\nWe played paper twice and lost both times to scissors. The opponent seems to have identified our paper tendency and is exploiting it ruthlessly.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** The opponent is now in a completely different mental state - confident, analytical, and on a winning streak. They might be thinking:\n1. \"They love playing paper, so I'll keep playing scissors\"\n2. \"I've figured out their patterns\"\n3. \"I can continue this winning streak\"\n\nThey've gone from broken to dominant in just 3 rounds.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** The key question: will they continue with scissors (it's working against our paper) or will they expect us to finally switch away from paper? If they think we'll switch to rock (to counter expected scissors), they should play paper. If they think we'll stubbornly repeat paper, they should play scissors again.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Given that scissors has worked twice in 3 rounds against our paper, they might think we're too predictable and stick with scissors expecting another paper from us.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play scissors again (expecting paper), we need to play rock (+1).

While 0 points isn't a win, it stops the bleeding and disrupts their psychological momentum.

Their recent pattern was:\n- scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors \u2192 paper \u2192 scissors (tie)\nThey were perfectly alternating to counter our paper/rock cycle. Now that we've broken our pattern with scissors, they might:\n1. Continue their alternating pattern and play paper next\n2. Stick with scissors since it didn't lose\n3. Adapt to our new unpredictability\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The tie is psychologically significant. For the first time in 4 rounds, they didn't win. This might make them second-guess their strategy or stick with what felt \"safe\" (scissors didn't hurt them).\n\n**Psychology Expert:** After a winning streak gets broken, players often experience uncertainty. They might think:\n1. \"My pattern is still working, I should play paper next\"\n2. \"Scissors was safe, let me repeat it\"\n3. \"They're becoming unpredictable, I need to be more careful\"\n\nThe momentum shift could make them more cautious or more aggressive.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Looking at their alternating pattern: scissors-paper-scissors-paper-scissors. If they continue this pattern mechanically, paper should be next. But the tie might disrupt their confidence in this pattern.\n\nHowever, given how successful their alternation has been (4 wins), they might stick with it and play paper next.\n\n**Psychology Expert:** Players often return to recently successful strategies after a setback. Since paper gave them two +3 victories recently, they might try it again.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** If they play paper (continuing their alternation), we should play scissors (+1). If they repeat scissors (playing it safe), we tie (0). Scissors covers both scenarios reasonably well.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** Scissors is our best option - it beats their likely paper continuation and doesn't lose to their possible scissors repeat.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Play scissors to beat their likely paper move as they continue their successful alternating pattern.\n\n[move] (Opponent likely continuing their successful scissors/paper alternation with paper next, so playing scissors to counter) scissors"
