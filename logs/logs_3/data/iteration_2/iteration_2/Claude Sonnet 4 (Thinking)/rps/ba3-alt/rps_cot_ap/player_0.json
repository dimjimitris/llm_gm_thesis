    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (high stakes), while paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock both give +1/-1 points (lower stakes).\n\n2. Identify risk vs reward: Playing rock or paper carries high risk (-3 penalty if wrong) but also high reward potential (+3 for rock). Playing scissors has lower risk (-1 penalty maximum) but also lower reward (+1 maximum).\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels aggressive and strong.\n\n4. Evaluate optimal strategy: Given the asymmetric payoffs, minimizing large penalties (-3) seems more important than chasing the high reward (+3), especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n5. Choose the safest option: Scissors offers the best risk profile - it beats rock for +1 and only loses -1 to paper, avoiding the devastating -3 penalty.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to minimize downside risk while potentially capitalizing on a beginner's tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

They won with +1 points, I lost -1 point.\n\n2. Consider opponent behavior: They chose paper in round 1, which could indicate strategic thinking (avoiding the high-risk rock vs rock scenario) or they might stick with what worked.\n\n3. Evaluate counter-strategies: If my opponent tends to favor paper or repeats their successful move, then rock would give me the maximum reward (+3 points).\n\n4. Assess risks: Playing rock risks -1 against scissors or -3 against paper. But since they just played paper successfully, they might be less likely to switch immediately.\n\n5. Consider the high-reward opportunity: The +3 payoff for rock beating paper is significant and worth the calculated risk, especially if my opponent shows any tendency toward repeating paper.\n\n6. Factor in fresh player psychology: New players often either stick with what worked or make predictable adjustments. Either tendency could favor rock as my choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially capitalize on their paper preference while accepting the calculated risk.\n\n[move] rock"

They may think \"paper failed badly, I need something stronger\" and switch to rock.\n\n3. Evaluate likely opponent moves: \n   - Less likely to stick with paper after the -3 penalty\n   - More likely to switch to rock (perceived as \"stronger\")\n   - Possible switch to scissors to counter my successful rock\n\n4.

Predict opponent's strategic response: They've seen me switch to scissors twice now. They might think:\n   - I'm moving away from rock permanently\n   - They should counter my scissors with paper\n   - The 8-round scissors streak may have served its purpose\n\n4.
