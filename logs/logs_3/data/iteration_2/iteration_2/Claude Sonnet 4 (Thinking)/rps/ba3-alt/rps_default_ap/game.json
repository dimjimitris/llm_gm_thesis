Normally in rock-paper-scissors, scissors beats paper. But according to these rules, paper beats scissors. Let me trust the rules as given.\n\nSo for round 2, I need to think about what my opponent might do. They played scissors in round 1. Since they're a \"fresh player,\" they might not have a clear strategy yet. \n\nLooking at the payoff matrix:\n- If I play rock and they play paper: I lose 3 points\n- If I play rock and they play scissors: I win 1 point  \n- If I play rock and they play rock: tie, 0 points\n\n- If I play paper and they play rock: I win 3 points\n- If I play paper and they play scissors: I win 1 point\n- If I play paper and they play paper: tie, 0 points\n\n\nI see scissors has limited potential. Paper looks like the most versatile choice, beating both rock and scissors.

The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
