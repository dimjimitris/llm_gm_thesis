    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

This is not a \"fresh\" player anymore. They're adapting strategically.\n\nCurrent score: I'm at -3 total, they're at +3. The gap is significant.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The opponent showed clear adaptation after losing round 2. They learned that paper beats scissors, so they switched to rock to beat paper. This suggests:\n1. They're learning the game dynamics quickly\n2. They might expect me to avoid paper after that -3 loss\n3.

After two scissors, then two rocks, the natural progression might be paper. However, losing the last round might make them reconsider.\n\nIf they play paper, rock wins +3 (huge gain). If they stick with rock, scissors wins +1. If they go back to scissors, paper wins +1.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern suggests paper is coming next.

Still behind by 2 points.\n\nThis is statistically extraordinary. Five consecutive rocks with multiple ties and losses suggests either:\n1. Extreme psychological fixation (rock anchor bias is overwhelming)\n2. A deliberate strategy to condition me to expect rock\n3. They're about to execute a massive pattern break\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Five rocks is beyond typical human behavior patterns. Most players would have switched after 2-3 failed attempts. This level of persistence suggests either:\n1. Complete inflexibility (they truly believe rock is optimal)\n2. They're setting up the ultimate mind game - expecting me to counter-adapt\n3.

The opponent's complete sequence is:\n- Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors\n\nThey broke the 5-rock pattern by returning to scissors! Current score: I'm at -2, they're at +2. The gap is widening.\n\nThis suggests they might be cycling: Started with scissors (2x), then rock (5x), now back to scissors. If this is a cycle pattern, they might play scissors again, or move to the next phase.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The return to scissors after 5 rocks is psychologically significant. They went back to their \"original successful move\" from round 1. This could indicate:\n1. They're cycling through strategies (scissors phase, rock phase, back to scissors phase)\n2. They remembered scissors worked initially and are giving it another try\n3. They're testing if I've become conditioned to expect rock\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** If they continue with scissors, rock wins +1. If they switch back to rock (continuing the back-and-forth), scissors wins +1. If they try paper for the first time, rock wins +3.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Rock seems optimal here. It beats scissors (+1) if they repeat their successful move, beats paper (+3) if they finally try the third option, and only loses to rock (-1) if they immediately switch back.\n\nGiven they've never played paper in 8 rounds, there's also a chance they might try it now.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Agreed on rock. The psychology suggests they're either continuing their renewed scissors strategy or will try something new. Rock handles both scenarios well.\n\n**Finish collaboration!**\n\n**Final decision:** Rock\n\n[move] (Covering their likely scissors continuation while positioning for potential first-time paper usage) rock"

If they continue this scissors phase, rock wins +1. But I need to be more aggressive about closing this gap.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** The opponent has shown clear pattern cycling behavior. They're comfortable with extended phases of the same move.

Down by 4 points.\n\nThey're now in a 2-rock phase, potentially starting a new long rock phase similar to their earlier 5-rock phase and 11-scissors phase. Their pattern shows they do ultra-long phases of the same move.\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** Perfect read! They switched from scissors to rock after losing too many times, and now they're starting what could be another extended rock phase. You correctly countered with scissors and won +1.\n\nGiven their pattern of persistence, they'll likely continue with rock until you force them to switch by consistently countering.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** The pattern is clear: They play rock, I play scissors, I win +1. Same principle as before - don't overthink it.\n\n**Game Theory Expert:** Exactly! The math is simple:\n- Rock vs Scissors = Scissors wins +1\n- They've shown they do long phases\n- Keep countering correctly until they're forced to switch\n\n**Behavioral Psychology Expert:** This opponent rewards discipline and pattern recognition. They'll stick with rock until you consistently beat it, just like they did with scissors. Stay focused on the correct counter.\n\n**AI Assistant (me):** I'm sticking with the winning formula.
