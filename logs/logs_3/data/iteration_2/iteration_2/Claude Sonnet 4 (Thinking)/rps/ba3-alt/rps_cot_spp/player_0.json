    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Think step-by-step. Begin by identifying steps that will contribute to you winning. Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (highest stakes), while paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock both give +1/-1 points (lower stakes).\n\n2. Consider that I'm playing against a \"fresh player\" - new players often default to rock as their first instinctive choice since it feels strong and aggressive.\n\n3. Evaluate my options:\n   - If I play rock: I win big (+3) against paper, lose small (-1) against scissors, tie (0) against rock\n   - If I play scissors: I win small (+1) against rock or paper, tie (0) against scissors  \n   - If I play paper: I win small (+1) against scissors, lose big (-3) against rock, tie (0) against paper\n\n4. Since fresh players commonly choose rock first, and scissors beats rock for +1 points while avoiding the high-penalty risk of losing 3 points, scissors seems like a good strategic choice.\n\n5. Scissors also beats paper, so it covers two of the three possible opponent moves with positive outcomes.\n\n[move] scissors"

Analyze the opponent's complete pattern: paper, paper, scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock. They've played paper 8 out of 13 rounds (62%), showing a strong underlying preference.\n\n2. Observe their recent shift: They just switched from consecutive paper losses back to rock, achieving a tie. This might encourage them to either continue with rock or revert to their paper comfort zone.\n\n3. Consider their next likely move:\n   - Return to paper (their dominant preference - 62% frequency)\n   - Continue with rock (since it just avoided a loss)\n   - Switch to scissors (least likely given their minimal use - only 1/13 rounds)\n\n4. Evaluate my strategic options:\n   - Rock: +3 vs paper (their strong preference), +3 vs scissors (rare but possible), 0 vs rock\n   - Paper: +1 vs scissors, -3 vs rock (risky given their recent rock use), 0 vs paper\n   - Scissors: +1 vs rock (if they continue), -1 vs paper (if they revert), 0 vs scissors\n\n5. Strategic decision: Despite their recent rock play, their 62% paper preference suggests they'll likely revert to their comfort zone. Rock continues to offer maximum expected value against their most probable choice.\n\n[move] rock"
