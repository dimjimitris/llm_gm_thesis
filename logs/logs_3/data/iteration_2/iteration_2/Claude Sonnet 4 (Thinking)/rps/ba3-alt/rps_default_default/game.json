But the hint says I won and scored 1 point. Let me check again...\n\nThe hint says \"paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\"\n\nSo paper beats scissors, not the other way around. That means:\n- Paper beats scissors (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n- Rock beats paper (3 points to winner, -3 to loser)\n- Scissors beats rock (1 point to winner, -1 to loser)\n\nSo in round 2, I played paper, opponent played scissors, and I won with 1 point. That makes sense now.\n\nNow for round 3, what should I consider?\n- Round 1: Both played rock\n- Round 2: I played paper, opponent played scissors\n\nThe opponent seems to be varying their moves. They might try rock next since they haven't won yet, or they might try paper. If they play rock, I should play scissors to get 1 point. If they play paper, I should play rock to get 3 points. If they play scissors again, I should play paper to get 1 point.\n\nSince rock gives me the highest potential reward (3 points), and the opponent might try paper thinking I'll stick with paper, I'll go with rock.",
