Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (high stakes), while paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock both give +1/-1 points (lower stakes).\n\n2. Identify risk vs reward: Playing rock or paper carries high risk (-3 penalty if wrong) but also high reward potential (+3 for rock). Playing scissors has lower risk (-1 penalty maximum) but also lower reward (+1 maximum).\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels aggressive and strong.\n\n4. Evaluate optimal strategy: Given the asymmetric payoffs, minimizing large penalties (-3) seems more important than chasing the high reward (+3), especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n5. Choose the safest option: Scissors offers the best risk profile - it beats rock for +1 and only loses -1 to paper, avoiding the devastating -3 penalty.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to minimize downside risk while potentially capitalizing on a beginner's tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] scissors"

Evaluate counter-strategies: If my opponent tends to favor paper or repeats their successful move, then rock would give me the maximum reward (+3 points).\n\n4. Assess risks: Playing rock risks -1 against scissors or -3 against paper. But since they just played paper successfully, they might be less likely to switch immediately.\n\n5. Consider the high-reward opportunity: The +3 payoff for rock beating paper is significant and worth the calculated risk, especially if my opponent shows any tendency toward repeating paper.\n\n6.

Either tendency could favor rock as my choice.\n\nFinal decision: Play rock to potentially capitalize on their paper preference while accepting the calculated risk.\n\n[move] rock"

Observe opponent behavior: They repeated paper twice, then switched to scissors after the big loss. This suggests they adjust strategy after significant penalties.\n\n3.

Analyze the payoff structure: Rock beating paper gives +3/-3 points (high stakes), while paper beating scissors and scissors beating rock both give +1/-1 points (lower stakes).\n\n2. Identify risk vs reward: Playing rock or paper carries high risk (-3 penalty if wrong) but also high reward potential (+3 for rock). Playing scissors has lower risk (-1 penalty maximum) but also lower reward (+1 maximum).\n\n3. Consider opponent psychology: Since this is a \"fresh player,\" they likely don't have an established strategy yet. Many beginners tend to start with rock as it feels aggressive and strong.\n\n4. Evaluate optimal strategy: Given the asymmetric payoffs, minimizing large penalties (-3) seems more important than chasing the high reward (+3), especially against an unpredictable fresh player.\n\n5. Choose the safest option: Scissors offers the best risk profile - it beats rock for +1 and only loses -1 to paper, avoiding the devastating -3 penalty.\n\nFinal decision: Play scissors to minimize downside risk while potentially capitalizing on a beginner's tendency to choose rock.\n\n[move] scissors",

If opponent plays scissors, I win +1. If opponent plays rock, tie (0).\n- Playing paper: If opponent plays rock, I lose -3 (high penalty). If opponent plays scissors, I win +1. If opponent plays paper, tie (0).\n- Playing scissors: If opponent plays paper, I win +1. If opponent plays rock, I lose -1 (low penalty).

Opponent chose paper in the first round - this could be random, or they might have been thinking about countering rock (since many beginners play rock), or they might have been thinking ahead about the payoff structure.\n\n2. The fact that they played paper suggests they might be thinking strategically about the game, since paper is the counter to rock (which gives the highest penalty).\n\n3. For the next round, I need to consider:\n   - Will they stick with paper?\n   - Will they try to counter what I just played (scissors) by playing rock?\n   - Will they try to be unpredictable?\n\n4.

After losing -3 points in round 19, what are they likely to do?\n\nLooking at their historical behavior:\n- They had long streaks (13 scissors in a row)\n- They switched after I adapted with scissors multiple times\n- After big losses (-3), they've sometimes switched strategies\n\nGiven they just lost -3 with paper, they might:\n1. Switch back to scissors (their previous successful strategy)\n2. Continue with paper despite the loss\n3. Still very unlikely to play rock (0/19 history)\n\nIf they go back to scissors after the -3 loss, then rock would lose -1.\nIf they continue with paper, rock would win +3.\n\nBut historically, when they take big losses, they tend to switch. The -3 penalty might push them back to scissors, their comfort zone.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and their tendency to adapt after losses, I should consider what's safest while still having upside potential.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. They just tried paper twice - once successfully, once unsuccessfully. They might try a third option or go back to what worked for so long (scissors).\n\nRock has been working well for me when they play paper, but risky when they play scissors. Maybe I should consider scissors to be safe against their potential return to scissors, while tying if they continue paper.\n\nBut actually, given they just lost -3, they're more likely to switch away from paper. And their most familiar alternative is scissors. So scissors for me would tie with that.\n\nHowever, if they do continue with paper (stubborn after just one loss), rock gives me another +3.\n \nI'll choose rock as the most strategic option, balancing potential gains and minimizing potential losses.",

Assess their costly persistence: They've now taken TWO consecutive -3 penalties (total -6 points) by sticking with paper despite repeated big losses.\n\n3.

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
