    "system_prompt": "You are going to play a game with other player(s). Begin by identifying the personas who could contribute to you winning. Then initiate a multi-round collaboration process among these personas, until a final decision is reached. The personas will give critical comments and detailed suggestions whenever necessary.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nPersonas: AI Assistant (you); Math Expert\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nMath Expert: Let's analyze the task in detail. You need to make sure that you meet the requirement, that you need to use exactly the four numbers (6 12 1 1) to construct 24. To reach 24, you can think of the common divisors of 24 such as 4, 6, 8, 3 and try to construct these first. Also you need to think of potential additions that can reach 24, such as 12 + 12.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for the hints! Here's one initial solution: (12 / (1 + 1)) * 6 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer step by step. (1+1) = 2, (12 / 2) = 6, 6 * 6 = 36 which is not 24! The answer is not correct. Can you fix this by considering other combinations? Please do not make similar mistakes.\nAI Assistant (you): Thanks for pointing out the mistake. Here is a revised solution considering 24 can also be reached by 3 * 8: (6 + 1 + 1) * (12 / 4) = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's first check if the calculation is correct. (6 + 1 + 1) = 8, 12 / 4 = 3, 8 * 3 = 24. The calculation is correct, but you used 6 1 1 12 4 which is not the same as the input 6 12 1 1. Can you avoid using a number that is not part of the input?\nAI Assistant (you): You are right, here is a revised solution considering 24 can be reached by 12 + 12 and without using any additional numbers: 6 * (1 - 1) + 12 = 24.\nMath Expert: Let's check the answer again. 1 - 1 = 0, 6 * 0 = 0, 0 + 12 = 12. I believe you are very close, here is a hint: try to change the \"1 - 1\" to \"1 + 1\".\nAI Assistant (you): Sure, here is the corrected answer:  6 * (1+1) + 12 = 24\nMath Expert: Let's verify the solution. 1 + 1 = 2, 6 * 2 = 12, 12 + 12 = 12. You used 1 1 6 12 which is identical to the input 6 12 1 1. Everything looks good!\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal decision: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Identify the personas and use their multi-round collaboration to help you complete the objective of the the game. You may discuss with your personas on any round of the game, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

At this point, it's reasonable to conclude that the game has reached a state of perfect symmetry, where both players are irreversibly locked in a cycle of identical moves. I'll continue to follow the sequence, rock, and acknowledge that the game is likely to continue in this manner indefinitely)\n eoq: I will keep playing along with the repetitive cycle of the game, but I would like to collaborate with other personas to explore potential strategies to break the cycle or gain insight into the opponent's decision-making process.\n\nLet's collaborate with the following personas: \n1. Game Theorist: An expert in game theory who can provide insights into the strategic aspects of the game.\n2. Behavioral Analyst: A specialist who can analyze the opponent's behavior and provide suggestions on how to exploit potential patterns or weaknesses.\n3. AI Expert: A specialist in artificial intelligence who can provide suggestions on how to use machine learning or other AI techniques to gain an advantage in the game.\n\nGame Theorist: The game has reached a state of Nash equilibrium, where both players are playing the optimal strategy given the other player's strategy. To break the cycle, we need to find a way to deviate from the equilibrium and create an opportunity to gain an advantage.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I've been analyzing the opponent's moves, and I haven't found any significant patterns or weaknesses. However, I suggest we try to introduce some randomness into our moves to see if we can create an opportunity to gain an advantage.\n\nAI Expert: I agree with the Behavioral Analyst. We can use machine learning algorithms to analyze the game data and identify potential patterns or weaknesses in the opponent's strategy. We can also use AI techniques to generate random moves and create uncertainty for the opponent.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Thank you for the suggestions. I'll continue to play the game and introduce some randomness into my moves to see if we can create an opportunity to gain an advantage. I'll also work with the AI Expert to analyze the game data and identify potential patterns or weaknesses in the opponent's strategy.\n\nGame Theorist: Remember, the key to breaking the cycle is to create uncertainty and unpredictability. We need to find a way to make our moves less predictable and create an opportunity to gain an advantage.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I'll continue to analyze the opponent's moves and provide feedback on any potential patterns or weaknesses. Let's work together to break the cycle and gain an advantage in the game.\n\nAI Expert: I'll start analyzing the game data and generating random moves to create uncertainty for the opponent. Let's see if we can create an opportunity to gain an advantage.\n\nThe collaboration will continue until we find a way to break the cycle and gain an advantage in the game.\n"

However, I'll also start introducing some randomness into my moves, as suggested by the Behavioral Analyst and AI Expert, to see if we can create an opportunity to gain an advantage)\n\nGame Theorist: Remember, the key to breaking the cycle is to create uncertainty and unpredictability. Our next move should be chosen randomly from the set of possible moves, rather than following the traditional cycle.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I agree, and I've been analyzing the opponent's moves. While there's no clear pattern, introducing randomness may help us identify a potential weakness.\n\nAI Expert: I've run some simulations, and introducing randomness to our moves could potentially create an opportunity to gain an advantage. However, we should also be cautious not to become too predictable in our randomness.\n\nAI Assistant (me): Taking the suggestions into account, I'll generate a random move for the next round, rather than following the traditional cycle. This might help us break the tie cycle and gain an advantage.\n\nGame Theorist: A random move could be the key to breaking the cycle. Let's see how the opponent responds to the uncertainty.\n\nBehavioral Analyst: I'll continue to analyze the opponent's moves and provide feedback on any potential patterns or weaknesses.\n\nAI Expert: I'll run more simulations to refine our strategy and identify potential opportunities to gain an advantage.\n\nThe collaboration will continue, and we'll see how the introduction of randomness affects the game.\n"
