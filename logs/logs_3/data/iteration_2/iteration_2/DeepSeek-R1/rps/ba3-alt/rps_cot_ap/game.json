      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out the best move here. The user mentioned that I'm playing against a fresh player. New players often have certain tendencies. From what I've heard, many beginners tend to choose rock first because it's seen as strong or straightforward. So if the opponent is a new player, maybe they'll go with rock.\n\nLooking at the game rules, if I choose paper when they choose rock, I get 3 points, which is the highest reward here. That's a good incentive. But wait, what if they don't pick rock? If they choose randomly, each move has an equal chance. Let's calculate the expected value for each possible move.\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If they pick rock, I win 3 points.\n- If they pick paper, it's a tie (0).\n- If they pick scissors, I lose 1 point.\nAssuming equal probability (1/3 chance each), the expected value is (3 + 0 -1)/3 \u2248 0.67.\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If they pick rock, tie (0).\n- If they pick paper, I lose 3.\n- If they pick scissors, I win 1.\nExpected value: (0 -3 +1)/3 \u2248 -0.67.\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If they pick rock, I lose 1.\n- If they pick paper, I win 1.\n- If they pick scissors, tie (0).\nExpected value: (-1 +1 +0)/3 = 0.\n\nSo paper has the highest expected value here. Plus, considering the new player's possible bias towards rock, choosing paper maximizes both the potential gain and the expected value. Even if they don't pick rock, the expected value is still better than the other options. Therefore, paper seems like the best move.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Last round, I thought the new player might choose rock, so I went with paper. But they actually chose paper too, resulting in a tie. Hmm, maybe they didn't go with the common first move of rock. Or perhaps they thought I would expect rock and chose paper to counter.\n\nNow, for the next round, I need to adjust my strategy. Since they picked paper last time, maybe they'll switch. What's the common pattern after a tie? Some players might stick with the same move, others might switch. If they think I'll stay with paper again, they might go for scissors to beat it. But if they think I'll switch, maybe they'll choose rock. Alternatively, they might just choose randomly.\n\nLooking at the payoff matrix, if I choose scissors and they choose paper, I get +1. If I choose rock and they choose scissors, I get +1. If I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3. But since they just played paper, maybe they'll expect me to stay with paper again. So they might go for scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. Wait, but rock loses to paper. Wait, no: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. So if they go scissors, I should choose rock. But if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll stay with paper again. Or maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors if they think I'll switch to scissors. This is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since they tied with paper last time, maybe they'll stick with paper again, thinking I might switch. If I choose scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they switch to rock, scissors would lose. Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to consider that new players might not have a set pattern yet. After a tie with paper, they might either repeat or switch. If I go with scissors, I can beat their paper if they repeat, but lose if they switch to rock. If I go with rock, I can beat their scissors if they switch, but lose if they go paper again. If I go paper again, I tie if they repeat, but lose if they switch to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is more likely to switch after a tie. So if they had paper last time, they might switch to scissors or rock. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors and lose to paper. If they switch to scissors, rock wins. If they switch to rock, then it's a tie. If they stay with paper, I lose. Hmm. Alternatively, choosing scissors would beat paper if they stay, lose to rock if they switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is trying to predict my move. Since I chose paper last time and tied, they might expect me to switch. If they think I'll switch to scissors to beat their paper, they might stay with paper to beat my scissors. Wait, no. If I switch to scissors, they stay with paper, then scissors beats paper. So if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might choose rock to beat my scissors. But that's getting too meta. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to choose rock. If they switch to scissors, I win. If they switch to rock, it's a tie. If they stay with paper, I lose. But since they just played paper, maybe they're more likely to switch. But I don't have enough data. \n\nAlternatively, since the previous move was paper, and the game is new, maybe they'll try to cycle through. So after paper, they might go scissors next. If I choose rock, I can beat scissors. But if they go rock, it's a tie. If they go paper again, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best bet is to choose scissors. If they stay with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, it's a tie. \n\nHmm. Considering all possibilities, maybe the best approach is to go with scissors, expecting them to repeat paper. But since they tied last time, maybe they think I'll stay with paper and they'll try to beat it with scissors. In that case, I should choose rock to beat their scissors. Wait, but if they choose scissors, rock beats it. If they choose scissors, and I choose rock, I get +1. If they choose paper again, and I choose rock, I lose -3. That's a big risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch to scissors, so they choose rock. Then I should choose paper. But that's getting too deep. \n\nAlternatively, since the first move was paper, and they tied, maybe they'll switch to rock to beat my possible scissors. If I choose paper again, I can beat their rock. But if they switch to scissors, paper loses. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to go with rock. If they switch to scissors, I win. If they stay with paper, I lose. If they switch to rock, tie. But the potential loss is -3, which is worse than the potential gain of +1. Maybe that's too risky. \n\nAlternatively, go with scissors. If they stay with paper, +1. If they switch to rock, -1. If they switch to scissors, 0. The risk here is lower. The maximum loss is -1, whereas with rock, the loss could be -3. So maybe scissors is safer. \n\nAlternatively, since they just played paper, and the game is new, maybe they'll stick with paper again. So scissors would be good. But they might think I'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to choose paper again. If they stay, tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they switch to rock, I win. But the potential for +3 is tempting. \n\nHmm. Considering all possibilities, perhaps the safest move is to go with scissors, expecting them to repeat paper. But given that they tied last time, maybe they'll switch. Alternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper, they might switch to scissors. So I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nBut this is getting too into mind games. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Alternatively, choose scissors expecting them to stay. \n\nAlternatively, since the previous move was paper, and the player is new, they might not have a strong pattern. Maybe they'll choose randomly. In that case, the expected value for each move would be:\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If they choose rock: 0\n- If paper: -3\n- If scissors: +1\nAssuming equal probability, expected value is (0 + (-3) +1)/3 = -2/3 \u2248 -0.666\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If rock: +3\n- If paper: 0\n- If scissors: -1\nExpected value: (3 +0 -1)/3 \u2248 0.666\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If rock: -1\n- If paper: +1\n- If scissors: 0\nExpected value: (-1 +1 +0)/3 = 0\n\nSo based on expected value, paper has the highest expected value. But this assumes they choose randomly. However, if they have any tendencies, this changes. Since they just played paper, maybe they are less likely to play paper again. If they avoid paper, then the expected values change. For example, if they choose between rock and scissors with equal probability:\n\nIf I choose paper:\n- If they choose rock: +3 (50%)\n- If scissors: -1 (50%)\nExpected value: (3 -1)/2 = 1\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n- If rock: -1 (50%)\n- If scissors: 0 (50%)\nExpected value: (-1 +0)/2 = -0.5\n\nIf I choose rock:\n- If rock: 0 (50%)\n- If scissors: +1 (50%)\nExpected value: (0 +1)/2 = 0.5\n\nSo in that case, paper still has the highest expected value. But this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the player is more likely to switch to rock after paper, thinking that I might choose scissors. So if they choose rock, and I choose paper, I get +3. That's a good outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll stay with paper, they might choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut without knowing their strategy, it's hard. Given that they are a new player, maybe they are more likely to switch moves. So after paper, they might switch to rock or scissors. If I choose paper again, I can beat rock but lose to scissors. If I choose scissors, I beat paper but lose to rock. If I choose rock, I beat scissors but lose to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to choose paper again, hoping they switch to rock. The potential +3 is worth the risk of -1 if they choose scissors. \n\nAlternatively, considering the previous tie, they might think I'll stick with paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Given that, perhaps the best move is to go with paper again, hoping they switch to rock. The high reward of +3 is tempting, and the risk is -1 if they choose scissors. Alternatively, if they stay with paper, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch to scissors to beat my paper. So I should choose rock. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best approach is to go with paper again, considering the expected value when assuming random play. \n\nWait, but in the first round, they chose paper. If they are a new player, maybe they have a tendency to choose paper again. Or maybe they think I'll switch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest move is scissors. If they stay with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. \n\nBut given the previous move was paper, and they are new, maybe they'll stick with paper. So scissors would be good. \n\nBut in the first round, they tied with paper. Maybe they think I'll switch, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nThis is really a lot of possibilities. Maybe I should go with rock to counter a possible scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since the previous move was paper, and they are new, they might cycle to the next move, which is scissors. So scissors would be their next move. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut how do new players cycle? Some might not cycle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to choose scissors, expecting them to stay with paper. \n\nBut given that they tied last time, they might think I'll stay with paper, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nHmm. I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the best approach is to choose rock, expecting them to switch to scissors. Alternatively, choose scissors to beat their possible paper. \n\nAlternatively, since the previous move was paper, and they are new, they might choose rock next. So I should choose paper again. \n\nBut this is all guesswork. Without more data, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, if I choose paper and they choose rock, I get +3. If they choose scissors, I get -1. If they choose paper, 0. The potential for +3 is higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, and they choose paper, +1. If they choose rock, -1. If they choose scissors, 0. \n\nThe risk with paper is higher but the reward is higher. \n\nGiven that, maybe it's worth taking the risk and choosing paper again, hoping they switch to rock. \n\nBut in the first round, they chose paper. Maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they think I'll switch, so they choose scissors. Then I should choose rock. \n\nBut I don't know. \n\nIn the end, I'll go with rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their paper. If they do, I win. If they choose paper again, I lose. If they choose rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe scissors is better. \n\nWait, if they choose scissors, and I choose rock, I win. If they choose paper again, scissors would lose. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is scissors. If they stay with paper, I win. If they switch to rock, I lose. If they switch to scissors, tie. \n\nBut given that they tied with paper, maybe they'll switch. \n\nI think I'll go with rock.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what move to make next. Let's recap the previous rounds. \n\nFirst round: I chose paper, thinking the new player would pick rock. But they also chose paper, so it was a tie.\n\nSecond round: I switched to rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their previous paper. But again, they chose rock, leading to another tie.\n\nHmm, maybe the opponent is also trying to predict my moves. Let's analyze their possible strategy. \n\nIn the first round, they picked paper. When I chose paper, they tied. Then in the second round, I chose rock, expecting them to go scissors, but they stuck with rock. Maybe they're not switching as much as I thought. Or perhaps they're using a different pattern.\n\nSince the last two moves were paper and rock from them, maybe they'll try scissors next, thinking I might expect another repeat. Alternatively, they might stick with rock again, trying to counter my possible expectation of them switching.\n\nWait, the scoring system: paper beats scissors (1/-1), rock beats paper (3/-3), scissors beat rock (1/-1). So rock gives higher rewards but also higher penalties. \n\nIf they've chosen paper and then rock, maybe they're alternating? Or maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy first move was paper, they also did paper. Then I did rock, they did rock. So they mirrored my moves both times. If that's the case, maybe they're mirroring my previous move. So if I did rock last time, they might do rock again. But that led to a tie. Alternatively, if they're mirroring, maybe they expect me to switch, so they might change. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my strategy. Since I chose paper then rock, they might expect me to choose scissors next, following the pattern (paper, rock, scissors). If that's the case, they might pick rock to beat scissors. But I need to counter that. \n\nWait, if they think I'll go scissors, they might pick rock. So I should pick paper to beat their rock. But if they're sticking to the same pattern of mirroring, they might pick rock again. So if I choose paper, and they choose rock, I get +3. If they choose scissors, I lose -1. If they choose paper again, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through the moves. First paper, then rock, next scissors. If that's the case, they'll pick scissors, so I should pick rock to beat scissors. Wait, no: scissors beat rock. So if they pick scissors, I should pick rock, but that would lose. Wait, scissors beat rock, so if they pick scissors and I pick rock, they get +1, I get -1. So that's bad. \n\nAlternatively, if they cycle paper -> rock -> scissors, then next is scissors, so I should pick rock to lose, which is bad. Alternatively, if they're cycling, maybe I should pick scissors to beat their expected paper, but they just did rock. Hmm, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, since the last two were paper and rock, maybe they'll go for scissors to complete the cycle. If they do scissors, then I should pick rock, but that would lose. Wait, no: scissors beat rock. So if they pick scissors, I should pick scissors to tie, or paper to lose. Wait, no: paper beats scissors. So if they pick scissors, I should pick paper to win. \n\nWait, let me get the rules straight again:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: +1 for me, -1 for them.\n- Rock beats paper: +3 for me, -3 for them.\n- Scissors beat rock: +1 for me, -1 for them.\n\nSo if I expect them to pick scissors, I should pick paper. If I expect them to pick rock, I should pick paper. If I expect them to pick paper, I should pick scissors. \n\nBut given their previous moves: paper, then rock. What's the pattern? Maybe they're alternating between paper and rock. So next move could be paper again. If that's the case, I should pick scissors. But if they're alternating, paper -> rock -> paper, then next is paper. So scissors would beat that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're sticking with rock again. If they chose rock twice in a row, maybe they'll do it again. Then I should pick paper. \n\nBut how to decide? Let's think about their possible strategies. Since they're a new player, maybe they're not following a strict pattern. Maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. \n\nIn the first round, I chose paper, they chose paper. Second round, I chose rock, they chose rock. So they mirrored my moves. If that's the case, then in the third round, if I choose scissors, they might choose scissors. But if I choose paper, they choose paper. But that's leading to ties. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my previous move. For example, if I chose rock last time, they might choose paper next to beat my rock. Wait, but in the second round, I chose rock, and they chose rock. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they switch to the move that would have beaten their last move. For example, first they chose paper. To beat paper, they would need to choose scissors next. But they chose rock. Then, to beat rock, they would choose paper. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're randomly choosing. But given that they mirrored my moves twice, maybe they're doing that intentionally. So if I choose scissors now, they choose scissors, leading to a tie. If I choose paper, they choose paper. If I choose rock, they choose rock. \n\nBut that's leading to all ties, which isn't helpful. So perhaps I need to break the pattern. If they're mirroring me, then I can choose a move that beats my previous move. For example, last time I chose rock. The move that beats rock is paper. So if I choose paper, and they mirror, they would choose paper, leading to a tie. But if they instead choose the move that beats my previous move (rock), they would choose paper. So if I choose scissors, which beats paper, then if they choose paper, I win. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model possible scenarios:\n\nIf they are mirroring my moves (copying what I did last), then:\n\nRound 1: I chose paper, they chose paper.\n\nRound 2: I chose rock, they chose rock.\n\nRound 3: If I choose scissors, they choose scissors \u2192 tie.\n\nIf I choose paper, they choose paper \u2192 tie.\n\nIf I choose rock, they choose rock \u2192 tie.\n\nBut that's not helpful. So maybe they're not mirroring, but trying something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a 'tit-for-tat' strategy, where they do what I did last. But that's the same as mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my last move. For example, if I chose rock last time, they choose paper this time to beat it. But in round 2, I chose rock, and they chose rock, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between their own previous moves. First paper, then rock, then scissors, then paper, etc. So if they did paper, then rock, next would be scissors. If that's the case, I should choose rock to beat scissors. Wait, no: scissors beat rock. So if they choose scissors, I should choose scissors to tie, or paper to win. \n\nWait, if they choose scissors, and I choose paper, I win +1. If they choose scissors and I choose rock, I lose -1. So better to choose paper if expecting scissors. \n\nBut how confident am I that they'll choose scissors? If their pattern is paper \u2192 rock \u2192 scissors, then yes. But if they're just alternating between paper and rock, then next would be paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that choosing the same move leads to a tie, so they might switch. After two ties, they might try a different move. \n\nAlternatively, considering the scoring, rock gives higher rewards. If they're trying to maximize their points, they might prefer rock to get +3 if they beat paper. But in the last round, they chose rock, which tied with mine. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should try to exploit the scoring system. Since rock gives higher rewards, maybe they're more likely to choose rock again. If I choose paper, I can beat rock and get +3. But if they switch to scissors, I lose -1. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll expect them to choose rock again, they might switch to paper, which would beat my rock. Wait, but I'm choosing paper. If they choose paper, it's a tie. If they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, I win. \n\nWait, if I choose paper:\n\n- They choose paper \u2192 tie (0)\n- They choose rock \u2192 I win (+3)\n- They choose scissors \u2192 I lose (-1)\n\nSo the possible outcomes are +3, 0, or -1.\n\nIf I choose scissors:\n\n- They choose paper \u2192 I win (+1)\n- They choose rock \u2192 I lose (-1)\n- They choose scissors \u2192 tie (0)\n\nIf I choose rock:\n\n- They choose paper \u2192 I lose (-3)\n- They choose rock \u2192 tie (0)\n- They choose scissors \u2192 I win (+1)\n\nGiven the higher risk of losing -3 if I choose rock and they choose paper, maybe rock is riskier. \n\nIf I choose paper, the worst case is -1, best +3. If I choose scissors, worst -1, best +1. If I choose rock, worst -3, best +1. \n\nSo paper has the highest potential reward (+3) and a moderate risk (-1). Maybe it's worth taking that risk, especially if I think they might stick with rock again. \n\nBut they chose rock last time, and the time before that, paper. Maybe they're alternating. So paper \u2192 rock \u2192 paper. If that's the case, next would be paper. So I should choose scissors to beat paper. \n\nBut if they're alternating, then after paper and rock, next is paper. So scissors would beat that. But if they're not alternating, maybe they're sticking with rock. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed that choosing the same move leads to a tie, so they might switch. After two ties, they might try a different move. \n\nAlternatively, since they tied twice, they might try to go for a higher reward by choosing rock again, hoping I choose scissors. If they choose rock, and I choose paper, I get +3. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with paper again, expecting them to choose rock. But they might expect that and choose scissors instead. \n\nAlternatively, since I chose rock last time, they might expect me to choose scissors next (following the cycle), so they choose rock to beat scissors. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll try to break the tie by changing their move. Since they chose rock last time, they might switch to paper or scissors. \n\nIf they switch to paper, I should choose scissors. If they switch to scissors, I should choose paper. If they stay with rock, I should choose paper. \n\nBut how to decide? Maybe the safest bet is to choose paper, which covers the possibility of them staying with rock or switching to paper (leading to a tie). If they switch to scissors, I lose, but that's a lower penalty (-1) compared to the potential gain (+3). \n\nAlternatively, if I choose scissors, I can beat their possible switch to paper, but if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nGiven the higher reward for paper beating rock, and the moderate risk, maybe paper is the better choice. \n\nSo, final decision: choose paper.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last round I won by playing scissors against their rock. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, no, the user said I made scissors and the opponent made rock, which means scissors loses to rock. But the message says I won and scored 1 point. That must be a mistake in the game's logic. Wait, according to the rules, scissors beats rock, giving the winner 1 point. So if I played scissors and they played rock, scissors beats rock, so I should win. But in reality, rock crushes scissors, so maybe the game has a different rule setup. Wait, the user's initial description says:\n\n- paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1)\n- rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3)\n- scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1)\n\nSo according to that, scissors does beat rock. So in the last round, I played scissors, they played rock, so I won. That's correct. Now, the next move. They played rock last time, and I beat them with scissors. Now, what would they do next? If they lost with rock, maybe they'll switch. If they were using rock and lost, they might think to switch to paper to beat my scissors. Because if I keep playing scissors, they can switch to paper to beat me. But wait, if they expect me to stay with scissors, they might go paper. But if I anticipate that, I should play scissors again? Wait, no. If they switch to paper, then I should play scissors to beat their paper. Wait, no. Wait, paper beats scissors. So if they play paper, and I play scissors, they would win. Wait, no, according to the rules, paper beats scissors, so if they play paper and I play scissors, they get +1, I get -1. So if they think I'll play scissors again, they might play paper. To counter that, I should play rock, which beats paper. Because rock beats paper, giving me +3. So maybe I should switch to rock this time. Alternatively, they might think I'll switch to rock, so they might play scissors to beat my rock. But scissors beats rock, so if I play rock and they play scissors, I lose. Hmm. This is a bit of a mind game. Let's recap the previous moves:\n\nRound 1: Both played paper. Tie.\nRound 2: Both played rock. Tie.\nRound 3: I played scissors, they played rock. I won (scissors beats rock).\nNow, Round 4. They played rock last time and lost. They might switch. If they think I'll repeat scissors, they might play paper. So I should play rock to beat paper. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they might play paper again. Wait, no. If they lost with rock, they might switch to paper to beat scissors. But since I just beat their rock with scissors, they might expect me to play scissors again, so they play paper. Therefore, I should play rock to beat their expected paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll anticipate that and play scissors again, so they stick with rock. But that's getting too deep. Maybe a simpler approach: since they lost with rock, they might switch to paper. So I play rock. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. Wait, but I just played scissors. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the opponent is following a pattern. Let's see their moves so far:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: rock\nWait, no. The first round, both played paper. Second round, both played rock. Third round, opponent played rock, I played scissors. So their moves were paper, rock, rock. Now, after losing with rock, will they switch? Maybe they'll switch to paper. So I should play rock. Alternatively, they might switch to scissors to beat my expected paper. But I just played scissors, so if they think I'll switch to paper, they might play scissors. But I need to predict their next move based on their previous behavior. Since they played rock twice in a row (rounds 2 and 3), and lost once, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, I should play rock. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock as well (since rock loses to scissors). Wait, no. Scissors beats rock. So if they play scissors, and I play rock, I lose. So if I think they'll switch to scissors, I should play paper. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll switch to paper after losing with rock, so I play rock. Alternatively, if they stick with rock again, I should play paper. But they just lost with rock, so maybe they'll change. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to switch to paper, so they play scissors. Hmm. This is a classic game theory problem. Maybe the optimal strategy is to randomize, but since I'm trying to outguess them, I need to find a pattern. Let's think: they started with paper, then rock, then rock. After two rocks, and a loss, they might try paper again. So I'll go with rock to beat paper. Alternatively, if they go back to paper, which they did in round 1, maybe they cycle. So paper, rock, rock, paper. So next move is paper. Therefore, rock. So I'll choose rock.\n",

Let's see:\n\nAfter I won with scissors against their rock, maybe they thought I would switch to paper to beat their rock, so they might choose scissors next. But in the next round, I chose rock again, and they also chose rock. So perhaps they're not reacting to my previous move but sticking to a pattern. Alternatively, they might be trying to predict my moves based on my history.\n\nMy moves so far: paper, rock, scissors, rock. Their moves: paper, rock, rock, rock. So they've chosen rock three times in a row after the initial paper. Maybe they're sticking with rock now. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock and get +3 points. But wait, in the last round, I chose rock again, and they also chose rock. Maybe they expect me to switch to paper, so they might choose scissors to beat my paper. But if they keep choosing rock, then paper is the best choice. Alternatively, they might switch to paper expecting me to choose rock again. Let me think.\n\nIf they've chosen rock three times, maybe they'll switch. Or maybe they're sticking with it. If I choose paper, I can beat rock. If they switch to scissors, I lose. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. But given their history, they might stick with rock. Alternatively, they might think I expect them to switch and counter that. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should go with paper again, hoping they stay on rock. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper, they might go scissors, so I should choose rock. But rock loses to paper. Wait, no. Rock beats scissors. Wait, the rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors (win +1, lose -1)\n- Rock beats paper (win +3, lose -3)\n- Scissors beats rock (win +1, lose -1)\n\nSo if I choose paper, and they choose scissors, I win. If they choose rock, I lose. Wait, no. Wait, paper beats scissors. Rock beats paper. Scissors beats rock. So if I choose paper, and they choose rock, they win. If they choose scissors, I win. If they choose paper, tie.\n\nSo if they've been choosing rock a lot, then paper would lose to their rock. Wait, no. Rock beats paper. So if they choose rock, and I choose paper, they get +3, I get -3. That's bad. Wait, I need to correct that. Wait, the rules:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: so if I play paper and they play scissors, I win +1, they lose -1.\n- Rock beats paper: if I play rock and they play paper, I win +3, they lose -3.\n- Scissors beats rock: if I play scissors and they play rock, I win +1, they lose -1.\n\nSo if they are playing rock, the best move to beat rock is scissors. Because scissors beats rock. So if they keep choosing rock, I should choose scissors. But in the third round, I did choose scissors and they chose rock, so I won. Then in the fourth round, I chose rock again, and they also chose rock. So maybe they are sticking with rock. If they keep choosing rock, then I should choose scissors again. But maybe they expect that and switch to paper. Wait, if they choose paper, then scissors would lose to paper. Wait, no. Paper beats scissors. So if they choose paper, and I choose scissors, they win. If they choose rock, and I choose scissors, I win. If they choose scissors, and I choose scissors, tie.\n\nSo if they've been choosing rock, maybe they'll continue. But after I beat them with scissors, they might switch to paper to beat my scissors. But in the next round, I chose rock, and they chose rock again. So maybe they didn't switch. Alternatively, they might be random. But given the history, they have chosen rock three times. Maybe they're a rock-heavy player. So to counter rock, I should choose scissors. But if they switch to paper, scissors loses. Alternatively, if they think I'll choose scissors again, they might choose paper, so I should choose rock to beat their paper. But this is getting into a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to mirror my previous move. Let's see:\n\nMy previous move was rock. Their previous move was rock. So if they mirror, they might expect me to play rock again, so they play paper. If I think they'll play paper, I should play scissors to beat their paper. But if they are mirroring, then they would play what I played last. I last played rock, so they play rock again. Wait, but in the last round, I played rock, they played rock. If they mirror, they would play the same as my last move. So if I played rock last, they play rock again. Then I should play paper to beat their rock. Wait, no. Rock beats paper. So if I play paper against their rock, they win. That's bad. Wait, no. Rock beats paper, so if they play rock and I play paper, they get +3, I get -3. That's worse. So to beat rock, I need to play scissors. So if they are playing rock again, I should play scissors. But if they are switching to paper expecting me to play scissors, then I should play rock. This is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a pattern. Let's list their moves:\n\nRound 1: paper\nRound 2: rock\nRound 3: rock\nRound 4: rock\n\nSo after the first two rounds, they've stuck with rock. Maybe they are trying to play rock consistently. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat rock. But in the third round, I did that and won. Then in the fourth round, I played rock again, and they played rock again. So maybe they are not changing. So perhaps they are sticking with rock. If I play scissors again, I can win. But they might expect that and switch to paper. Alternatively, they might not be adapting. Given that they've played rock three times in a row, it's possible they are a rock player. So I should choose scissors. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they continue with rock, I win. Let's take the risk. Alternatively, maybe they are alternating. But their moves don't show that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since they tied when I played rock twice, maybe they think I'll switch to paper. So they might play scissors to beat my paper. If I play rock, then I beat their scissors. Wait, scissors beats rock. No, scissors loses to rock. Wait, scissors beats rock. Wait, no. According to the rules:\n\n- Scissors beats rock: winner gets +1, loser -1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\n- Paper beats scissors: paper wins, scissors loses.\n- Rock beats paper: rock wins, paper loses.\n- Scissors beats rock: scissors wins, rock loses.\n\nSo scissors beats rock. So if I play rock and they play scissors, I lose. If I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If I play paper and they play rock, they win. So to beat rock, I need scissors. To beat scissors, I need paper. To beat paper, I need rock.\n\nSo if they are playing rock, I should play scissors. If they switch to paper, I should play rock. If they switch to scissors, I should play paper.\n\nGiven their recent history of rock, maybe they'll stick with it. So I'll go with scissors again. But in the last round when I played rock, they also played rock. So maybe they are not changing. So scissors would be the move. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors again, they might play paper, so I should play rock. But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best bet is to assume they'll stick with rock and play scissors. Alternatively, if they are trying to counter my previous move. My last move was rock. If they think I'll play rock again, they might play paper. So I should play scissors to beat their paper. Wait, scissors beats paper? No, paper beats scissors. Wait, no. Paper beats scissors. So if they play paper, and I play scissors, they win. So if I think they'll play paper, I should play rock to beat their paper. But how do I predict that?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns. Their moves: paper, rock, rock, rock. So after the first tie with paper, they switched to rock and stuck with it. Maybe they are a rock player. So scissors is the way to go. Let's try scissors again.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The last few rounds have been a bit tricky. Let me recap what's happened so far to figure out the best move.\n\nFirst round: I chose paper, thinking the new player might start with rock. They also chose paper, so it was a tie. Then in the next round, I picked rock, expecting them to switch to scissors after their previous paper. But they chose rock again, another tie. Third round, I went with scissors, anticipating they might switch to paper. They chose rock, so I won that round with scissors beating rock. Then I tried rock again, thinking they might switch to paper after losing with rock, but they stuck with rock, leading to another tie. Next, I chose scissors, predicting they'd keep using rock, but they chose scissors too, another tie.\n\nNow, looking at the pattern, the opponent has chosen rock three times (rounds 2, 4, and 5) and paper once (round 1), scissors once (round 6). They seem to favor rock, but after the last tie with scissors, maybe they'll switch. If they notice that I've been trying to counter their rock with scissors, they might switch to paper to beat my scissors. Alternatively, they might stick with scissors again, expecting me to choose rock. But given their history, they might go back to rock. Hmm.\n\nIf I think they'll switch to paper, then scissors would lose to paper, so I should choose rock. If they stick with scissors, then rock would beat scissors. But if they go back to rock, then paper would beat rock. Wait, but in the last round, both chose scissors. So maybe they'll try to break the tie by changing. If they went from scissors to paper, then I should choose scissors again to beat paper. But if they think I'll stay with scissors, they might choose rock. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: rock beats paper for 3 points, which is a higher reward. Maybe the opponent is trying to maximize their points by using rock more often. If that's the case, then paper would be a good choice to counter. But they might also be aware that I might expect that and switch to scissors. It's a bit of a loop.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the safest bet is to go with paper. If they stick with rock, paper wins. If they switch to paper, it's a tie. If they go scissors, I lose but only give up 1 point. Alternatively, choosing rock could either tie with their rock, beat their scissors, or lose to paper. But since they've used scissors once, maybe they'll go back. Hmm. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper after their scissors, they might choose scissors again to beat my paper. But I just chose scissors last time, so maybe they expect me to change.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern. Their moves so far: paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors, scissors. Wait, no, let me check again. Round 1: opponent paper. Round 2: opponent rock. Round 3: opponent rock. Round 4: opponent rock. Round 5: opponent scissors. Round 6: opponent scissors. So they've used rock three times in a row, then scissors twice. Maybe they're alternating or trying to find a pattern. If they used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to paper next. If I choose scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they go back to rock, scissors would lose. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my moves. When I chose scissors and won, they might expect me to choose scissors again, so they might pick rock. If I choose paper, I can beat their rock. But if they think I'll switch to paper, they might choose scissors. It's a classic rock-paper-scissors dilemma.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to randomize, but since I need to make a decision, I'll go with paper. It covers the possibility they might go back to rock, which they've used frequently, and if they choose paper again, it's a tie. If they choose scissors, I lose but it's a lower penalty. Alternatively, if they stick with scissors, I lose, but maybe they'll switch. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to choose paper to counter their possible rock, so they'll choose scissors. In that case, I should choose rock. But then if they choose paper, I lose. This is tricky.\n\nWait, considering the last two moves were scissors from both of us. If they think I'll switch to rock to beat scissors, they might choose paper. So if I choose scissors again, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they choose rock, I lose. Hmm. Maybe scissors is a risky move here. Alternatively, choosing rock could beat their scissors if they repeat, but lose to paper. Given that they've used scissors twice, maybe they'll switch. I'm not sure. Maybe the best move is to go with paper, expecting them to possibly revert to rock. Let's try that.\n",

But maybe they'll switch to rock to beat scissors, expecting me to go for scissors. Wait, no, if they were using scissors and lost, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors. But I just used paper, so if they think I'll repeat paper, they might go for scissors again. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll try to counter my previous move. Since I played paper and won, they might expect me to play paper again and choose scissors. But if I switch to rock, I can beat their scissors. Wait, but rock beats scissors, right? Wait, no, scissors beat paper, rock beats scissors, paper beats rock. So if they think I'll play paper again, they might choose scissors. If I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. But if they think I'm switching to rock, they might play paper. This is a bit of a mind game.\n\nLooking at the history: the last few moves were paper (tie), then rock (tie), then scissors (I won), then rock (tie), scissors (tie), paper (I won). The opponent's moves were paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors. Wait, no, let me check again. The first round was both paper. Then both rock. Then I played scissors and they played rock, so I lost. Wait, no, the user said I won that round with scissors against their rock? Wait, no, in the third round, the user said I made scissors and the opponent made rock, so I lost. But according to the rules, scissors lose to rock. Wait, the user said \"You won the round. You made the move: scissors. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored 1 points.\" Wait, that's conflicting. Because according to the rules, rock beats scissors, so the opponent should have won. Maybe there was a mistake in the user's message. But assuming the user's messages are correct, even if they contradict the rules, I have to go with what they say. So in that case, when I played scissors and they played rock, I won. That's odd, but maybe the user has different rules. Wait, let me check the initial game description again.\n\nOriginal rules: paper beats scissors (winner +1, loser -1), rock beats paper (winner +3, loser -3), scissors beats rock (winner +1, loser -1). So scissors beats rock. So if I play scissors and they play rock, I win. That's correct. So in that case, when I played scissors against their rock, I won. So the rules are different from standard. So scissors beats rock, rock beats paper, paper beats scissors. So the cycle is scissors > rock > paper > scissors. So in that case, when I played scissors against their rock, I won. Got it.\n\nSo the opponent's recent moves: in the last round, they played scissors against my paper, so I won. Now, they might think I'll stick with paper again, so they might play scissors again. If I play rock, rock beats scissors (since rock beats paper, but scissors beats rock? Wait, no. Wait, according to the rules: scissors beats rock. So if I play rock and they play scissors, they would win. Wait, no. Let me recheck the rules:\n\n- paper beats scissors: paper wins, +1 for paper, -1 for scissors.\n- rock beats paper: rock wins, +3 for rock, -3 for paper.\n- scissors beats rock: scissors wins, +1 for scissors, -1 for rock.\n\nSo the hierarchy is: paper > scissors, rock > paper, scissors > rock. So the cycle is paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock, rock beats paper. So if I play rock and they play scissors, scissors beats rock, so they win. If I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If I play paper and they play scissors, I win. If they play paper and I play rock, I win. So in the last round, I played paper, they played scissors, so I won. Now, they might expect me to play paper again, so they might play scissors again. If I play paper again, it's a tie. If I play rock, rock beats paper, but they might not play paper. Alternatively, they might switch to rock to beat my scissors if they think I'll switch. But given that they just lost with scissors against my paper, maybe they'll switch to rock to try to beat scissors. But if I play paper again, and they switch to rock, then rock beats paper, so they get +3. That's risky. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch from paper to something else, maybe they'll play paper to counter rock. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll stick with scissors, thinking I'll stay with paper. But since they lost with scissors last time, maybe they'll switch. It's hard to predict. Maybe a good strategy is to alternate. Since I just played paper and won, maybe they expect me to play paper again, so they might play scissors again. If I play paper again, it's a tie. If I play rock, and they play scissors, they win. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, if they switch to rock, then scissors would beat their rock. Wait, if I play scissors and they play rock, I win. If they play scissors, it's a tie. If they play paper, I lose. Hmm. Maybe the best move is to play scissors, expecting them to either stick with scissors (tie) or switch to rock (I win). Alternatively, if they switch to paper, I lose. But since they just played scissors and lost, maybe they'll switch to rock. So playing scissors could be good. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, then I should play rock. But I don't know. Maybe a safe move is to play rock, which would beat paper if they switch to paper. But if they play scissors, I lose. It's a gamble. Alternatively, since the last two times they played scissors, maybe they'll switch. Let me think. The opponent's moves so far: Round 1: paper (tie), Round 2: rock (tie), Round 3: rock (I played scissors, they played rock, I won), Round 4: rock (tie), Round 5: scissors (tie), Round 6: scissors (I played paper, they played scissors, I won). So their moves: paper, rock, rock, rock, scissors, scissors. So they played scissors twice in a row. Now, after losing with scissors, maybe they'll switch. If they switch to rock, then I should play scissors. If they switch to paper, I should play rock. But predicting their next move is tricky. Maybe they'll go back to paper. Alternatively, they might think I'll expect them to switch to rock, so they play paper. It's a bit of a guessing game. Given that they've been sticking with scissors, maybe they'll try scissors again. If I play paper again, it's a tie. If I play rock, and they play scissors, they win. If I play scissors, and they play scissors, it's a tie. Alternatively, maybe they'll switch to paper, so I should play rock. But there's no clear pattern. Maybe the best bet is to play rock, expecting them to switch to paper. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they've been using scissors twice, maybe they'll switch to rock. If I play paper, I can beat rock. Wait, no: rock beats paper. So if they play rock, and I play paper, they get +3. That's bad. So maybe I should play scissors to beat their possible rock. But if they play paper, scissors lose. Hmm. This is complicated. Maybe the safest move is to play scissors, which would either tie if they play scissors again or win if they switch to rock. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given their recent pattern, maybe they'll stick with scissors. Alternatively, they might think I'll play paper again, so they play scissors again, leading to a tie. But I just won with paper against their scissors, so maybe they'll avoid scissors. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should vary my move. Let's try scissors.\n",

Rock (I lost with paper)\n8. Rock (I won with scissors)\n9. Scissors (I won with paper)\n10. Rock (I lost with paper)\n11. Rock (I won with scissors)\n12. Rock (I won with scissors)\n\nWait, maybe the opponent is favoring rock. If they are choosing rock frequently, then choosing paper would be good. But when I chose paper before, they sometimes chose scissors. So maybe they switch to scissors when I choose paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a counter-strategy. If I beat their rock with scissors, they might switch to paper next. But if I expect that, I should choose rock. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to assume they'll continue with rock, so I should choose paper. But given that the last time I chose paper, they chose scissors, maybe they are predicting that. So perhaps I should choose rock to beat their scissors. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been choosing rock a lot, maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my expected scissors. If I choose scissors, expecting their paper, but if they choose rock, I lose. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are random. In that case, the best strategy is to choose the move that maximizes expected value. Let's calculate the expected points based on their possible moves.\n\nAssuming the opponent's move probabilities based on history:\n\nLooking at their moves so far:\n\nTotal moves (from the rounds described):\n\n- Paper: 1 (round 1)\n- Rock: 6 (rounds 2,3,4,7,8,10,11,12?) Maybe more. It's a bit unclear, but let's say they've chosen rock more often.\n\nIf they have a higher probability of choosing rock, then choosing paper gives me +3 if they choose rock, -1 if they choose scissors, and 0 if paper. If the probability of rock is high, paper is better. \n\nAlternatively, if they are more likely to choose scissors (if they think I'll choose paper), then rock would be better. \n\nBut given the history, they seem to choose rock a lot. So maybe paper is the safe choice. But the last time I chose paper, they chose scissors, which beat me. So maybe they are adapting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are cycling through moves. Let's see their sequence:\n\nFrom the rounds:\n\n1. Paper\n2. Rock\n3. Rock\n4. Rock\n5. Scissors\n6. Scissors\n7. Rock\n8. Rock\n9. Scissors\n10. Rock\n11. Rock\n12. Rock\n\nNot a clear cycle. It seems random, but with a bias towards rock. \n\nGiven that, the optimal move would be paper to counter rock. But since they might expect that and switch to scissors, maybe I should choose rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they lost the last round when they chose rock against my scissors, they might switch to paper. If they choose paper, I should choose scissors. But if they stick with rock, scissors would win. \n\nThis is a bit of a gamble. Given the uncertainty, maybe the best move is to choose paper again, hoping they stick with rock. But given that they might adapt, perhaps scissors is better. \n\nWait, if they think I'll switch from scissors to paper, they might choose scissors to beat my paper. So if I choose rock, I can beat their scissors. \n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the best approach is to stick with the statistical choice based on their most frequent move, which is rock. So choose paper. \n\nBut considering they might anticipate that, perhaps scissors is better. Wait, no. If they choose rock, scissors beat rock. If they choose paper, scissors lose. If they choose scissors, it's a tie. \n\nAlternatively, if they are likely to switch to paper after losing with rock, then scissors would beat paper. \n\nThis is really a guessing game. Given the uncertainty, I'll go with paper again, hoping they continue with rock.\n",

But maybe they'll stick with rock again if they think I'll try to counter their previous move. Wait, when I played paper and they played rock, they won, so maybe they expect me to avoid paper next.\n\nIf they think I'll switch from paper to scissors to beat their rock, they might play rock again to counter scissors. But if I play rock, then I can tie if they also play rock. Hmm, but I want to maximize points. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might play rock again. So if I play paper again, maybe they'll stick with rock and I can win. Wait, but last time I played paper, they played rock and I lost. So maybe they expect me to not play paper again. \n\nWait, the scoring is different. Rock beats paper gives them +3, which is a big incentive. So if they got a big reward for rock against paper, they might be more likely to play rock again. But if they think I'll avoid paper, they might switch to something else. Maybe scissors? If they switch to scissors, then I should play rock. But how to predict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are alternating moves. Let's look at the history:\n\nPrevious moves:\n- They played rock when I played scissors (I won)\n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost)\n- Then I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n- Then I played paper again, they played rock (I lost again)\n\nWait, the last two times I played paper, they played rock. So they might be sticking with rock. If they keep playing rock, then I should play paper to beat it. But each time I play paper, they play rock and I lose. So maybe they are consistently choosing rock. But why would they do that? Because they get +3 each time they beat my paper. So maybe they are sticking with rock because it's giving them high rewards. \n\nBut if they are a new player, maybe they don't have a strategy and just keep choosing the same move. If they keep choosing rock, then I need to counter with paper. But every time I do that, I lose. So maybe they are not sticking to rock. Wait, the last two times I played paper, they played rock. Then when I played scissors, they played rock again. So in the last three rounds, they played rock three times. So maybe they are sticking with rock. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat it. But each time I play paper, they play rock and I lose. Wait, no: paper loses to rock. So if they play rock and I play paper, I lose. So to beat rock, I should play paper? Wait no, rock beats paper. So to beat rock, I need to play paper? Wait, no. Wait the rules are:\n\n- paper beats scissors (paper wins, +1)\n- rock beats paper (rock wins, +3)\n- scissors beats rock (scissors win, +1)\n\nSo if they play rock, to beat them, I need to play paper? No, wait: rock beats paper. So if they play rock, and I play paper, they win. So to beat rock, I should play scissors. Wait, scissors beats rock. So scissors beats rock, giving me +1. So if they are playing rock, I should play scissors. But in the last round, I played paper, they played rock, I lost. Before that, I played scissors, they played rock, I won. So if they keep playing rock, I should play scissors. But why did I lose when I played paper? Because they played rock. So if they are consistently playing rock, I should play scissors. But in the last round, I played paper, they played rock again. So maybe they are sticking with rock. So next, I should play scissors to beat their rock. But wait, the last time I played scissors, they played rock, and I won. Then I played paper, they played rock again. So maybe they are just always playing rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors every time. But why did I switch to paper? Maybe I thought they would switch. But they didn't. So perhaps they are a bot that always plays rock. If that's the case, I should always play scissors. But let's check the history again:\n\nRound 1: Both paper (tie)\nRound 2: Both rock (tie)\nRound 3: I scissors, they rock (I won)\nRound 4: Both rock (tie)\nRound 5: Both scissors (tie)\nRound 6: I paper, they scissors (I won)\nRound 7: I paper, they rock (I lost)\nRound 8: I scissors, they rock (I won)\nRound 9: I paper, they rock (I lost)\nRound 10: I scissors, they rock (I won)\nRound 11: I paper, they rock (I lost)\n\nWait, the opponent's moves seem to be alternating between rock and scissors? Or maybe not. Let me list the opponent's moves based on the hints:\n\nFrom the hints given:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper (opponent played paper)\n- Round 2: Both rock (opponent played rock)\n- Round 3: I scissors, they rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 4: Both rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 5: Both scissors (opponent scissors)\n- Round 6: I paper, they scissors (opponent scissors)\n- Round 7: I paper, they rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 8: I scissors, they rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 9: I paper, they rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 10: I scissors, they rock (opponent rock)\n- Round 11: I paper, they rock (opponent rock)\n\nWait, after round 5, opponent played scissors. Then in round 6, opponent played scissors again (I played paper, they scissors, I won). Then in round 7, opponent switched to rock. Then from round 7 onwards, opponent has been playing rock every time except when I played scissors in round 8, they played rock again. So from round 7 to 11, opponent played rock every time except when I played scissors in round 8, they still played rock. So maybe the opponent is now consistently playing rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their rock. But in the last round, I played paper, they played rock again, so I lost. So if they keep playing rock, I should play scissors. But why did I play paper again? Maybe I thought they would switch, but they didn't. So perhaps the opponent is sticking with rock. Therefore, the optimal move is scissors. But let's confirm the rules again: scissors beats rock, giving me +1. So if they play rock, I play scissors, I win. If they switch to something else, like paper, then scissors would lose. But given their recent pattern, they are likely to play rock again. So I should play scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been choosing rock a lot. The last few times I played scissors, I won because they stuck with rock. But then when I switched to paper, expecting them to stay on rock, they actually chose rock again and I lost. Hmm. So maybe they're sticking with rock consistently. But after I won with scissors, they might think I'll switch to paper to counter their rock. Wait, but if they keep choosing rock, then scissors is the safe play. But maybe they're trying to predict my moves. Let me think.\n\nIn the last round, I played scissors and won. If they think I'll switch to paper next, they might play scissors to beat paper. But if I play rock instead, I can beat scissors. Alternatively, if they keep playing rock, then scissors is still good. But they might have noticed that I won twice with scissors and might expect me to continue. So maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my scissors. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. Wait, no. If they play paper, scissors would lose. Wait, paper beats scissors. So if they play paper, and I play scissors, I lose. But if they switch to paper expecting my scissors, then I should play rock to beat their paper. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are sticking with rock regardless. Let's look at the pattern. They played rock three times in a row, then scissors once, then rock again. Wait, no, let me check the history. \n\nWait, the last few moves: \n\n- When I played scissors, they played rock (I won). \n- Then I played paper, they played rock (I lost). \n- Then I played scissors again, they played rock (I won). \n- Then I played paper again, they played rock (I lost). \n- Then I played scissors, they played rock (I won). \n\nSo it seems like they are choosing rock almost every time. Except maybe once when they played scissors? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe rounds where I lost with paper were because they played rock. The rounds where I won with scissors were because they played rock. So the opponent is consistently choosing rock. So maybe they are sticking with rock as their main move. If that's the case, the best move is to play paper to beat rock. But wait, when I played paper before, they played rock, so I lost. Wait, no: paper beats rock, right? Wait, the rules say rock beats paper. Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the game rules are:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1.\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3.\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1.\n\nSo rock beats paper, paper beats scissors, scissors beats rock. So if the opponent is playing rock, then I should play paper to beat it, which gives me +3 points. But in the previous rounds when I played paper, they played rock, and I lost. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if I play paper and they play rock, then paper beats rock, so I should win. But in the history, when I played paper, I lost. Let me check:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- \"You made the move: paper. Your opponent made the move: rock. You scored -3 points.\" Wait, that's impossible. If I play paper and they play rock, paper should beat rock, so I should get +3. But the message says I lost. That must be a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided the rules as:\n\n- paper beats scissors: winner +1, loser -1.\n- rock beats paper: winner +3, loser -3.\n- scissors beats rock: winner +1, loser -1.\n\nSo rock beats paper, so if opponent plays rock and I play paper, then rock beats paper, so opponent wins +3, I lose -3. Oh! I got the direction wrong. So if I play paper and they play rock, they win because rock beats paper. So paper does not beat rock; rock beats paper. So the hierarchy is:\n\n- Rock > Paper\n- Paper > Scissors\n- Scissors > Rock\n\nSo if the opponent is playing rock, the correct counter is scissors, not paper. Because scissors beats rock. So when I played scissors, I won. When I played paper, I lost because rock beats paper. So my mistake earlier was thinking paper beats rock, but actually rock beats paper. So the correct move against rock is scissors. \n\nGiven that the opponent is consistently choosing rock, the best move is scissors. But in the last round, I played scissors and won. Now, the opponent might expect me to play scissors again and switch to paper to beat my scissors. If they switch to paper, then I should play rock to beat their paper. But if they keep playing rock, I should play scissors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are stuck in a loop of choosing rock. Let's see their pattern:\n\nThey played rock multiple times, even after I played scissors. So perhaps they are a bot that favors rock. If that's the case, continuing to play scissors is the way to go. But if they start adapting, they might switch. However, given the history, they haven't switched yet. So maybe sticking with scissors is safe. But let's check the last few rounds:\n\n1. I played scissors, they played rock: I won.\n2. I played paper, they played rock: I lost.\n3. I played scissors, they played rock: I won.\n4. I played paper, they played rock: I lost.\n5. I played scissors, they played rock: I won.\n\nSo every time I play scissors, they play rock, and I win. Every time I play paper, they play rock, and I lose. So they are consistently choosing rock. Therefore, the optimal move is scissors. But the opponent might catch on and switch to paper. However, given that they haven't switched yet, it's safer to assume they'll continue with rock. Therefore, the next move should be scissors again.\n",

It's a bit tricky. \n\nConsidering they just successfully countered me with paper, they might stick with paper expecting me to try rock. But if I play scissors again, I can beat their paper.

But how likely is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to cycle through moves. They started with rock, then paper, maybe next scissors. If that's the case, I should play rock to beat scissors. But that's a risky assumption. \n\nAlternatively, they might be using a pattern based on my previous moves. I played scissors three times, then scissors again, then they played paper. Now, if I switch to rock, they might expect that and play paper again. So maybe I should play scissors again, but that would lose to their paper. Alternatively, play paper to tie if they play paper again, but that doesn't gain points. \n\nWait, the goal is to maximize my points. So I need to predict their next move and choose the move that beats it. If I think they'll play paper again, I should play scissors to lose, which is bad. Wait, no, if they play paper, I need to play scissors to lose, which gives them a point. But I want to avoid that. Alternatively, if I think they'll switch back to rock, I should play paper. If they switch to scissors, I should play rock. \n\nBut how to predict their move? They just beat me with paper, so maybe they'll stick with it. Or they might think I'll switch to rock, so they'll play paper again. If I play paper, it's a tie. If I play scissors, I lose. If I play rock, I lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to paper to tie, they might switch to scissors to beat my paper. In that case, I should play rock to beat their scissors. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern. They played rock, then paper. If they cycle through, next would be scissors. So I should play rock to beat scissors. But that's assuming a cycle, which might not be the case. Alternatively, they might be reacting to my moves. Since I played scissors three times, then they switched to paper. Now, after losing with scissors, I might switch to rock, so they might play paper again. Therefore, I should play scissors again, but that would lose. Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to rock, they play paper, so I should play scissors to lose, but that's bad. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. They played rock, then paper, then maybe rock again. If that's the case, I should play paper to beat rock. But that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, since they just won with paper, they might stick with it. So I need to counter paper. The counter to paper is rock. Wait, no: rock beats paper.

But that's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll switch back to rock, thinking that I'll expect them to continue with paper. If they switch to rock, I should play paper. \n\nThis is a lot of second-guessing. Maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern in their moves. Let's list their moves so far:\n\nRound 1: paper (tie)\nRound 2: rock (tie)\nRound 3: scissors (I won)\nRound 4: rock (tie)\nRound 5: scissors (I won)\nRound 6: scissors (I won)\nRound 7: paper (they won)\nRound 8: rock (they won)\nRound 9: scissors (I won)\nRound 10: scissors (I won)\nRound 11: paper (they won)\nRound 12: ?\n\nWait, no, let me check the history based on the previous interactions. Let me go back through the rounds:\n\n1. First round: both played paper (tie)\n2. Second round: both played rock (tie)\n3. Third round: I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n4. Fourth round: both played rock (tie)\n5. I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n6. I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n7. I played scissors, they played paper (they won)\n8. I played rock, they played rock (tie)\n9. I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n10. I played scissors, they played rock (I won)\n11. I played scissors, they played paper (they won)\n12. Now, next move.\n\nWait, the opponent's moves seem to be alternating between rock and paper. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first two ties (paper and rock), they played rock in round 3 (I won with scissors). Then in round 4, they played rock again (tie). Then in round 5, they played rock again (I won with scissors). Round 6: they played rock again (I won with scissors). Then in round 7, they switched to paper (they won). Round 8: they played rock again (tie). Round 9: they played rock (I won). Round 10: they played rock (I won). Round 11: they played paper (they won). \n\nSo their pattern seems to be sticking with rock, occasionally switching to paper. After I kept beating their rock with scissors, they switched to paper once, then back to rock. Then after a few more rocks, they switched to paper again. It seems like they might be switching to paper after I have a streak of beating their rock. So after I beat their rock a few times, they switch to paper to counter my scissors. Then when I switch to rock (as in round 8), they played rock again. Then I went back to scissors, beating their rock again. Then they switched to paper again in round 11.\n\nSo the pattern is: when I use scissors to beat their rock multiple times, they switch to paper. Then when I adjust, they might switch back. So now, after they just played paper and won, they might expect me to switch to rock to beat their paper. If they think I'll play rock, they might play paper again. Or they might switch back to rock, thinking I'll go back to scissors. \n\nAlternatively, they might cycle between rock and paper. If they played paper last time, maybe they'll go back to rock. If that's the case, I should play scissors again. But if they stick with paper, scissors would lose. \n\nAlternatively, since they just succeeded with paper, they might stick with it. If I play rock, I can beat their paper and get +3. But if they anticipate that and play scissors, I lose. \n\nThis is a lot of possibilities. Maybe the best move is to play rock, expecting them to stick with paper. If they do, I get +3. If they switch to scissors, I lose -1. If they go back to rock, it's a tie. Considering they just won with paper, they might stick with it, so rock is a good choice. But there's a risk. Alternatively, play paper to tie if they stick with paper, but that doesn't help. Or play scissors, which loses to their paper but beats their rock. \n\nAlternatively, since they've switched to paper after my scissors streaks, maybe they'll expect me to switch to rock now. If they expect rock, they might play paper again. So I should play rock. But if they think I'll play rock, they might play paper. So rock would win. \n\nAlternatively, if they think I'll play rock, they might play scissors to beat it. So I should play paper to beat their scissors. But that's a third-level thought. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to alternate my moves. Since I just played scissors and lost, maybe switch to rock. If they play paper again, I win. If they play scissors, I lose. If they play rock, tie. \n\nAlternatively, since they've been using rock a lot, maybe they'll go back to it. So play scissors again. But they just switched to paper, so maybe they'll stick with it. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest bet is to play rock, hoping they stick with paper. The potential reward is higher (+3) compared to the risk (-1 if they play scissors). Alternatively, play paper to tie if they play paper again, but that's 0 points. \n\nAlternatively, if they're alternating between rock and paper, next would be rock. So play paper. But that's speculative. \n\nI think I'll go with rock, anticipating they'll stick with paper after just winning with it. So:\n\n[move] (Anticipating they'll continue with paper after winning last round) rock\n",

From the recent rounds:\n\n- Last round: Both chose paper (tie)\n- Before that: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won)\n- Before that: Both paper (tie)\n- Before that: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won)\n- Before that: Both paper (tie)\n- Before that: I chose scissors, they chose rock (I won)\n- Before that: Both rock (tie)\n- Before that: I chose scissors, they chose paper (I lost)\n- Before that: I chose rock, they chose paper (I won)\n- Before that: Both paper (tie)\n\nSo after a tie with paper, the opponent tends to switch to rock. For example, after the first paper tie, they switched to rock. Then after another paper tie, they switched to rock again. So maybe the pattern is that after a paper tie, they switch to rock. If that's the case, then choosing paper again would beat their expected rock. But in the last paper tie, they did switch to rock, and I chose scissors, which lost. Wait, no, in the last round where there was a paper tie, the next move they made was rock, and I chose scissors, which lost. Then I switched to rock, which beat their paper, and so on. \n\nSo if the opponent's pattern after a paper tie is to switch to rock, then I should choose paper to beat their rock. But in the last instance, after a paper tie, they did switch to rock, and I chose scissors, which lost. Then I chose rock, which beat their paper, and then they switched back to paper again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they alternate between rock and paper after ties. If the last tie was paper, they might switch to rock, then next time switch back to paper. But it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven that after a paper tie, they've been switching to rock, I should counter with paper. But if they instead decide to stick with paper again, it's another tie. Alternatively, if they think I'll anticipate their switch to rock and choose paper, they might stay with paper to force a tie. \n\nThis is a bit of a guessing game. Maybe the best approach is to vary my moves to avoid being predictable. Since I've been choosing paper after a tie, they might expect that and choose scissors. So maybe I should switch to rock to beat their scissors. But if they stick with paper, rock loses. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs, rock gives a higher reward (3 points) if it beats paper, but a higher penalty (-3) if it loses to scissors. Scissors gives 1 point for beating rock but -1 for losing to paper. Paper gives 1 point for beating scissors but -3 for losing to rock. \n\nGiven the risk-reward, maybe it's better to go with scissors, which has lower risk. But if they're likely to choose rock again, scissors would win. \n\nWait, in the last few rounds after a paper tie, they chose rock. So if I choose paper now, I can beat their expected rock. But if they instead choose scissors, I lose. However, given their history, they tend to switch to rock after a paper tie, so paper might be the safer choice. \n\nAlternatively, if they notice that I tend to counter their expected rock with paper, they might switch to scissors instead. So maybe I should choose rock to beat scissors. \n\nThis is a classic game theory problem. The optimal strategy might be to randomize moves, but since I need to choose deterministically, I have to predict their next move based on patterns. \n\nGiven the previous pattern of switching to rock after a paper tie, I'll go with paper again to beat rock. If they do switch to rock, I win. If they stay with paper, it's a tie. If they switch to scissors, I lose. But based on their history, rock is more likely.\n",

Alternatively, if they think I'll switch to scissors, they might switch to paper to beat my expected scissors. Wait, but if they switch to paper, then I should choose scissors. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at the history, after a tie with paper, they went rock and won. Then after another paper tie, they went rock again. Now they just beat my paper with rock. So maybe they're sticking with rock. If that's the case, I should choose paper to beat their rock. But they might anticipate that and switch to scissors. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're alternating. Let me think. \n\nWait, the last few moves: I played paper twice, they played rock once and then rock again. So they might be sticking with rock. If I play scissors, I can beat their rock. But they might expect me to switch to scissors after losing with paper. So maybe they'll switch to paper to beat my scissors. In that case, I should play scissors. But if they stay on rock, scissors wins. If they switch to paper, scissors loses. Alternatively, if I play rock, it ties if they stay on rock, but loses to paper. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are trying to counter my expected moves. Since I lost with paper, they might think I'll switch to scissors, so they'll play paper. If that's the case, I should play scissors to beat their paper. Wait, no. If they play paper, scissors would beat it. But if they think I'm switching to scissors, they might play rock to beat my scissors. This is getting a bit too convoluted. \n\nMaybe the opponent is sticking with rock because it's been working. They just beat my paper with rock. If they keep choosing rock, then I should choose paper to beat it. But they might expect that and switch. Alternatively, maybe they're not changing. Let's look at the pattern. The last few rounds:\n\n- They played rock and won against my paper.\n- Then I played scissors, they played paper, I lost.\n- Then I played rock, they played paper, I won.\n- Then I played paper, they played rock again, I lost.\n\nSo there's some inconsistency. Maybe they alternate between rock and paper. If the last move was rock, maybe they switch to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat paper. But if they stay on rock, scissors loses. Alternatively, if they switch to paper, scissors wins. But this is risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should play rock. If they expect me to switch from paper to scissors, they might play rock again. Then rock would tie. But if they switch to paper, rock loses. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, considering the payoffs: rock beats paper for 3 points, which is a higher reward. Maybe the opponent is favoring rock for higher gains. If they keep choosing rock, I should choose paper. But they might have noticed that I tried paper twice and lost, so they might expect me to switch. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to switch to scissors, expecting them to stay on rock. But if they do stay on rock, scissors wins. If they switch to paper, scissors loses. Alternatively, play rock to tie if they stay on rock. But I need to maximize points. \n\nWait, the last time they played rock, I lost with paper. If I play scissors now, and they play rock again, I win. If they switch to paper, I lose. But given that they've been using rock multiple times, maybe they'll stick with it. Let's go with scissors.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using rock a lot, especially when I played scissors and won. But in the last round, they switched to rock again, and I countered with scissors, which worked. Now, after that win, they might expect me to stick with scissors again. But if they think I'll repeat, they might switch to paper to beat my scissors. Wait, but if they keep using rock, then scissors is still good. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they noticed a pattern. Let's recap recent moves: I played scissors and won, then paper which tied, then scissors again and won. They might try to predict my next move. If I keep using scissors, they might go for paper. So maybe I should switch to rock to beat their potential paper. But if they stick with rock, then paper would be better. This is tricky.\n\nWait, the last few rounds: they lost with rock against my scissors, then tied with paper, then lost again with rock. Maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. If that's the case, after two rocks, they might go back to paper. If I play scissors, I can beat their paper. But if they stay with rock, scissors still wins. Wait, no, scissors beats paper, but loses to rock. So if they play rock again, scissors would lose. But if they switch to paper, scissors would win. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my scissors by switching to paper. So if I play rock, I can beat their paper. But if they stick with rock, rock ties. Wait, but rock vs rock is a tie. So maybe rock is a safer choice if I'm unsure. But I want to maximize points. Let's check the payoffs: rock beats paper for +3, which is a big gain. If I play rock and they play paper, I get 3 points. If they play scissors, I lose 1. If they play rock, it's a tie. Considering they might switch to paper after losing with rock, rock could be a good move. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I play paper, it beats rock for +3, but if they play scissors, I lose 1. But they might not expect paper after I've been using scissors. Hmm. Maybe I should mix it up. Let's go with paper this time to counter their possible rock again. Wait, but they just lost with rock, so maybe they'll switch. If they switch to paper, then my paper ties. If they switch to scissors, my paper loses. Alternatively, if they stick with rock, paper wins. It's a gamble. Alternatively, maybe they'll go back to scissors, expecting me to counter rock. This is getting complicated. Maybe the best bet is to go with paper, expecting them to stay with rock. Let's try that.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The opponent has been using rock a lot, especially when I tried scissors and won. But when I switched to paper, they sometimes stuck with rock, leading me to lose. Wait, in the last round, I chose paper expecting their rock, but they actually chose rock again, so I lost. Hmm, maybe they're sticking with rock consistently. But earlier, when I used scissors, they did switch to paper once. So maybe there's a pattern of them switching after a loss. Let me think.\n\nIf they lost with rock last time, maybe they'll switch to paper to counter scissors. But if they keep choosing rock, then scissors would win. But in the last round, they chose rock again even after I used scissors. Wait, no, the last round I used paper and they used rock, so I lost. So maybe they're not switching as much. Maybe they're sticking with rock. But how to counter that? If they keep choosing rock, then paper would lose, but scissors would win. Wait, no: scissors beats rock, right? Wait, no, according to the rules, scissors beats rock gives the winner 1 point. So scissors beats rock. So if they keep choosing rock, I should choose scissors. But in the last round, I chose paper and they chose rock, so I lost. So maybe they are sticking with rock. But why did they choose rock again? Maybe they are trying to counter my scissors. Wait, but if I keep choosing scissors, they might switch to paper. But in the previous rounds, when I chose scissors, they sometimes chose paper, leading me to lose. So maybe there's a cycle here. Let me try to track their moves.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Round 1: Both paper. Tie.\n- Round 2: Both rock. Tie.\n- Round 3: I chose scissors, they rock. I won.\n- Round 4: Both rock. Tie.\n- Round 5: I scissors, they rock. I won.\n- Round 6: I scissors, they paper. I lost.\n- Round 7: I rock, they paper. I won.\n- Round 8: Both paper. Tie.\n- Round 9: I rock, they paper. I won.\n- Round 10: Both paper. Tie.\n- Round 11: I paper, they rock. I lost.\n- Round 12: I scissors, they rock. I won.\n- Round 13: I paper, they rock. I lost.\n- Round 14: I scissors, they rock. I won.\n- Round 15: I paper, they rock. I lost.\n\nWait, the opponent seems to be choosing rock a lot, especially after I use paper. But when I use scissors, they sometimes switch to paper. It's a bit inconsistent. Maybe they're alternating between rock and paper. Or perhaps they have a pattern of choosing rock after a loss. Let me try to predict. Since in the last round, they chose rock again when I used paper, maybe they're sticking with rock. So if I choose scissors, I can beat their rock. But earlier when I did that, they sometimes switched to paper. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're trying to counter my scissors by switching to paper. But in the last few rounds, they've been on rock. Maybe I should switch back to scissors to beat their rock. But I need to be careful if they switch to paper. Alternatively, maybe they expect me to choose scissors again, so they'll choose paper. In that case, I should choose rock. But this is getting complicated. Let's see the recent pattern:\n\nLast few moves:\n\n- I chose paper, they rock (I lost)\n- I chose scissors, they rock (I won)\n- I chose paper, they rock (I lost)\n- Now, if I choose scissors again, maybe they'll stick with rock, so I win. But if they switch to paper, I lose. Alternatively, if they expect me to choose scissors, they might choose paper, so I should choose rock. But this is a guessing game. Maybe the opponent is not changing much and keeps choosing rock. So scissors would be safe. Let's try scissors again.\n",

Then reason through the steps, until a final decision is reached. The steps should reflect a meaningful thought process.\n\nHere is an example on a simpler task from what you will be playing:\n\n---\nExample Task: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does Roger have now?\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.\n2. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each are bought. This is 2 * 3 = 6 tennis balls.\n3. Roger now has 5 + 6 = 11 tennis balls.\n\nFinish steps!\n\nFinal decision: 11 tennis balls\n\n---\n\nNow, the game you will be playing is presented. Think step-by-step. Identify the steps and reason through them to complete the objective of the game. You may come up with different reasoning steps for each round, as you see fit.\n\nGame Description:\n\nYou are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: paper, rock, and scissors.\n- paper beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- rock beats paper giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats rock giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n- Do not use markdown formatting in your messages (e.g., bold text, italic text, etc.).\n",
