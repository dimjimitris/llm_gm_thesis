    "system_prompt": "You are playing a game against other player(s). The game is based on making moves.\n\nGame Description:\nThere are three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.\n- rock beats scissors giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- paper beats rock giving the winner 3 points and the loser -3 points.\n- scissors beats paper giving the winner 1 points and the loser -1 points.\n- If both players make the same move, the game is a tie and no points are awarded.\n\nIn each round of the game you play against one other player. You and the other player each make a move privately. The moves are compared and you and the other player get your reward/penalty based on the moves made.\n\nMessage Formats:\nMove messages are sent when you want to make a move.\nMove messages are formatted like this:\n[move] (Optional explanation here) Your move here\n\nHint messages are received when you are provided with advice and directions. These messages are important and you should pay attention to them.\nHint messages are formatted like this:\n[hint] Hint message here\n\nObjective:\nMaximize your points and/or minimize your penalties.\n\nTips:\n- Try to formulate a strategy by reasoning on the provided information.\n- Pay attention to the payoff matrix of the game moves.\n- You should only send move messages. Hint messages will only be provided to you.\n- Pay attention to hints when provided.\n",

Paper offers the highest reward if successful (+3), but also carries the highest risk (-3). Rock and scissors have more balanced risk/reward profiles.\n\nWithout prior information about my opponent's tendencies, a common opening strategy is to choose rock, as many players instinctively play rock first.

However, they've now played paper twice with other moves in between, which could indicate a new pattern forming or a return to an earlier strategy.\n\nIf they were following the counter-clockwise pattern, they would have played scissors. Since they played paper instead, they might be:\n1. Breaking patterns deliberately\n2. Returning to an earlier pattern\n3. Responding to my moves tactically\n\nGiven their most recent play of paper and considering our interaction history, they might expect me to play scissors again (since it just worked). To counter this anticipated scissors play, they would likely play rock:\n\n[move] Paper\n"
